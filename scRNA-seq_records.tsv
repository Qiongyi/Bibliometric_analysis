Batch effect correction has been recognized to be indispensable when integrating single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from multiple batches. State-of-the-art methods ignore single-cell cluster label information, but such information can improve the effectiveness of batch effect correction, particularly under realistic scenarios where biological differences are not orthogonal to batch effects. To address this issue, we propose SMNN for batch effect correction of scRNA-seq data via supervised mutual nearest neighbor detection. Our extensive evaluations in simulated and real datasets show that SMNN provides improved merging within the corresponding cell types across batches, leading to reduced differentiation across batches over MNN, Seurat v3 and LIGER. Furthermore, SMNN retains more cell-type-specific features, partially manifested by differentially expressed genes identified between cell types after SMNN correction being biologically more relevant, with precision improving by up to 841.0%.
38940157	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Accurate assembly of multiple RNA-seq samples with Aletsch.	"MOTIVATION: High-throughput RNA sequencing has become indispensable for decoding gene activities, yet the challenge of reconstructing full-length transcripts persists. Traditional single-sample assemblers frequently produce fragmented transcripts, especially in single-cell RNA-seq data. While algorithms designed for assembling multiple samples exist, they encounter various limitations. RESULTS: We present Aletsch, a new assembler for multiple bulk or single-cell RNA-seq samples. Aletsch incorporates several algorithmic innovations, including a ""bridging"" system that can effectively integrate multiple samples to restore missed junctions in individual samples, and a new graph-decomposition algorithm that leverages ""supporting"" information across multiple samples to guide the decomposition of complex vertices. A standout feature of Aletsch is its application of a random forest model with 50 well-designed features for scoring transcripts. We demonstrate its robust adaptability across different chromosomes, datasets, and species. Our experiments, conducted on RNA-seq data from several protocols, firmly demonstrate Aletsch's significant outperformance over existing meta-assemblers. As an example, when measured with the partial area under the precision-recall curve (pAUC, constrained by precision), Aletsch surpasses the leading assemblers TransMeta by 22.9%-62.1% and PsiCLASS by 23.0%-175.5% on human datasets. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Aletsch is freely available at https://github.com/Shao-Group/aletsch. Scripts that reproduce the experimental results of this manuscript is available at https://github.com/Shao-Group/aletsch-test."
37941153	2023	Nucleic acids research	Probabilistic cell/domain-type assignment of spatial transcriptomics data with SpatialAnno.	In the analysis of both single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) data, classifying cells/spots into cell/domain types is an essential analytic step for many secondary analyses. Most of the existing annotation methods have been developed for scRNA-seq datasets without any consideration of spatial information. Here, we present SpatialAnno, an efficient and accurate annotation method for spatial transcriptomics datasets, with the capability to effectively leverage a large number of non-marker genes as well as 'qualitative' information about marker genes without using a reference dataset. Uniquely, SpatialAnno estimates low-dimensional embeddings for a large number of non-marker genes via a factor model while promoting spatial smoothness among neighboring spots via a Potts model. Using both simulated and four real spatial transcriptomics datasets from the 10x Visium, ST, Slide-seqV1/2, and seqFISH platforms, we showcase the method's improved spatial annotation accuracy, including its robustness to the inclusion of marker genes for irrelevant cell/domain types and to various degrees of marker gene misspecification. SpatialAnno is computationally scalable and applicable to SRT datasets from different platforms. Furthermore, the estimated embeddings for cellular biological effects facilitate many downstream analyses.
35561168	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Airpart: interpretable statistical models for analyzing allelic imbalance in single-cell datasets.	MOTIVATION: Allelic expression analysis aids in detection of cis-regulatory mechanisms of genetic variation, which produce allelic imbalance (AI) in heterozygotes. Measuring AI in bulk data lacking time or spatial resolution has the limitation that cell-type-specific (CTS), spatial- or time-dependent AI signals may be dampened or not detected. RESULTS: We introduce a statistical method airpart for identifying differential CTS AI from single-cell RNA-sequencing data, or dynamics AI from other spatially or time-resolved datasets. airpart outputs discrete partitions of data, pointing to groups of genes and cells under common mechanisms of cis-genetic regulation. In order to account for low counts in single-cell data, our method uses a Generalized Fused Lasso with Binomial likelihood for partitioning groups of cells by AI signal, and a hierarchical Bayesian model for AI statistical inference. In simulation, airpart accurately detected partitions of cell types by their AI and had lower Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of allelic ratio estimates than existing methods. In real data, airpart identified differential allelic imbalance patterns across cell states and could be used to define trends of AI signal over spatial or time axes. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The airpart package is available as an R/Bioconductor package at https://bioconductor.org/packages/airpart. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
34088715	2021	Genome research	A machine learning method for the discovery of minimum marker gene combinations for cell type identification from single-cell RNA sequencing.	Single-cell genomics is rapidly advancing our knowledge of the diversity of cell phenotypes, including both cell types and cell states. Driven by single-cell/-nucleus RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), comprehensive cell atlas projects characterizing a wide range of organisms and tissues are currently underway. As a result, it is critical that the transcriptional phenotypes discovered are defined and disseminated in a consistent and concise manner. Molecular biomarkers have historically played an important role in biological research, from defining immune cell types by surface protein expression to defining diseases by their molecular drivers. Here, we describe a machine learning-based marker gene selection algorithm, NS-Forest version 2.0, which leverages the nonlinear attributes of random forest feature selection and a binary expression scoring approach to discover the minimal marker gene expression combinations that optimally capture the cell type identity represented in complete scRNA-seq transcriptional profiles. The marker genes selected provide an expression barcode that serves as both a useful tool for downstream biological investigation and the necessary and sufficient characteristics for semantic cell type definition. The use of NS-Forest to identify marker genes for human brain middle temporal gyrus cell types reveals the importance of cell signaling and noncoding RNAs in neuronal cell type identity.
25599176	2015	Nature biotechnology	Computational analysis of cell-to-cell heterogeneity in single-cell RNA-sequencing data reveals hidden subpopulations of cells.	Recent technical developments have enabled the transcriptomes of hundreds of cells to be assayed in an unbiased manner, opening up the possibility that new subpopulations of cells can be found. However, the effects of potential confounding factors, such as the cell cycle, on the heterogeneity of gene expression and therefore on the ability to robustly identify subpopulations remain unclear. We present and validate a computational approach that uses latent variable models to account for such hidden factors. We show that our single-cell latent variable model (scLVM) allows the identification of otherwise undetectable subpopulations of cells that correspond to different stages during the differentiation of naive T cells into T helper 2 cells. Our approach can be used not only to identify cellular subpopulations but also to tease apart different sources of gene expression heterogeneity in single-cell transcriptomes.
39147582	2024	Genome research	Benchmarking bulk and single-cell variant-calling approaches on Chromium scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq libraries.	Single-cell sequencing methodologies such as scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq have become widespread and effective tools to interrogate tissue composition. Increasingly, variant callers are being applied to these methodologies to resolve the genetic heterogeneity of a sample, especially in the case of detecting the clonal architecture of a tumor. Typically, traditional bulk DNA variant callers are applied to the pooled reads of a single-cell library to detect candidate mutations. Recently, multiple studies have applied such callers on reads from individual cells, with some citing the ability to detect rare variants with higher sensitivity. Many studies apply these two approaches to the Chromium (10x Genomics) scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq methodologies. However, Chromium-based libraries may offer additional challenges to variant calling compared with existing single-cell methodologies, raising questions regarding the validity of variants obtained from such a workflow. To determine the merits and challenges of various variant-calling approaches on Chromium scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq libraries, we use sample libraries with matched bulk whole-genome sequencing to evaluate the performance of callers. We review caller performance, finding that bulk callers applied on pooled reads significantly outperform individual-cell approaches. We also evaluate variants unique to scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq methodologies, finding patterns of noise but also potential capture of RNA-editing events. Finally, we review the notion that variant calling at the single-cell level can detect rare somatic variants, providing empirical results that suggest resolving such variants is infeasible in single-cell Chromium libraries.
36534702	2022	PLoS computational biology	scDSSC: Deep Sparse Subspace Clustering for scRNA-seq Data.	Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables researchers to characterize transcriptomic profiles at the single-cell resolution with increasingly high throughput. Clustering is a crucial step in single cell analysis. Clustering analysis of transcriptome profiled by scRNA-seq can reveal the heterogeneity and diversity of cells. However, single cell study still remains great challenges due to its high noise and dimension. Subspace clustering aims at discovering the intrinsic structure of data in unsupervised fashion. In this paper, we propose a deep sparse subspace clustering method scDSSC combining noise reduction and dimensionality reduction for scRNA-seq data, which simultaneously learns feature representation and clustering via explicit modelling of scRNA-seq data generation. Experiments on a variety of scRNA-seq datasets from thousands to tens of thousands of cells have shown that scDSSC can significantly improve clustering performance and facilitate the interpretability of clustering and downstream analysis. Compared to some popular scRNA-deq analysis methods, scDSSC outperformed state-of-the-art methods under various clustering performance metrics.
36047285	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	DEMOC: a deep embedded multi-omics learning approach for clustering single-cell CITE-seq data.	Advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies has provided an unprecedent opportunity for cell-type identification. As clustering is an effective strategy towards cell-type identification, various computational approaches have been proposed for clustering scRNA-seq data. Recently, with the emergence of cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq), the cell surface expression of specific proteins and the RNA expression on the same cell can be captured, which provides more comprehensive information for cell analysis. However, existing single cell clustering algorithms are mainly designed for single-omic data, and have difficulties in handling multi-omics data with diverse characteristics efficiently. In this study, we propose a novel deep embedded multi-omics clustering with collaborative training (DEMOC) model to perform joint clustering on CITE-seq data. Our model can take into account the characteristics of transcriptomic and proteomic data, and make use of the consistent and complementary information provided by different data sources effectively. Experiment results on two real CITE-seq datasets demonstrate that our DEMOC model not only outperforms state-of-the-art single-omic clustering methods, but also achieves better and more stable performance than existing multi-omics clustering methods. We also apply our model on three scRNA-seq datasets to assess the performance of our model in rare cell-type identification, novel cell-subtype detection and cellular heterogeneity analysis. Experiment results illustrate the effectiveness of our model in discovering the underlying patterns of data.
35484598	2022	Genome biology	Systematic evaluation of colorectal cancer organoid system by single-cell RNA-Seq analysis.	BACKGROUND: Patient-derived organoid culture is a powerful system for studying the molecular mechanisms of cancers, especially colorectal cancer (CRC), one of the most prevalent cancers worldwide. There are two main types of 3D culture methods for colonic cells, but the similarities and differences between gene expression patterns in different culture media remain largely unexplored. RESULTS: Here, we establish patient-derived organoids from colorectal cancer patients and perform single-cell RNA-Seq for pairwise samples from seven patients for both organoids and their corresponding tumor and normal tissues in vivo. We find that organoids derived from tumor tissues faithfully recapitulate the main gene expression signatures of cancer cells in vivo. On the other hand, organoids derived from normal tissues exhibited some tumor-like features at the whole transcriptome level but retained normal genomic features, such as CNVs, point mutations, and normal global DNA methylation levels, for both cultural media. More importantly, we show that conditioned medium outperforms chemical-defined medium in long-term culture of tumor epithelial cells. Finally, we mutually exchange the culture medium for the organoids and find that after interchanging the medium, the organoid cells basically maintain the transcriptome characteristics of the original medium. CONCLUSIONS: Our work gives a thorough evaluation of both the cultural conditions and the biological features of organoids of CRC patients.
38684178	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scTPC: a novel semisupervised deep clustering model for scRNA-seq data.	"MOTIVATION: Continuous advancements in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology have enabled researchers to further explore the study of cell heterogeneity, trajectory inference, identification of rare cell types, and neurology. Accurate scRNA-seq data clustering is crucial in single-cell sequencing data analysis. However, the high dimensionality, sparsity, and presence of ""false"" zero values in the data can pose challenges to clustering. Furthermore, current unsupervised clustering algorithms have not effectively leveraged prior biological knowledge, making cell clustering even more challenging. RESULTS: This study investigates a semisupervised clustering model called scTPC, which integrates the triplet constraint, pairwise constraint, and cross-entropy constraint based on deep learning. Specifically, the model begins by pretraining a denoising autoencoder based on a zero-inflated negative binomial distribution. Deep clustering is then performed in the learned latent feature space using triplet constraints and pairwise constraints generated from partial labeled cells. Finally, to address imbalanced cell-type datasets, a weighted cross-entropy loss is introduced to optimize the model. A series of experimental results on 10 real scRNA-seq datasets and five simulated datasets demonstrate that scTPC achieves accurate clustering with a well-designed framework. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: scTPC is a Python-based algorithm, and the code is available from https://github.com/LF-Yang/Code or https://zenodo.org/records/10951780."
40662790	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Refinement strategies for Tangram for reliable single-cell to spatial mapping.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides comprehensive gene expression data at a single-cell level but lacks spatial context. In contrast, spatial transcriptomics captures both spatial and transcriptional information but is limited by resolution, sensitivity, or feasibility. No single technology combines both the high spatial resolution and deep transcriptomic profiling at the single-cell level without tradeoffs. Spatial mapping tools that integrate scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data are crucial to bridge this gap. However, we found that Tangram, one of the most prominent spatial mapping tools, provides inconsistent results over repeated runs. RESULTS: We refine Tangram to achieve more consistent cell mappings and investigate the challenges that arise from data characteristics. We find that the mapping quality depends on the gene expression sparsity. To address this, we (1) train the model on an informative gene subset, (2) apply cell filtering, (3) introduce several forms of regularization, and (4) incorporate neighborhood information. Evaluations on real and simulated mouse datasets demonstrate that this approach improves both gene expression prediction and cell mapping. Consistent cell mapping strengthens the reliability of the projection of cell annotations and features into space, gene imputation, and correction of low-quality measurements. Our pipeline, which includes gene set and hyperparameter selection, can serve as guidance for applying Tangram on other datasets, while our benchmarking framework with data simulation and inconsistency metrics is useful for evaluating other tools or Tangram modifications. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The refinements for Tangram and our benchmarking pipeline are available at https://github.com/daisybio/Tangram_Refinement_Strategies.
34553223	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	Integrating single-cell datasets with ambiguous batch information by incorporating molecular network features.	With the rapid development of single-cell sequencing techniques, several large-scale cell atlas projects have been launched across the world. However, it is still challenging to integrate single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) datasets with diverse tissue sources, developmental stages and/or few overlaps, due to the ambiguity in determining the batch information, which is particularly important for current batch-effect correction methods. Here, we present SCORE, a simple network-based integration methodology, which incorporates curated molecular network features to infer cellular states and generate a unified workflow for integrating scRNA-seq datasets. Validating on real single-cell datasets, we showed that regardless of batch information, SCORE outperforms existing methods in accuracy, robustness, scalability and data integration.
33535230	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	jSRC: a flexible and accurate joint learning algorithm for clustering of single-cell RNA-sequencing data.	Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) explores the transcriptome of genes at cell level, which sheds light on revealing the heterogeneity and dynamics of cell populations. Advances in biotechnologies make it possible to generate scRNA-seq profiles for large-scale cells, requiring effective and efficient clustering algorithms to identify cell types and informative genes. Although great efforts have been devoted to clustering of scRNA-seq, the accuracy, scalability and interpretability of available algorithms are not desirable. In this study, we solve these problems by developing a joint learning algorithm [a.k.a. joints sparse representation and clustering (jSRC)], where the dimension reduction (DR) and clustering are integrated. Specifically, DR is employed for the scalability and joint learning improves accuracy. To increase the interpretability of patterns, we assume that cells within the same type have similar expression patterns, where the sparse representation is imposed on features. We transform clustering of scRNA-seq into an optimization problem and then derive the update rules to optimize the objective of jSRC. Fifteen scRNA-seq datasets from various tissues and organisms are adopted to validate the performance of jSRC, where the number of single cells varies from 49 to 110 824. The experimental results demonstrate that jSRC significantly outperforms 12 state-of-the-art methods in terms of various measurements (on average 20.29% by improvement) with fewer running time. Furthermore, jSRC is efficient and robust across different scRNA-seq datasets from various tissues. Finally, jSRC also accurately identifies dynamic cell types associated with progression of COVID-19. The proposed model and methods provide an effective strategy to analyze scRNA-seq data (the software is coded using MATLAB and is free for academic purposes; https://github.com/xkmaxidian/jSRC).
34764492	2022	Nature biotechnology	Identifying phenotype-associated subpopulations by integrating bulk and single-cell sequencing data.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) distinguishes cell types, states and lineages within the context of heterogeneous tissues. However, current single-cell data cannot directly link cell clusters with specific phenotypes. Here we present Scissor, a method that identifies cell subpopulations from single-cell data that are associated with a given phenotype. Scissor integrates phenotype-associated bulk expression data and single-cell data by first quantifying the similarity between each single cell and each bulk sample. It then optimizes a regression model on the correlation matrix with the sample phenotype to identify relevant subpopulations. Applied to a lung cancer scRNA-seq dataset, Scissor identified subsets of cells associated with worse survival and with TP53 mutations. In melanoma, Scissor discerned a T cell subpopulation with low PDCD1/CTLA4 and high TCF7 expression associated with an immunotherapy response. Beyond cancer, Scissor was effective in interpreting facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy and Alzheimer's disease datasets. Scissor identifies biologically and clinically relevant cell subpopulations from single-cell assays by leveraging phenotype and bulk-omics datasets.
39710434	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	PAGE-based transfer learning from single-cell to bulk sequencing enhances model generalization for sepsis diagnosis.	Sepsis, caused by infections, sparks a dangerous bodily response. The transcriptional expression patterns of host responses aid in the diagnosis of sepsis, but the challenge lies in their limited generalization capabilities. To facilitate sepsis diagnosis, we present an updated version of single-cell Pair-wise Analysis of Gene Expression (scPAGE) using transfer learning method, scPAGE2, dedicated to data fusion between single-cell and bulk transcriptome. Compared to scPAGE, the upgrade to scPAGE2 featured ameliorated Differentially Expressed Gene Pairs (DEPs) for pretraining a model in single-cell transcriptome and retrained it using bulk transcriptome data to construct a sepsis diagnostic model, which effectively transferred cell-layer information from single-cell to bulk transcriptome. Seven datasets across three transcriptome platforms and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) were used for performance validation. The model involved four DEPs, showing robust performance across next-generation sequencing and microarray platforms, surpassing state-of-the-art models with an average AUROC of 0.947 and an average AUPRC of 0.987. Analysis of scRNA-seq data reveals higher cell proportions with JAM3-PIK3AP1 expression in sepsis monocytes, decreased ARG1-CCR7 in B and T cells. Elevated IRF6-HP in sepsis monocytes confirmed by both scRNA-seq and an independent cohort using FACS. Both the superior performance of the model and the in vitro validation of IRF6-HP in monocytes emphasize that scPAGE2 is effective and robust in the construction of sepsis diagnostic model. We additionally applied scPAGE2 to acute myeloid leukemia and demonstrated its superior classification performance. Overall, we provided a strategy to improve the generalizability of classification model that can be adapted to a broad range of clinical prediction scenarios.
35021202	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	A comprehensive comparison of supervised and unsupervised methods for cell type identification in single-cell RNA-seq.	The cell type identification is among the most important tasks in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis. Many in silico methods have been developed and can be roughly categorized as either supervised or unsupervised. In this study, we investigated the performances of 8 supervised and 10 unsupervised cell type identification methods using 14 public scRNA-seq datasets of different tissues, sequencing protocols and species. We investigated the impacts of a number of factors, including total amount of cells, number of cell types, sequencing depth, batch effects, reference bias, cell population imbalance, unknown/novel cell type, and computational efficiency and scalability. Instead of merely comparing individual methods, we focused on factors' impacts on the general category of supervised and unsupervised methods. We found that in most scenarios, the supervised methods outperformed the unsupervised methods, except for the identification of unknown cell types. This is particularly true when the supervised methods use a reference dataset with high informational sufficiency, low complexity and high similarity to the query dataset. However, such outperformance could be undermined by some undesired dataset properties investigated in this study, which lead to uninformative and biased reference datasets. In these scenarios, unsupervised methods could be comparable to supervised methods. Our study not only explained the cell typing methods' behaviors under different experimental settings but also provided a general guideline for the choice of method according to the scientific goal and dataset properties. Finally, our evaluation workflow is implemented as a modularized R pipeline that allows future evaluation of new methods. Availability: All the source codes are available at https://github.com/xsun28/scRNAIdent.
33147626	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	CellTalkDB: a manually curated database of ligand-receptor interactions in humans and mice.	Cell-cell communications in multicellular organisms generally involve secreted ligand-receptor (LR) interactions, which is vital for various biological phenomena. Recent advancements in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have effectively resolved cellular phenotypic heterogeneity and the cell-type composition of complex tissues, facilitating the systematic investigation of cell-cell communications at single-cell resolution. However, assessment of chemical-signal-dependent cell-cell communication through scRNA-seq relies heavily on prior knowledge of LR interaction pairs. We constructed CellTalkDB (http://tcm.zju.edu.cn/celltalkdb), a manually curated comprehensive database of LR interaction pairs in humans and mice comprising 3398 human LR pairs and 2033 mouse LR pairs, through text mining and manual verification of known protein-protein interactions using the STRING database, with literature-supported evidence for each pair. Compared with SingleCellSignalR, the largest LR-pair resource, CellTalkDB includes not only 2033 mouse LR pairs but also 377 additional human LR pairs. In conclusion, the data on human and mouse LR pairs contained in CellTalkDB could help to further the inference and understanding of the LR-interaction-based cell-cell communications, which might provide new insights into the mechanism underlying biological processes.
25096407	2014	Genome research	Cell fate inclination within 2-cell and 4-cell mouse embryos revealed by single-cell RNA sequencing.	It remains an open question when and how the first cell fate decision is made in mammals. Using deep single-cell RNA-seq of matched sister blastomeres, we report highly reproducible inter-blastomere differences among 10 2-cell and five 4-cell mouse embryos. Inter-blastomere gene expression differences dominated between-embryo differences and noise, and were sufficient to cluster sister blastomeres into distinct groups. Dozens of protein-coding genes exhibited reproducible bimodal expression in sister blastomeres, which cannot be explained by random fluctuations. The protein expression of one gene out of four of these bimodal genes tested, Gadd45a, exhibited clear inter-blastomeric contrasts. We traced some of the bimodal mRNA expressions to embryonic genome activation, and others to blastomere-specific RNA depletion. Inter-blastomere differences created coexpression gene networks that were much stronger and larger than those that can possibly be created by random noise. The highly correlated gene pairs at the 4-cell stage overlapped with those showing the same directions of differential expression between inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE). These data substantiate the hypothesis of inter-blastomere differences in 2- and 4-cell mouse embryos, and associate these differences with ICM/TE differences.
34791375	2022	Nucleic acids research	DISCO: a database of Deeply Integrated human Single-Cell Omics data.	The ability to study cellular heterogeneity at single cell resolution is making single-cell sequencing increasingly popular. However, there is no publicly available resource that offers an integrated cell atlas with harmonized metadata that users can integrate new data with. Here, we present DISCO (https://www.immunesinglecell.org/), a database of Deeply Integrated Single-Cell Omics data. The current release of DISCO integrates more than 18 million cells from 4593 samples, covering 107 tissues/cell lines/organoids, 158 diseases, and 20 platforms. We standardized the associated metadata with a controlled vocabulary and ontology system. To allow large scale integration of single-cell data, we developed FastIntegration, a fast and high-capacity version of Seurat Integration. We also developed CELLiD, an atlas guided automatic cell type identification tool. Employing these two tools on the assembled data, we constructed one global atlas and 27 sub-atlases for different tissues, diseases, and cell types. DISCO provides three online tools, namely Online FastIntegration, Online CELLiD, and CellMapper, for users to integrate, annotate, and project uploaded single-cell RNA-seq data onto a selected atlas. Collectively, DISCO is a versatile platform for users to explore published single-cell data and efficiently perform integrated analysis with their own data.
38290765	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Scbean: a python library for single-cell multi-omics data analysis.	SUMMARY: Single-cell multi-omics technologies provide a unique platform for characterizing cell states and reconstructing developmental process by simultaneously quantifying and integrating molecular signatures across various modalities, including genome, transcriptome, epigenome, and other omics layers.

38409056	2024	Genome biology	A comparison of marker gene selection methods for single-cell RNA sequencing data.	BACKGROUND: The development of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has enabled scientists to catalog and probe the transcriptional heterogeneity of individual cells in unprecedented detail. A common step in the analysis of scRNA-seq data is the selection of so-called marker genes, most commonly to enable annotation of the biological cell types present in the sample. In this paper, we benchmark 59 computational methods for selecting marker genes in scRNA-seq data. RESULTS: We compare the performance of the methods using 14 real scRNA-seq datasets and over 170 additional simulated datasets. Methods are compared on their ability to recover simulated and expert-annotated marker genes, the predictive performance and characteristics of the gene sets they select, their memory usage and speed, and their implementation quality. In addition, various case studies are used to scrutinize the most commonly used methods, highlighting issues and inconsistencies. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we present a comprehensive evaluation of methods for selecting marker genes in scRNA-seq data. Our results highlight the efficacy of simple methods, especially the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Student's t-test, and logistic regression.
37791583	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Cracking the pattern of tumor evolution based on single-cell copy number alterations.	Copy number alterations (CNAs) are a key characteristic of tumor development and progression. The accumulation of various CNAs during tumor development plays a critical role in driving tumor evolution. Heterogeneous clones driven by distinct CNAs have different selective advantages, leading to differential patterns of tumor evolution that are essential for developing effective cancer therapies. Recent advances in single-cell sequencing technology have enabled genome-wide copy number profiling of tumor cell populations at single-cell resolution. This has made it possible to explore the evolutionary patterns of CNAs and accurately discover the mechanisms of intra-tumor heterogeneity. Here, we propose a two-step statistical approach that distinguishes neutral, linear, branching and punctuated evolutionary patterns for a tumor cell population based on single-cell copy number profiles. We assessed our approach using a variety of simulated and real single-cell genomic and transcriptomic datasets, demonstrating its high accuracy and robustness in predicting tumor evolutionary patterns. We applied our approach to single-cell DNA sequencing data from 20 breast cancer patients and observed that punctuated evolution is the dominant evolutionary pattern in breast cancer. Similar conclusions were drawn when applying the approach to single-cell RNA sequencing data obtained from 132 various cancer patients. Moreover, we found that differential immune cell infiltration is associated with specific evolutionary patterns. The source code of our study is available at https://github.com/FangWang-SYSU/PTEM.
34665808	2021	PLoS computational biology	RgCop-A regularized copula based method for gene selection in single-cell RNA-seq data.	Gene selection in unannotated large single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data is important and crucial step in the preliminary step of downstream analysis. The existing approaches are primarily based on high variation (highly variable genes) or significant high expression (highly expressed genes) failed to provide stable and predictive feature set due to technical noise present in the data. Here, we propose RgCop, a novel regularized copula based method for gene selection from large single cell RNA-seq data. RgCop utilizes copula correlation (Ccor), a robust equitable dependence measure that captures multivariate dependency among a set of genes in single cell expression data. We formulate an objective function by adding l1 regularization term with Ccor to penalizes the redundant co-efficient of features/genes, resulting non-redundant effective features/genes set. Results show a significant improvement in the clustering/classification performance of real life scRNA-seq data over the other state-of-the-art. RgCop performs extremely well in capturing dependence among the features of noisy data due to the scale invariant property of copula, thereby improving the stability of the method. Moreover, the differentially expressed (DE) genes identified from the clusters of scRNA-seq data are found to provide an accurate annotation of cells. Finally, the features/genes obtained from RgCop is able to annotate the unknown cells with high accuracy.
27230763	2016	Genome biology	Fast and accurate single-cell RNA-seq analysis by clustering of transcript-compatibility counts.	Current approaches to single-cell transcriptomic analysis are computationally intensive and require assay-specific modeling, which limits their scope and generality. We propose a novel method that compares and clusters cells based on their transcript-compatibility read counts rather than on the transcript or gene quantifications used in standard analysis pipelines. In the reanalysis of two landmark yet disparate single-cell RNA-seq datasets, we show that our method is up to two orders of magnitude faster than previous approaches, provides accurate and in some cases improved results, and is directly applicable to data from a wide variety of assays.
39541187	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Identifying cell types by lasso-constraint regularized Gaussian graphical model based on weighted distance penalty.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology is one of the most cost-effective and efficacious methods for revealing cellular heterogeneity and diversity. Precise identification of cell types is essential for establishing a robust foundation for downstream analyses and is a prerequisite for understanding heterogeneous mechanisms. However, the accuracy of existing methods warrants improvement, and highly accurate methods often impose stringent equipment requirements. Moreover, most unsupervised learning-based approaches are constrained by the need to input the number of cell types a prior, which limits their widespread application. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm framework named WLGG. Initially, to capture the underlying nonlinear information, we introduce a weighted distance penalty term utilizing the Gaussian kernel function, which maps data from a low-dimensional nonlinear space to a high-dimensional linear space. We subsequently impose a Lasso constraint on the regularized Gaussian graphical model to enhance its ability to capture linear data characteristics. Additionally, we utilize the Eigengap strategy to predict the number of cell types and obtain predicted labels via spectral clustering. The experimental results on 14 test datasets demonstrate the superior clustering accuracy of the WLGG algorithm over 16 alternative methods. Furthermore, downstream analysis, including marker gene identification, pseudotime inference, and functional enrichment analysis based on the similarity matrix and predicted labels from the WLGG algorithm, substantiates the reliability of WLGG and offers valuable insights into biological dynamic biological processes and regulatory mechanisms.
34003861	2021	PLoS computational biology	G2S3: A gene graph-based imputation method for single-cell RNA sequencing data.	Single-cell RNA sequencing technology provides an opportunity to study gene expression at single-cell resolution. However, prevalent dropout events result in high data sparsity and noise that may obscure downstream analyses in single-cell transcriptomic studies. We propose a new method, G2S3, that imputes dropouts by borrowing information from adjacent genes in a sparse gene graph learned from gene expression profiles across cells. We applied G2S3 and ten existing imputation methods to eight single-cell transcriptomic datasets and compared their performance. Our results demonstrated that G2S3 has superior overall performance in recovering gene expression, identifying cell subtypes, reconstructing cell trajectories, identifying differentially expressed genes, and recovering gene regulatory and correlation relationships. Moreover, G2S3 is computationally efficient for imputation in large-scale single-cell transcriptomic datasets.

Here we demonstrate that the large language model GPT-4 can accurately annotate cell types using marker gene information in single-cell RNA sequencing analysis. When evaluated across hundreds of tissue and cell types, GPT-4 generates cell type annotations exhibiting strong concordance with manual annotations. This capability can considerably reduce the effort and expertise required for cell type annotation. Additionally, we have developed an R software package GPTCelltype for GPT-4's automated cell type annotation.

37004161	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	STGRNS: an interpretable transformer-based method for inferring gene regulatory networks from single-cell transcriptomic data.	"MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies provide an opportunity to infer cell-specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs), which is an important challenge in systems biology. Although numerous methods have been developed for inferring GRNs from scRNA-seq data, it is still a challenge to deal with cellular heterogeneity. RESULTS: To address this challenge, we developed an interpretable transformer-based method namely STGRNS for inferring GRNs from scRNA-seq data. In this algorithm, gene expression motif technique was proposed to convert gene pairs into contiguous sub-vectors, which can be used as input for the transformer encoder. By avoiding missing phase-specific regulations in a network, gene expression motif can improve the accuracy of GRN inference for different types of scRNA-seq data. To assess the performance of STGRNS, we implemented the comparative experiments with some popular methods on extensive benchmark datasets including 21 static and 27 time-series scRNA-seq dataset. All the results show that STGRNS is superior to other comparative methods. In addition, STGRNS was also proved to be more interpretable than ""black box"" deep learning methods, which are well-known for the difficulty to explain the predictions clearly. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code and data are available at https://github.com/zhanglab-wbgcas/STGRNS."

37950331	2023	Genome biology	Evaluation of deep learning-based feature selection for single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis.	BACKGROUND: Feature selection is an essential task in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data analysis and can be critical for gene dimension reduction and downstream analyses, such as gene marker identification and cell type classification. Most popular methods for feature selection from scRNA-seq data are based on the concept of differential distribution wherein a statistical model is used to detect changes in gene expression among cell types. Recent development of deep learning-based feature selection methods provides an alternative approach compared to traditional differential distribution-based methods in that the importance of a gene is determined by neural networks. RESULTS: In this work, we explore the utility of various deep learning-based feature selection methods for scRNA-seq data analysis. We sample from Tabula Muris and Tabula Sapiens atlases to create scRNA-seq datasets with a range of data properties and evaluate the performance of traditional and deep learning-based feature selection methods for cell type classification, feature selection reproducibility and diversity, and computational time. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a reference for future development and application of deep learning-based feature selection methods for single-cell omics data analyses.
27940562	2017	Nucleic acids research	A cost effective 5΄ selective single cell transcriptome profiling approach with improved UMI design.	Single cell RNA sequencing approaches are instrumental in studies of cell-to-cell variability. 5΄ selective transcriptome profiling approaches allow simultaneous definition of the transcription start size and have advantages over 3΄ selective approaches which just provide internal sequences close to the 3΄ end. The only currently existing 5΄ selective approach requires costly and labor intensive fragmentation and cell barcoding after cDNA amplification. We developed an optimized 5΄ selective workflow where all the cell indexing is done prior to fragmentation. With our protocol, cell indexing can be performed in the Fluidigm C1 microfluidic device, resulting in a significant reduction of cost and labor. We also designed optimized unique molecular identifiers that show less sequence bias and vulnerability towards sequencing errors resulting in an improved accuracy of molecule counting. We provide comprehensive experimental workflows for Illumina and Ion Proton sequencers that allow single cell sequencing in a cost range comparable to qPCR assays.

Compared with current methods, CLEAR overcomes the heterogeneity of the experimental data with a specifically designed representation learning task and thus can handle batch effects and dropout events simultaneously. It achieves superior performance on a broad range of fundamental tasks, including clustering, visualization, dropout correction, batch effect removal, and pseudo-time inference. The proposed method successfully identifies and illustrates inflammatory-related mechanisms in a COVID-19 disease study with 43 695 single cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

35771600	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	ResPAN: a powerful batch correction model for scRNA-seq data through residual adversarial networks.	MOTIVATION: With the advancement of technology, we can generate and access large-scale, high dimensional and diverse genomics data, especially through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). However, integrative downstream analysis from multiple scRNA-seq datasets remains challenging due to batch effects. RESULTS: In this article, we propose a light-structured deep learning framework called ResPAN for scRNA-seq data integration. ResPAN is based on Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) combined with random walk mutual nearest neighbor pairing and fully skip-connected autoencoders to reduce the differences among batches.

29752298	2018	Genome research	Single-cell RNA-seq of human induced pluripotent stem cells reveals cellular heterogeneity and cell state transitions between subpopulations.	Heterogeneity of cell states represented in pluripotent cultures has not been described at the transcriptional level. Since gene expression is highly heterogeneous between cells, single-cell RNA sequencing can be used to identify how individual pluripotent cells function. Here, we present results from the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data from 18,787 individual WTC-CRISPRi human induced pluripotent stem cells. We developed an unsupervised clustering method and, through this, identified four subpopulations distinguishable on the basis of their pluripotent state, including a core pluripotent population (48.3%), proliferative (47.8%), early primed for differentiation (2.8%), and late primed for differentiation (1.1%). For each subpopulation, we were able to identify the genes and pathways that define differences in pluripotent cell states. Our method identified four transcriptionally distinct predictor gene sets composed of 165 unique genes that denote the specific pluripotency states; using these sets, we developed a multigenic machine learning prediction method to accurately classify single cells into each of the subpopulations. Compared against a set of established pluripotency markers, our method increases prediction accuracy by 10%, specificity by 20%, and explains a substantially larger proportion of deviance (up to threefold) from the prediction model. Finally, we developed an innovative method to predict cells transitioning between subpopulations and support our conclusions with results from two orthogonal pseudotime trajectory methods.
33077959	2021	Nature biotechnology	RNA timestamps identify the age of single molecules in RNA sequencing.	Current approaches to single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) provide only limited information about the dynamics of gene expression. Here we present RNA timestamps, a method for inferring the age of individual RNAs in RNA-seq data by exploiting RNA editing. To introduce timestamps, we tag RNA with a reporter motif consisting of multiple MS2 binding sites that recruit the adenosine deaminase ADAR2 fused to an MS2 capsid protein. ADAR2 binding to tagged RNA causes A-to-I edits to accumulate over time, allowing the age of the RNA to be inferred with hour-scale accuracy. By combining observations of multiple timestamped RNAs driven by the same promoter, we can determine when the promoter was active. We demonstrate that the system can infer the presence and timing of multiple past transcriptional events. Finally, we apply the method to cluster single cells according to the timing of past transcriptional activity. RNA timestamps will allow the incorporation of temporal information into RNA-seq workflows.

40471707	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Between Cluster Analysis: Supervised Dimensionality Reduction for Trajectory Inference.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) measures the transcriptional state of individual cells, enabling more precise characterization of cell types, cell states, and developmental trajectories. Because of the high dimensionality of scRNA-seq data, a standard first step in scRNA-seq analysis is to perform dimensionality reduction. PCA and many other commonly used dimensionality reduction techniques are unsupervised, meaning that they do not incorporate any prior knowledge of the data being analyzed. On the other hand, nearly all trajectory inference methods are supervised, relying on information such as a clustering of cells into cell types/states. RESULTS: We introduce Between Cluster Analysis (BCA), a supervised linear dimensionality reduction technique that uses cluster labels of cells as prior information and computes an embedding that maximizes the between cluster variance. We show on both simulated and real data that BCA improves trajectory inference compared to other dimensionality reduction methods, including Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), another supervised linear dimensionality reduction method. Additionally, we observe that many of the commonly used metrics to evaluate trajectory inference evaluate only the ordering of cell types and not the identification or ordering of intermediate cell states. We propose an alternative measure to evaluate trajectory inference methods in preserving intermediate cells, especially when the ordering of these intermediate cells is unknown.

39851073	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	scMMAE: masked cross-attention network for single-cell multimodal omics fusion to enhance unimodal omics.	Multimodal omics provide deeper insight into the biological processes and cellular functions, especially transcriptomics and proteomics. Computational methods have been proposed for the integration of single-cell multimodal omics of transcriptomics and proteomics. However, existing methods primarily concentrate on the alignment of different omics, overlooking the unique information inherent in each omics type. Moreover, as the majority of single-cell cohorts only encompass one omics, it becomes critical to transfer the knowledge learnt from multimodal omics to enhance unimodal omics analysis. Therefore, we proposed a novel framework that leverages masked autoencoder with cross-attention mechanism, called scMMAE (single-cell multimodal masked autoencoder), to fuse multimodal omics and enhance unimodal omics analysis. scMMAE simultaneously captures both the shared features and the distinctive information of two single-cell omics modalities and transfers the knowledge to enhance single-cell transcriptome data. Comparative evaluations against benchmarking methods across various cohorts revealed a notable improvement, with an increase of up to 21% in the adjusted Rand index and up to 12% in normalized mutual information in the context of multimodal fusion. In the realm of unimodal omics, scMMAE demonstrated an overall enhancement of approximately 20% in the adjusted Rand index and nearly 10% in normalized mutual information. Other nine metrics, including the Fowlkes-Mallows index and silhouette coefficient, further underscored the high performance of scMMAE. Significantly, scMMAE exhibits an elevated level of proficiency in distinguishing between different cell types, particularly on CD4 and CD8 T cells. Availability and implementation: scMMAE source code at https://github.com/DM0815/scMMAE/.
35879727	2022	Genome biology	ZetaSuite: computational analysis of two-dimensional high-throughput data from multi-target screens and single-cell transcriptomics.	Two-dimensional high-throughput data have become increasingly common in functional genomics studies, which raises new challenges in data analysis. Here, we introduce a new statistic called Zeta, initially developed to identify global splicing regulators from a two-dimensional RNAi screen, a high-throughput screen coupled with high-throughput functional readouts, and ZetaSuite, a software package to facilitate general application of the Zeta statistics. We compare our approach with existing methods using multiple benchmarked datasets and then demonstrate the broad utility of ZetaSuite in processing public data from large-scale cancer dependency screens and single-cell transcriptomics studies to elucidate novel biological insights.
36214642	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	CAMML with the Integration of Marker Proteins (ChIMP).	MOTIVATION: Cell typing is a critical task in the analysis of single-cell data, particularly when studying complex diseased tissues. Unfortunately, the sparsity and noise of single-cell data make accurate cell typing of individual cells difficult. To address these challenges, we previously developed the CAMML method for multi-label cell typing of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. CAMML uses weighted gene sets to score each profiled cell for multiple potential cell types. While CAMML outperforms other scRNA-seq cell typing techniques, it only leverages transcriptomic data so cannot take advantage of newer multi-omic single-cell assays that jointly profile gene expression and protein abundance (e.g. joint scRNA-seq/CITE-seq). RESULTS: We developed the CAMML with the Integration of Marker Proteins (ChIMP) method to support multi-label cell typing of individual cells jointly profiled via scRNA-seq and CITE-seq. ChIMP combines cell type scores computed on scRNA-seq data via the CAMML approach with discretized CITE-seq measurements for cell type marker proteins. The multi-omic cell type scores generated by ChIMP allow researchers to more precisely and conservatively cell type joint scRNA-seq/CITE-seq data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: An implementation of this work is available on CRAN at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CAMML/.

36583343	2023	Nucleic acids research	Genome-wide inference reveals that feedback regulations constrain promoter-dependent transcriptional burst kinetics.	Gene expression in mammalian cells is highly variable and episodic, resulting in a series of discontinuous bursts of mRNAs. A challenge is to understand how static promoter architecture and dynamic feedback regulations dictate bursting on a genome-wide scale. Although single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides an opportunity to address this challenge, effective analytical methods are scarce. We developed an interpretable and scalable inference framework, which combined experimental data with a mechanistic model to infer transcriptional burst kinetics (sizes and frequencies) and feedback regulations. Applying this framework to scRNA-seq data generated from embryonic mouse fibroblast cells, we found Simpson's paradoxes, i.e. genome-wide burst kinetics exhibit different characteristics in two cases without and with distinguishing feedback regulations. We also showed that feedbacks differently modulate burst frequencies and sizes and conceal the effects of transcription start site distributions on burst kinetics. Notably, only in the presence of positive feedback, TATA genes are expressed with high burst frequencies and enhancer-promoter interactions mainly modulate burst frequencies. The developed inference method provided a flexible and efficient way to investigate transcriptional burst kinetics and the obtained results would be helpful for understanding cell development and fate decision.
35696651	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	Entropy-based inference of transition states and cellular trajectory for single-cell transcriptomics.	The development of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) technology allows researchers to characterize the cell types, states and transitions during dynamic biological processes at single-cell resolution. One of the critical tasks is to infer pseudo-time trajectory. However, the existence of transition cells in the intermediate state of complex biological processes poses a challenge for the trajectory inference. Here, we propose a new single-cell trajectory inference method based on transition entropy, named scTite, to identify transitional states and reconstruct cell trajectory from scRNA-seq data. Taking into account the continuity of cellular processes, we introduce a new metric called transition entropy to measure the uncertainty of a cell belonging to different cell clusters, and then identify cell states and transition cells. Specifically, we adopt different strategies to infer the trajectory for the identified cell states and transition cells, and combine them to obtain a detailed cell trajectory. For the identified cell clusters, we utilize the Wasserstein distance based on the probability distribution to calculate distance between clusters, and construct the minimum spanning tree. Meanwhile, we adopt the signaling entropy and partial correlation coefficient to determine transition paths, which contain a group of transition cells with the largest similarity. Then the transitional paths and the MST are combined to infer a refined cell trajectory. We apply scTite to four real scRNA-seq datasets and an integrated dataset, and conduct extensive performance comparison with nine existing trajectory inference methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can reconstruct the cell trajectory more accurately than the compared algorithms. The scTite software package is available at https://github.com/dblab2022/scTite.
32207520	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Automatic identification of relevant genes from low-dimensional embeddings of single-cell RNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: Dimensionality reduction is a key step in the analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data. It produces a low-dimensional embedding for visualization and as a calculation base for downstream analysis. Nonlinear techniques are most suitable to handle the intrinsic complexity of large, heterogeneous single-cell data. However, with no linear relation between gene and embedding coordinate, there is no way to extract the identity of genes driving any cell's position in the low-dimensional embedding, making it difficult to characterize the underlying biological processes. RESULTS: In this article, we introduce the concepts of local and global gene relevance to compute an equivalent of principal component analysis loadings for non-linear low-dimensional embeddings. Global gene relevance identifies drivers of the overall embedding, while local gene relevance identifies those of a defined sub-region. We apply our method to single-cell RNA-seq datasets from different experimental protocols and to different low-dimensional embedding techniques. This shows our method's versatility to identify key genes for a variety of biological processes. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: To ensure reproducibility and ease of use, our method is released as part of destiny 3.0, a popular R package for building diffusion maps from single-cell transcriptomic data. It is readily available through Bioconductor. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
41159730	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Single-cell multi-omics and machine learning for dissecting stemness in cancer.	Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a subpopulation of tumor cells with self-renewal capacity and the ability to drive tumor growth, metastasis, and relapse. They are widely recognized as major contributors to therapeutic resistance. Despite extensive efforts to characterize and target CSCs, their elusive nature continues to drive therapeutic resistance and relapse in epithelial malignancies. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has transformed our understanding of tumor biology. It enables high-resolution profiling of rare subpopulations (<5%) and reveals the functional heterogeneity that contributes to treatment failure. In this review, we discuss evolving evidence for a paradigm shift, enabled by rapidly advancing single-cell technologies, from a static, marker-based definition of CSCs to a dynamic and functional perspective. We explore how trajectory inference and spatial transcriptomics redefine stemness by context-dependent dynamic-state modelling. We also highlight emerging platforms, including artificial intelligence-driven predictive modelling, multi-omics integration, and functional CRISPR screens. These approaches have the potential to uncover new vulnerabilities in CSC populations. Together, these advances should lead to new precision medicine strategies for disrupting CSC plasticity, niche adaptation, and immune evasion.
31740815	2020	Nature methods	Probabilistic cell typing enables fine mapping of closely related cell types in situ.	Understanding the function of a tissue requires knowing the spatial organization of its constituent cell types. In the cerebral cortex, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revealed the genome-wide expression patterns that define its many, closely related neuronal types, but cannot reveal their spatial arrangement. Here we introduce probabilistic cell typing by in situ sequencing (pciSeq), an approach that leverages previous scRNA-seq classification to identify cell types using multiplexed in situ RNA detection. We applied this method by mapping the inhibitory neurons of mouse hippocampal area CA1, for which ground truth is available from extensive previous work identifying their laminar organization. Our method identified these neuronal classes in a spatial arrangement matching ground truth, and further identified multiple classes of isocortical pyramidal cell in a pattern matching their known organization. This method will allow identifying the spatial organization of closely related cell types across the brain and other tissues.
33711017	2021	PLoS computational biology	Detection of gene cis-regulatory element perturbations in single-cell transcriptomes.	We introduce poly-adenine CRISPR gRNA-based single-cell RNA-sequencing (pAC-Seq), a method that enables the direct observation of guide RNAs (gRNAs) in scRNA-seq. We use pAC-Seq to assess the phenotypic consequences of CRISPR/Cas9 based alterations of gene cis-regulatory regions. We show that pAC-Seq is able to detect cis-regulatory-induced alteration of target gene expression even when biallelic loss of target gene expression occurs in only ~5% of cells. This low rate of biallelic loss significantly increases the number of cells required to detect the consequences of changes to the regulatory genome, but can be ameliorated by transcript-targeted sequencing. Based on our experimental results we model the power to detect regulatory genome induced transcriptomic effects based on the rate of mono/biallelic loss, baseline gene expression, and the number of cells per target gRNA.
40973204	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Conformal inference for reliable single cell RNA-seq annotation.	MOTIVATION: Despite the inherent complexity associated to automatic cell type assignments, most supervised learning models overlook rigorous uncertainty quantification on the annotations. Although some existing pipelines incorporate rejection options under predefined circumstances, they usually rely on arbitrary assumptions and do not provide statistical guarantees. In this work, we propose a methodology based on the conformal prediction framework to provide reliable single-cell annotations. Conformal prediction provides statistical guarantees on the outcome predictions without making any assumption about the underlying distribution of the data. Our methodological proposal leverages conformal inference to address two critical challenges in single-cell RNA sequencing annotations: (i) detect out-of-distribution cell types in the query data; and, (ii) perform reliable uncertainty quantification of the cell annotations through well-calibrated prediction sets. RESULTS: We evaluated the anomaly detector and the uncertainty-aware annotator in 10 batched experiments derived from various tissues. Specifically, we studied three different annotation taxonomies (standard, classwise, and cluster) alongside three different non-conformity measures. The results showed that our anomaly detector effectively identified previously unseen cell types, producing well-calibrated prediction sets. This rigorous annotation helped maintain coverage probabilities at the expected significance level. Finally, we illustrate how the integration of conformal prediction outputs enhanced further downstream analyses. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The automatic scRNA-seq annotator is available at https://github.com/digital-medicine-research-group-UNAV/conformalized_single_cell_annotator and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15870599.
38098055	2023	Genome biology	Challenges and opportunities to computationally deconvolve heterogeneous tissue with varying cell sizes using single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets.	"Deconvolution of cell mixtures in ""bulk"" transcriptomic samples from homogenate human tissue is important for understanding disease pathologies. However, several experimental and computational challenges impede transcriptomics-based deconvolution approaches using single-cell/nucleus RNA-seq reference atlases. Cells from the brain and blood have substantially different sizes, total mRNA, and transcriptional activities, and existing approaches may quantify total mRNA instead of cell type proportions. Further, standards are lacking for the use of cell reference atlases and integrative analyses of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data. We discuss how to approach these key challenges with orthogonal ""gold standard"" datasets for evaluating deconvolution methods."
39177093	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	FateNet: an integration of dynamical systems and deep learning for cell fate prediction.	MOTIVATION: Understanding cellular decision-making, particularly its timing and impact on the biological system such as tissue health and function, is a fundamental challenge in biology and medicine. Existing methods for inferring fate decisions and cellular state dynamics from single-cell RNA sequencing data lack precision regarding decision points and broader tissue implications. Addressing this gap, we present FateNet, a computational approach integrating dynamical systems theory and deep learning to probe the cell decision-making process using scRNA-seq data. RESULTS: By leveraging information about normal forms and scaling behavior near bifurcations common to many dynamical systems, FateNet predicts cell decision occurrence with higher accuracy than conventional methods and offers qualitative insights into the new state of the biological system. Also, through in-silico perturbation experiments, FateNet identifies key genes and pathways governing the differentiation process in hematopoiesis. Validated using different scRNA-seq data, FateNet emerges as a user-friendly and valuable tool for predicting critical points in biological processes, providing insights into complex trajectories.

It sources and compiles data on the abundance and localisation of RNA and proteins in various biological systems and contexts and provides open access to this data for the research community. With the increased availability of single cell RNA-Seq datasets in the public archives, we have now extended Expression Atlas with a new added-value service to display gene expression in single cells. Single Cell Expression Atlas was launched in 2018 and currently includes 123 single cell RNA-Seq studies from 12 species. The website can be searched by genes within or across species to reveal experiments, tissues and cell types where this gene is expressed or under which conditions it is a marker gene. Within each study, cells can be visualized using a pre-calculated t-SNE plot and can be coloured by different features or by cell clusters based on gene expression. Within each experiment, there are links to downloadable files, such as RNA quantification matrices, clustering results, reports on protocols and associated metadata, such as assigned cell types.
31060596	2019	Genome biology	SCRABBLE: single-cell RNA-seq imputation constrained by bulk RNA-seq data.	Single-cell RNA-seq data contain a large proportion of zeros for expressed genes. Such dropout events present a fundamental challenge for various types of data analyses. Here, we describe the SCRABBLE algorithm to address this problem. SCRABBLE leverages bulk data as a constraint and reduces unwanted bias towards expressed genes during imputation. Using both simulation and several types of experimental data, we demonstrate that SCRABBLE outperforms the existing methods in recovering dropout events, capturing true distribution of gene expression across cells, and preserving gene-gene relationship and cell-cell relationship in the data.
40408513	2025	PLoS computational biology	M-band wavelet-based multi-view clustering of cells.	Wavelet analysis has been recognized as a widely used and promising tool in the fields of signal processing and data analysis. However, the application of wavelet-based method in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data is little known. Here, we present M-band wavelet-based scRNA-seq multi-view clustering of cells (WMC). We applied for integration of M-band wavelet analysis and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) to a panel of single cell sequencing datasets by breaking up the data matrix into an approximation or low resolution component and M-1 detail or high resolution components. Our method is armed with multi-view clustering of cell types, identity, and functional states, enabling missing cell types visualization and new cell types discovery. Distinct to standard scRNA-seq workflow, our wavelet-based approach is a new addition to uncover rare cell types with a fine resolution.
40258090	2025	PLoS computational biology	Transfer learning of multicellular organization via single-cell and spatial transcriptomics.	Biological tissues exhibit complex gene expression and multicellular patterns that are valuable to dissect. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides full coverages of genes, but lacks spatial information, whereas spatial transcriptomics (ST) measures spatial locations of individual or group of cells, with more restrictions on gene information. Here we show a transfer learning method named iSORT to decipher spatial organization of cells by integrating scRNA-seq and ST data. iSORT trains a neural network that maps gene expressions to spatial locations. iSORT can find spatial patterns at single-cell scale, identify spatial-organizing genes (SOGs) that drive the patterning, and infer pseudo-growth trajectories using a concept of SpaRNA velocity. Benchmarking on a range of biological systems, such as human cortex, mouse embryo, mouse brain, Drosophila embryo, and human developmental heart, demonstrates iSORT's accuracy and practicality in reconstructing multicellular organization. We further conducted scRNA-seq and ST sequencing from normal and atherosclerotic arteries, and the functional enrichment analysis shows that SOGs found by iSORT are strongly associated with vascular structural anomalies.
40708222	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	GRANet: a graph residual attention network for gene regulatory network inference.	The reconstruction of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is crucial for uncovering regulatory relationships between genes and understanding the mechanisms of gene expression within cells. With advancements in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology, researchers have sought to infer GRNs at the single-cell level. However, existing methods primarily construct global models encompassing entire gene networks. While these approaches aim to capture genome-wide interactions, they frequently suffer from decreased accuracy due to challenges such as network scale, noise interference, and data sparsity. This study proposes GRANet (Graph Residual Attention Network), a novel deep learning framework for inferring GRNs. GRANet leverages residual attention mechanisms to adaptively learn complex gene regulatory relationships while integrating multi-dimensional biological features for a more comprehensive inference process. We evaluated GRANet across multiple datasets, benchmarking its performance against state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate that GRANet consistently outperforms existing methods in GRN inference tasks. In addition, in our case study on EGR1, CBFB, and ELF1, GRANet achieved high prediction accuracy, effectively identifying both known and novel regulatory interactions. These findings highlight GRANet's potential to advance research in gene regulation and disease mechanisms.
36250784	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scGNN 2.0: a graph neural network tool for imputation and clustering of single-cell RNA-Seq data.	MOTIVATION: Gene expression imputation has been an essential step of the single-cell RNA-Seq data analysis workflow. Among several deep-learning methods, the debut of scGNN gained substantial recognition in 2021 for its superior performance and the ability to produce a cell-cell graph. However, the implementation of scGNN was relatively time-consuming and its performance could still be optimized. RESULTS: The implementation of scGNN 2.0 is significantly faster than scGNN thanks to a simplified close-loop architecture. For all eight datasets, cell clustering performance was increased by 85.02% on average in terms of adjusted rand index, and the imputation Median L1 Error was reduced by 67.94% on average. With the built-in visualizations, users can quickly assess the imputation and cell clustering results, compare against benchmarks and interpret the cell-cell interaction. The expanded input and output formats also pave the way for custom workflows that integrate scGNN 2.0 with other scRNA-Seq toolkits on both Python and R platforms. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: scGNN 2.0 is implemented in Python (as of version 3.8) with the source code available at https://github.com/OSU-BMBL/scGNN2.0. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
38622747	2024	Genome biology	Powerful and accurate detection of temporal gene expression patterns from multi-sample multi-stage single-cell transcriptomics data with TDEseq.	We present a non-parametric statistical method called TDEseq that takes full advantage of smoothing splines basis functions to account for the dependence of multiple time points in scRNA-seq studies, and uses hierarchical structure linear additive mixed models to model the correlated cells within an individual. As a result, TDEseq demonstrates powerful performance in identifying four potential temporal expression patterns within a specific cell type. Extensive simulation studies and the analysis of four published scRNA-seq datasets show that TDEseq can produce well-calibrated p-values and up to 20% power gain over the existing methods for detecting temporal gene expression patterns.
28459448	2017	Nature biotechnology	Single-cell topological RNA-seq analysis reveals insights into cellular differentiation and development.	Transcriptional programs control cellular lineage commitment and differentiation during development. Understanding of cell fate has been advanced by studying single-cell RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) but is limited by the assumptions of current analytic methods regarding the structure of data. We present single-cell topological data analysis (scTDA), an algorithm for topology-based computational analyses to study temporal, unbiased transcriptional regulation. Unlike other methods, scTDA is a nonlinear, model-independent, unsupervised statistical framework that can characterize transient cellular states. We applied scTDA to the analysis of murine embryonic stem cell (mESC) differentiation in vitro in response to inducers of motor neuron differentiation. scTDA resolved asynchrony and continuity in cellular identity over time and identified four transient states (pluripotent, precursor, progenitor, and fully differentiated cells) based on changes in stage-dependent combinations of transcription factors, RNA-binding proteins, and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). scTDA can be applied to study asynchronous cellular responses to either developmental cues or environmental perturbations.
37779245	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	ScSmOP: a universal computational pipeline for single-cell single-molecule multiomics data analysis.	Single-cell multiomics techniques have been widely applied to detect the key signature of cells. These methods have achieved a single-molecule resolution and can even reveal spatial localization. These emerging methods provide insights elucidating the features of genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic heterogeneity in individual cells. However, they have given rise to new computational challenges in data processing. Here, we describe Single-cell Single-molecule multiple Omics Pipeline (ScSmOP), a universal pipeline for barcode-indexed single-cell single-molecule multiomics data analysis. Essentially, the C language is utilized in ScSmOP to set up spaced-seed hash table-based algorithms for barcode identification according to ligation-based barcoding data and synthesis-based barcoding data, followed by data mapping and deconvolution. We demonstrate high reproducibility of data processing between ScSmOP and published pipelines in comprehensive analyses of single-cell omics data (scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, scARC-seq), single-molecule chromatin interaction data (ChIA-Drop, SPRITE, RD-SPRITE), single-cell single-molecule chromatin interaction data (scSPRITE) and spatial transcriptomic data from various cell types and species. Additionally, ScSmOP shows more rapid performance and is a versatile, efficient, easy-to-use and robust pipeline for single-cell single-molecule multiomics data analysis.
26430063	2015	Genome research	Single-cell RNA-seq reveals changes in cell cycle and differentiation programs upon aging of hematopoietic stem cells.	Both intrinsic cell state changes and variations in the composition of stem cell populations have been implicated as contributors to aging. We used single-cell RNA-seq to dissect variability in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) and hematopoietic progenitor cell populations from young and old mice from two strains. We found that cell cycle dominates the variability within each population and that there is a lower frequency of cells in the G1 phase among old compared with young long-term HSCs, suggesting that they traverse through G1 faster. Moreover, transcriptional changes in HSCs during aging are inversely related to those upon HSC differentiation, such that old short-term (ST) HSCs resemble young long-term (LT-HSCs), suggesting that they exist in a less differentiated state. Our results indicate both compositional changes and intrinsic, population-wide changes with age and are consistent with a model where a relationship between cell cycle progression and self-renewal versus differentiation of HSCs is affected by aging and may contribute to the functional decline of old HSCs.
35255944	2022	Genome biology	TraSig: inferring cell-cell interactions from pseudotime ordering of scRNA-Seq data.	A major advantage of single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data is the ability to reconstruct continuous ordering and trajectories for cells. Here we present TraSig, a computational method for improving the inference of cell-cell interactions in scRNA-Seq studies that utilizes the dynamic information to identify significant ligand-receptor pairs with similar trajectories, which in turn are used to score interacting cell clusters. We applied TraSig to several scRNA-Seq datasets and obtained unique predictions that improve upon those identified by prior methods. Functional experiments validate the ability of TraSig to identify novel signaling interactions that impact vascular development in liver organoids.Software https://github.com/doraadong/TraSig .
36280722	2022	Nature methods	Geometric engineering of organoid culture for enhanced organogenesis in a dish.	Here, we introduce a facile, scalable engineering approach to enable long-term development and maturation of organoids. We have redesigned the configuration of conventional organoid culture to develop a platform that converts single injections of stem cell suspensions to radial arrays of organoids that can be maintained for extended periods without the need for passaging. Using this system, we demonstrate accelerated production of intestinal organoids with significantly enhanced structural and functional maturity, and their continuous development for over 4 weeks. Furthermore, we present a patient-derived organoid model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and its interrogation using single-cell RNA sequencing to demonstrate its ability to reproduce key pathological features of IBD. Finally, we describe the extension of our approach to engineer vascularized, perfusable human enteroids, which can be used to model innate immune responses in IBD. This work provides an immediately deployable platform technology toward engineering more realistic organ-like structures in a dish.
35440087	2022	Genome biology	Metacell-2: a divide-and-conquer metacell algorithm for scalable scRNA-seq analysis.	Scaling scRNA-seq to profile millions of cells is crucial for constructing high-resolution maps of transcriptional manifolds. Current analysis strategies, in particular dimensionality reduction and two-phase clustering, offer only limited scaling and sensitivity to define such manifolds. We introduce Metacell-2, a recursive divide-and-conquer algorithm allowing efficient decomposition of scRNA-seq datasets of any size into small and cohesive groups of cells called metacells. Metacell-2 improves outlier cell detection and rare cell type identification, as shown with human bone marrow cell atlas and mouse embryonic data. Metacell-2 is implemented over the scanpy framework for easy integration in any analysis pipeline.
32831127	2020	Genome biology	Tuning parameters of dimensionality reduction methods for single-cell RNA-seq analysis.	BACKGROUND: Many computational methods have been developed recently to analyze single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data. Several benchmark studies have compared these methods on their ability for dimensionality reduction, clustering, or differential analysis, often relying on default parameters. Yet, given the biological diversity of scRNA-seq datasets, parameter tuning might be essential for the optimal usage of methods, and determining how to tune parameters remains an unmet need. RESULTS: Here, we propose a benchmark to assess the performance of five methods, systematically varying their tunable parameters, for dimension reduction of scRNA-seq data, a common first step to many downstream applications such as cell type identification or trajectory inference. We run a total of 1.5 million experiments to assess the influence of parameter changes on the performance of each method, and propose two strategies to automatically tune parameters for methods that need it. CONCLUSIONS: We find that principal component analysis (PCA)-based methods like scran and Seurat are competitive with default parameters but do not benefit much from parameter tuning, while more complex models like ZinbWave, DCA, and scVI can reach better performance but after parameter tuning.
38493343	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Benchmarking multi-omics integration algorithms across single-cell RNA and ATAC data.	Recent advancements in single-cell sequencing technologies have generated extensive omics data in various modalities and revolutionized cell research, especially in the single-cell RNA and ATAC data. The joint analysis across scRNA-seq data and scATAC-seq data has paved the way to comprehending the cellular heterogeneity and complex cellular regulatory networks. Multi-omics integration is gaining attention as an important step in joint analysis, and the number of computational tools in this field is growing rapidly. In this paper, we benchmarked 12 multi-omics integration methods on three integration tasks via qualitative visualization and quantitative metrics, considering six main aspects that matter in multi-omics data analysis. Overall, we found that different methods have their own advantages on different aspects, while some methods outperformed other methods in most aspects. We therefore provided guidelines for selecting appropriate methods for specific scenarios and tasks to help obtain meaningful insights from multi-omics data integration.
33822877	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	Deep embedded clustering with multiple objectives on scRNA-seq data.	In recent years, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have been widely adopted to interrogate gene expression of individual cells; it brings opportunities to understand the underlying processes in a high-throughput manner. Deep embedded clustering (DEC) was demonstrated successful in high-dimensional sparse scRNA-seq data by joint feature learning and cluster assignment for identifying cell types simultaneously. However, the deep network architecture for embedding clustering is not trivial to optimize. Therefore, we propose an evolutionary multiobjective DEC by synergizing the multiobjective evolutionary optimization to simultaneously evolve the hyperparameters and architectures of DEC in an automatic manner. Firstly, a denoising autoencoder is integrated into the DEC to project the high-dimensional sparse scRNA-seq data into a low-dimensional space. After that, to guide the evolution, three objective functions are formulated to balance the model's generality and clustering performance for robustness. Meanwhile, migration and mutation operators are proposed to optimize the objective functions to select the suitable hyperparameters and architectures of DEC in the multiobjective framework. Multiple comparison analyses are conducted on twenty synthetic data and eight real data from different representative single-cell sequencing platforms to validate the effectiveness. The experimental results reveal that the proposed algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art clustering methods under different metrics. Meanwhile, marker genes identification, gene ontology enrichment and pathology analysis are conducted to reveal novel insights into the cell type identification and characterization mechanisms.
34389661	2021	Genome research	A single-cell atlas reveals unanticipated cell type complexity in Drosophila ovaries.	Organ function relies on the spatial organization and functional coordination of numerous cell types. The Drosophila ovary is a widely used model system to study the cellular activities underlying organ function, including stem cell regulation, cell signaling and epithelial morphogenesis. However, the relative paucity of cell type-specific reagents hinders investigation of molecular functions at the appropriate cellular resolution. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize all cell types of the stem cell compartment and early follicles of the Drosophila ovary. We computed transcriptional signatures and identified specific markers for nine states of germ cell differentiation and 23 somatic cell types and subtypes. We uncovered an unanticipated diversity of escort cells, the somatic cells that directly interact with differentiating germline cysts. Three escort cell subtypes reside in discrete anatomical positions and express distinct sets of secreted and transmembrane proteins, suggesting that diverse micro-environments support the progressive differentiation of germ cells. Finally, we identified 17 follicle cell subtypes and characterized their transcriptional profiles. Altogether, we provide a comprehensive resource of gene expression, cell type-specific markers, spatial coordinates, and functional predictions for 34 ovarian cell types and subtypes.
39960893	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	GCLink: a graph contrastive link prediction framework for gene regulatory network inference.	MOTIVATION: Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) unveil the intricate interactions among genes, pivotal in elucidating the complex biological processes within cells. The advent of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables the inference of GRNs at single-cell resolution. However, the majority of current supervised network inference methods typically concentrate on predicting pairwise gene regulatory interaction, thus failing to fully exploit correlations among all genes and exhibiting limited generalization performance. RESULTS: To address these issues, we propose a graph contrastive link prediction (GCLink) model to infer potential gene regulatory interactions from scRNA-seq data. Based on known gene regulatory interactions and scRNA-seq data, GCLink introduces a graph contrastive learning strategy to aggregate the feature and neighborhood information of genes to learn their representations. This approach reduces the dependence of our model on sample size and enhance its ability in predicting potential gene regulatory interactions. Extensive experiments on real scRNA-seq datasets demonstrate that GCLink outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in most cases. Furthermore, by pretraining GCLink on a source cell line with abundant known regulatory interactions and fine-tuning it on a target cell line with limited amount of known interactions, our GCLink model exhibits good performance in GRN inference, demonstrating its effectiveness in inferring GRNs from datasets with limited known interactions. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code and data are available at https://github.com/Yoyiming/GCLink.
32293520	2020	Genome biology	Obstacles to detecting isoforms using full-length scRNA-seq data.	BACKGROUND: Early single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) studies suggested that it was unusual to see more than one isoform being produced from a gene in a single cell, even when multiple isoforms were detected in matched bulk RNA-seq samples. However, these studies generally did not consider the impact of dropouts or isoform quantification errors, potentially confounding the results of these analyses. RESULTS: In this study, we take a simulation based approach in which we explicitly account for dropouts and isoform quantification errors. We use our simulations to ask to what extent it is possible to study alternative splicing using scRNA-seq. Additionally, we ask what limitations must be overcome to make splicing analysis feasible. We find that the high rate of dropouts associated with scRNA-seq is a major obstacle to studying alternative splicing. In mice and other well-established model organisms, the relatively low rate of isoform quantification errors poses a lesser obstacle to splicing analysis. We find that different models of isoform choice meaningfully change our simulation results. CONCLUSIONS: To accurately study alternative splicing with single-cell RNA-seq, a better understanding of isoform choice and the errors associated with scRNA-seq is required. An increase in the capture efficiency of scRNA-seq would also be beneficial. Until some or all of the above are achieved, we do not recommend attempting to resolve isoforms in individual cells using scRNA-seq.
34433466	2021	Genome biology	Sfaira accelerates data and model reuse in single cell genomics.	Single-cell RNA-seq datasets are often first analyzed independently without harnessing model fits from previous studies, and are then contextualized with public data sets, requiring time-consuming data wrangling. We address these issues with sfaira, a single-cell data zoo for public data sets paired with a model zoo for executable pre-trained models. The data zoo is designed to facilitate contribution of data sets using ontologies for metadata. We propose an adaption of cross-entropy loss for cell type classification tailored to datasets annotated at different levels of coarseness. We demonstrate the utility of sfaira by training models across anatomic data partitions on 8 million cells.
33792651	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Fast identification of differential distributions in single-cell RNA-sequencing data with waddR.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell gene expression distributions measured by single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) often display complex differences between samples. These differences are biologically meaningful but cannot be identified using standard methods for differential expression. RESULTS: Here, we derive and implement a flexible and fast differential distribution testing procedure based on the 2-Wasserstein distance. Our method is able to detect any type of difference in distribution between conditions. To interpret distributional differences, we decompose the 2-Wasserstein distance into terms that capture the relative contribution of changes in mean, variance and shape to the overall difference. Finally, we derive mathematical generalizations that allow our method to be used in a broad range of disciplines other than scRNA-seq or bioinformatics. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Our methods are implemented in the R/Bioconductor package waddR, which is freely available at https://github.com/goncalves-lab/waddR, along with documentation and examples. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
31598633	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	SPARSim single cell: a count data simulator for scRNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) count data show many differences compared with bulk RNA-seq count data, making the application of many RNA-seq pre-processing/analysis methods not straightforward or even inappropriate. For this reason, the development of new methods for handling scRNA-seq count data is currently one of the most active research fields in bioinformatics. To help the development of such new methods, the availability of simulated data could play a pivotal role. However, only few scRNA-seq count data simulators are available, often showing poor or not demonstrated similarity with real data. RESULTS: In this article we present SPARSim, a scRNA-seq count data simulator based on a Gamma-Multivariate Hypergeometric model. We demonstrate that SPARSim allows to generate count data that resemble real data in terms of count intensity, variability and sparsity, performing comparably or better than one of the most used scRNA-seq simulator, Splat. In particular, SPARSim simulated count matrices well resemble the distribution of zeros across different expression intensities observed in real count data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: SPARSim R package is freely available at http://sysbiobig.dei.unipd.it/? q=SPARSim and at https://gitlab.com/sysbiobig/sparsim.

39348410	2024	PLoS computational biology	BootCellNet, a resampling-based procedure, promotes unsupervised identification of cell populations via robust inference of gene regulatory networks.	Recent advances in measurement technologies, particularly single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), have revolutionized our ability to acquire large amounts of omics-level data on cellular states. As measurement techniques evolve, there has been an increasing need for data analysis methodologies, especially those focused on cell-type identification and inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs). We have developed a new method named BootCellNet, which employs smoothing and resampling to infer GRNs. Using the inferred GRNs, BootCellNet further infers the minimum dominating set (MDS), a set of genes that determines the dynamics of the entire network. We have demonstrated that BootCellNet robustly infers GRNs and their MDSs from scRNA-seq data and facilitates unsupervised identification of cell clusters using scRNA-seq datasets of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and hematopoiesis. It has also identified COVID-19 patient-specific cells and their potential regulatory transcription factors. BootCellNet not only identifies cell types in an unsupervised and explainable way but also provides insights into the characteristics of identified cell types through the inference of GRNs and MDS.
32058565	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	GeneSwitches: ordering gene expression and functional events in single-cell experiments.	SUMMARY: Emerging single-cell RNA-sequencing data technologies has made it possible to capture and assess the gene expression of individual cells. Based on the similarity of gene expression profiles, many tools have been developed to generate an in silico ordering of cells in the form of pseudo-time trajectories. However, these tools do not provide a means to find the ordering of critical gene expression changes over pseudo-time. We present GeneSwitches, a tool that takes any single-cell pseudo-time trajectory and determines the precise order of gene expression and functional-event changes over time. GeneSwitches uses a statistical framework based on logistic regression to identify the order in which genes are either switched on or off along pseudo-time. With this information, users can identify the order in which surface markers appear, investigate how functional ontologies are gained or lost over time and compare the ordering of switching genes from two related pseudo-temporal processes. AVAILABILITY: GeneSwitches is available at https://geneswitches.ddnetbio.com. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
38127088	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	GTAD: a graph-based approach for cell spatial composition inference from integrated scRNA-seq and ST-seq data.	With the emergence of spatial transcriptome sequencing (ST-seq), research now heavily relies on the joint analysis of ST-seq and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to precisely identify cell spatial composition in tissues. However, common methods for combining these datasets often merge data from multiple cells to generate pseudo-ST data, overlooking topological relationships and failing to represent spatial arrangements accurately. We introduce GTAD, a method utilizing the Graph Attention Network for deconvolution of integrated scRNA-seq and ST-seq data. GTAD effectively captures cell spatial relationships and topological structures within tissues using a graph-based approach, enhancing cell-type identification and our understanding of complex tissue cellular landscapes. By integrating scRNA-seq and ST data into a unified graph structure, GTAD outperforms traditional 'pseudo-ST' methods, providing robust and information-rich results. GTAD performs exceptionally well with synthesized spatial data and accurately identifies cell spatial composition in tissues like the mouse cerebral cortex, cerebellum, developing human heart and pancreatic ductal carcinoma. GTAD holds the potential to enhance our understanding of tissue microenvironments and cellular diversity in complex bio-logical systems. The source code is available at https://github.com/zzhjs/GTAD.
39265120	2025	Nucleic acids research	PerturbDB for unraveling gene functions and regulatory networks.	Perturb-Seq combines CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-based genetic screens with single-cell RNA sequencing readouts for high-content phenotypic screens. Despite the rapid accumulation of Perturb-Seq datasets, there remains a lack of a user-friendly platform for their efficient reuse. Here, we developed PerturbDB (http://research.gzsys.org.cn/perturbdb), a platform to help users unveil gene functions using Perturb-Seq datasets. PerturbDB hosts 66 Perturb-Seq datasets, which encompass 4 518 521 single-cell transcriptomes derived from the knockdown of 10 194 genes across 19 different cell lines. All datasets were uniformly processed using the Mixscape algorithm. Genes were clustered by their perturbed transcriptomic phenotypes derived from Perturb-Seq data, resulting in 421 gene clusters, 157 of which were stable across different cellular contexts. Through integrating chemically perturbed transcriptomes with Perturb-Seq data, we identified 552 potential inhibitors targeting 1409 genes, including an mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling inhibitor, retinol, which was experimentally verified. Moreover, we developed a 'Cancer' module to facilitate the understanding of the regulatory role of genes in cancer using Perturb-Seq data. An interactive web interface has also been developed, enabling users to visualize, analyze and download all the comprehensive datasets available in PerturbDB. PerturbDB will greatly drive gene functional studies and enhance our understanding of the regulatory roles of genes in diseases such as cancer.
30573817	2019	Nature methods	A test metric for assessing single-cell RNA-seq batch correction.	Single-cell transcriptomics is a versatile tool for exploring heterogeneous cell populations, but as with all genomics experiments, batch effects can hamper data integration and interpretation. The success of batch-effect correction is often evaluated by visual inspection of low-dimensional embeddings, which are inherently imprecise. Here we present a user-friendly, robust and sensitive k-nearest-neighbor batch-effect test (kBET; https://github.com/theislab/kBET ) for quantification of batch effects. We used kBET to assess commonly used batch-regression and normalization approaches, and to quantify the extent to which they remove batch effects while preserving biological variability. We also demonstrate the application of kBET to data from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors to distinguish cell-type-specific inter-individual variability from changes in relative proportions of cell populations. This has important implications for future data-integration efforts, central to projects such as the Human Cell Atlas.
34083792	2021	Nature biotechnology	Scalable, multimodal profiling of chromatin accessibility, gene expression and protein levels in single cells.	Recent technological advances have enabled massively parallel chromatin profiling with scATAC-seq (single-cell assay for transposase accessible chromatin by sequencing). Here we present ATAC with select antigen profiling by sequencing (ASAP-seq), a tool to simultaneously profile accessible chromatin and protein levels. Our approach pairs sparse scATAC-seq data with robust detection of hundreds of cell surface and intracellular protein markers and optional capture of mitochondrial DNA for clonal tracking, capturing three distinct modalities in single cells. ASAP-seq uses a bridging approach that repurposes antibody:oligonucleotide conjugates designed for existing technologies that pair protein measurements with single-cell RNA sequencing. Together with DOGMA-seq, an adaptation of CITE-seq (cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing) for measuring gene activity across the central dogma of gene regulation, we demonstrate the utility of systematic multi-omic profiling by revealing coordinated and distinct changes in chromatin, RNA and surface proteins during native hematopoietic differentiation and peripheral blood mononuclear cell stimulation and as a combinatorial decoder and reporter of multiplexed perturbations in primary T cells.
39585902	2024	PLoS computational biology	scGRN-Entropy: Inferring cell differentiation trajectories using single-cell data and gene regulation network-based transfer entropy.	Research on cell differentiation facilitates a deeper understanding of the fundamental processes of life, elucidates the intrinsic mechanisms underlying diseases such as cancer, and advances the development of therapeutics and precision medicine. Existing methods for inferring cell differentiation trajectories from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data primarily rely on static gene expression data to measure distances between cells and subsequently infer pseudotime trajectories. In this work, we introduce a novel method, scGRN-Entropy, for inferring cell differentiation trajectories and pseudotime from scRNA-seq data. Unlike existing approaches, scGRN-Entropy improves inference accuracy by incorporating dynamic changes in gene regulatory networks (GRN). In scGRN-Entropy, an undirected graph representing state transitions between cells is constructed by integrating both static relationships in gene expression space and dynamic relationships in the GRN space. The edges of the undirected graph are then refined using pseudotime inferred based on cell entropy in the GRN space. Finally, the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm is applied to derive the cell differentiation trajectory. We validate the accuracy of scGRN-Entropy on eight different real scRNA-seq datasets, demonstrating its superior performance in inferring cell differentiation trajectories through comparative analysis with existing state-of-the-art methods.
38460192	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Molecular mechanisms reconstruction from single-cell multi-omics data with HuMMuS.	MOTIVATION: The molecular identity of a cell results from a complex interplay between heterogeneous molecular layers. Recent advances in single-cell sequencing technologies have opened the possibility to measure such molecular layers of regulation. RESULTS: Here, we present HuMMuS, a new method for inferring regulatory mechanisms from single-cell multi-omics data. Differently from the state-of-the-art, HuMMuS captures cooperation between biological macromolecules and can easily include additional layers of molecular regulation. We benchmarked HuMMuS with respect to the state-of-the-art on both paired and unpaired multi-omics datasets. Our results proved the improvements provided by HuMMuS in terms of transcription factor (TF) targets, TF binding motifs and regulatory regions prediction.

26689544	2016	Nature biotechnology	Integration of electrophysiological recordings with single-cell RNA-seq data identifies neuronal subtypes.	Traditionally, neuroscientists have defined the identity of neurons by the cells' location, morphology, connectivity and excitability. However, the direct relationship between these parameters and the molecular phenotypes has remained largely unexplored. Here, we present a method for obtaining full transcriptome data from single neocortical pyramidal cells and interneurons after whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in mouse brain slices. In our approach, termed Patch-seq, a patch-clamp stimulus protocol is followed by the aspiration of the entire somatic compartment into the recording pipette, reverse transcription of RNA including addition of unique molecular identifiers, cDNA amplification, Illumina library preparation and sequencing. We show that Patch-seq reveals a close link between electrophysiological characteristics, responses to acute chemical challenges and RNA expression of neurotransmitter receptors and channels. Moreover, it distinguishes neuronal subpopulations that correspond to both well-established and, to our knowledge, hitherto undescribed neuronal subtypes. Our findings demonstrate the ability of Patch-seq to precisely map neuronal subtypes and predict their network contributions in the brain.
40581778	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scGT:integration algorithm for single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq based on graph transformer.	MOTIVATION: Multi-omics analysis of individual cells offers remarkable opportunities for exploring the dynamics and relationships of gene regulatory states across large atlas data. However, the current integration algorithms have limited performance, largely due to ignoring the impact of correlation features within the dataset on the discrepancies between omics. RESULTS: In this study, we propose scGT, a model based on Graph Transformer for single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data, which leverages the robust graph structures strengthened by correlation features present in each raw dataset to harmonize representations of multi-omics data, enabling the integration of multi-omics and effective label transfer. We compare scGT with other state-of-the-art methods on paired and unpaired datasets. The results show that scGT accomplishes more accurate label transfer and is capable of integrating datasets with millions of cells. Meanwhile, scGT achieves better performance for preserving biological variation during integration. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code and data used in this article can be found at https://github.com/Jinsl-lab/scGT.
35637418	2022	Nature biotechnology	Scalable single-cell RNA sequencing from full transcripts with Smart-seq3xpress.	Current single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) methods with high cellular throughputs sacrifice full-transcript coverage and often sensitivity. Here we describe Smart-seq3xpress, which miniaturizes and streamlines the Smart-seq3 protocol to substantially reduce reagent use and increase cellular throughput. Smart-seq3xpress analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells resulted in a granular atlas complete with common and rare cell types. Compared with droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing that sequences RNA ends, the additional full-transcript coverage revealed cell-type-associated isoform variation.
31500660	2019	Genome biology	A comparison of automatic cell identification methods for single-cell RNA sequencing data.	BACKGROUND: Single-cell transcriptomics is rapidly advancing our understanding of the cellular composition of complex tissues and organisms. A major limitation in most analysis pipelines is the reliance on manual annotations to determine cell identities, which are time-consuming and irreproducible. The exponential growth in the number of cells and samples has prompted the adaptation and development of supervised classification methods for automatic cell identification. RESULTS: Here, we benchmarked 22 classification methods that automatically assign cell identities including single-cell-specific and general-purpose classifiers. The performance of the methods is evaluated using 27 publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing datasets of different sizes, technologies, species, and levels of complexity. We use 2 experimental setups to evaluate the performance of each method for within dataset predictions (intra-dataset) and across datasets (inter-dataset) based on accuracy, percentage of unclassified cells, and computation time. We further evaluate the methods' sensitivity to the input features, number of cells per population, and their performance across different annotation levels and datasets. We find that most classifiers perform well on a variety of datasets with decreased accuracy for complex datasets with overlapping classes or deep annotations. The general-purpose support vector machine classifier has overall the best performance across the different experiments. CONCLUSIONS: We present a comprehensive evaluation of automatic cell identification methods for single-cell RNA sequencing data. All the code used for the evaluation is available on GitHub ( https://github.com/tabdelaal/scRNAseq_Benchmark ). Additionally, we provide a Snakemake workflow to facilitate the benchmarking and to support the extension of new methods and new datasets.

32094658	2020	Nature biotechnology	Targeting the cytoskeleton to direct pancreatic differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells.	Generation of pancreatic beta cells from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) holds promise as a cell replacement therapy for diabetes. In this study, we establish a link between the state of the actin cytoskeleton and the expression of pancreatic transcription factors that drive pancreatic lineage specification. Bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing demonstrated that different degrees of actin polymerization biased cells toward various endodermal lineages and that conditions favoring a polymerized cytoskeleton strongly inhibited neurogenin 3-induced endocrine differentiation. Using latrunculin A to depolymerize the cytoskeleton during endocrine induction, we developed a two-dimensional differentiation protocol for generating human pluripotent stem-cell-derived beta (SC-beta) cells with improved in vitro and in vivo function. SC-beta cells differentiated from four hPSC lines exhibited first- and second-phase dynamic glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Transplantation of islet-sized aggregates of these cells rapidly reversed severe preexisting diabetes in mice at a rate close to that of human islets and maintained normoglycemia for at least 9 months.
35524568	2022	Nucleic acids research	scIMC: a platform for benchmarking comparison and visualization analysis of scRNA-seq data imputation methods.	With the advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), one major challenging is the so-called 'dropout' events that distort gene expression and remarkably influence downstream analysis in single-cell transcriptome. To address this issue, much effort has been done and several scRNA-seq imputation methods were developed with two categories: model-based and deep learning-based. However, comprehensively and systematically comparing existing methods are still lacking. In this work, we use six simulated and two real scRNA-seq datasets to comprehensively evaluate and compare a total of 12 available imputation methods from the following four aspects: (i) gene expression recovering, (ii) cell clustering, (iii) gene differential expression, and (iv) cellular trajectory reconstruction. We demonstrate that deep learning-based approaches generally exhibit better overall performance than model-based approaches under major benchmarking comparison, indicating the power of deep learning for imputation. Importantly, we built scIMC (single-cell Imputation Methods Comparison platform), the first online platform that integrates all available state-of-the-art imputation methods for benchmarking comparison and visualization analysis, which is expected to be a convenient and useful tool for researchers of interest. It is now freely accessible via https://server.wei-group.net/scIMC/.
39800872	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Integrating scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq with inter-type attention heterogeneous graph neural networks.	Single-cell multi-omics techniques, which enable the simultaneous measurement of multiple modalities such as RNA gene expression and Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin (ATAC) within individual cells, have become a powerful tool for deciphering the intricate complexity of cellular systems. Most current methods rely on motif databases to establish cross-modality relationships between genes from RNA-seq data and peaks from ATAC-seq data. However, these approaches are constrained by incomplete database coverage, particularly for novel or poorly characterized relationships. To address these limitations, we introduce single-cell Multi-omics Integration (scMI), a heterogeneous graph embedding method that encodes both cells and modality features from single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data into a shared latent space by learning cross-modality relationships. By modeling cells and modality features as distinct node types, we design an inter-type attention mechanism to effectively capture long-range cross-modality interactions between genes and peaks. Benchmark results demonstrate that embeddings learned by scMI preserve more biological information and achieve comparable or superior performance in downstream tasks including modality prediction, cell clustering, and gene regulatory network inference compared to methods that rely on databases. Furthermore, scMI significantly improves the alignment and integration of unmatched multi-omics data, enabling more accurate embedding and improved outcomes in downstream tasks.
40050124	2025	Genome research	Integrating short-read and long-read single-cell RNA sequencing for comprehensive transcriptome profiling in mouse retina.	The vast majority of protein-coding genes in the human genome produce multiple mRNA isoforms through alternative splicing, significantly enhancing the complexity of the transcriptome and proteome. To establish an efficient method for characterizing transcript isoforms within tissue samples, we conducted a systematic comparison between single-cell long-read and conventional short-read RNA sequencing techniques. The transcriptome of approximately 30,000 mouse retina cells was profiled using 1.54 billion Illumina short reads and 1.40 billion Oxford Nanopore Technologies long reads. Consequently, we identify 44,325 transcript isoforms, with a notable 38% previously uncharacterized and 17% expressed exclusively in distinct cellular subclasses. We observe that long-read sequencing not only matches the gene expression and cell-type annotation performance of short-read sequencing but also excel in the precise identification of transcript isoforms. While transcript isoforms are often shared across various cell types, their relative abundance shows considerable cell type-specific variation. The data generated from our study significantly enhance the existing repertoire of transcript isoforms, thereby establishing a resource for future research into the mechanisms and implications of alternative splicing within retinal biology and its links to related diseases.
32073600	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scTSSR: gene expression recovery for single-cell RNA sequencing using two-side sparse self-representation.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) methods make it possible to reveal gene expression patterns at single-cell resolution. Due to technical defects, dropout events in scRNA-seq will add noise to the gene-cell expression matrix and hinder downstream analysis. Therefore, it is important for recovering the true gene expression levels before carrying out downstream analysis. RESULTS: In this article, we develop an imputation method, called scTSSR, to recover gene expression for scRNA-seq. Unlike most existing methods that impute dropout events by borrowing information across only genes or cells, scTSSR simultaneously leverages information from both similar genes and similar cells using a two-side sparse self-representation model. We demonstrate that scTSSR can effectively capture the Gini coefficients of genes and gene-to-gene correlations observed in single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (smRNA FISH). Down-sampling experiments indicate that scTSSR performs better than existing methods in recovering the true gene expression levels. We also show that scTSSR has a competitive performance in differential expression analysis, cell clustering and cell trajectory inference. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The R package is available at https://github.com/Zhangxf-ccnu/scTSSR. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
34797848	2021	PLoS computational biology	Discriminative feature of cells characterizes cell populations of interest by a small subset of genes.	Organisms are composed of various cell types with specific states. To obtain a comprehensive understanding of the functions of organs and tissues, cell types have been classified and defined by identifying specific marker genes. Statistical tests are critical for identifying marker genes, which often involve evaluating differences in the mean expression levels of genes. Differentially expressed gene (DEG)-based analysis has been the most frequently used method of this kind. However, in association with increases in sample size such as in single-cell analysis, DEG-based analysis has faced difficulties associated with the inflation of P-values. Here, we propose the concept of discriminative feature of cells (DFC), an alternative to using DEG-based approaches. We implemented DFC using logistic regression with an adaptive LASSO penalty to perform binary classification for discriminating a population of interest and variable selection to obtain a small subset of defining genes. We demonstrated that DFC prioritized gene pairs with non-independent expression using artificial data and that DFC enabled characterization of the muscle satellite/progenitor cell population. The results revealed that DFC well captured cell-type-specific markers, specific gene expression patterns, and subcategories of this cell population. DFC may complement DEG-based methods for interpreting large data sets. DEG-based analysis uses lists of genes with differences in expression between groups, while DFC, which can be termed a discriminative approach, has potential applications in the task of cell characterization. Upon recent advances in the high-throughput analysis of single cells, methods of cell characterization such as scRNA-seq can be effectively subjected to the discriminative methods.

34850121	2022	Nucleic acids research	Expression Atlas update: gene and protein expression in multiple species.	The EMBL-EBI Expression Atlas is an added value knowledge base that enables researchers to answer the question of where (tissue, organism part, developmental stage, cell type) and under which conditions (disease, treatment, gender, etc) a gene or protein of interest is expressed. Expression Atlas brings together data from >4500 expression studies from >65 different species, across different conditions and tissues. It makes these data freely available in an easy to visualise form, after expert curation to accurately represent the intended experimental design, re-analysed via standardised pipelines that rely on open-source community developed tools. Each study's metadata are annotated using ontologies. The data are re-analyzed with the aim of reproducing the original conclusions of the underlying experiments. Expression Atlas is currently divided into Bulk Expression Atlas and Single Cell Expression Atlas. Expression Atlas contains data from differential studies (microarray and bulk RNA-Seq) and baseline studies (bulk RNA-Seq and proteomics), whereas Single Cell Expression Atlas is currently dedicated to Single Cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-Seq) studies. The resource has been in continuous development since 2009 and it is available at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa.
39800874	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	CellMsg: graph convolutional networks for ligand-receptor-mediated cell-cell communication analysis.	The role of cell-cell communications (CCCs) is increasingly recognized as being important to differentiation, invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance in tumoral tissues. Developing CCC inference methods using traditional experimental methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, cannot handle large amounts of data. To facilitate inference of CCCs, we proposed a computational framework, called CellMsg, which involves two primary steps: identifying ligand-receptor interactions (LRIs) and measuring the strength of LRIs-mediated CCCs. Specifically, CellMsg first identifies high-confident LRIs based on multimodal features of ligands and receptors and graph convolutional networks. Then, CellMsg measures the strength of intercellular communication by combining the identified LRIs and single-cell RNA-seq data using a three-point estimation method. Performance evaluation on four benchmark LRI datasets by five-fold cross validation demonstrated that CellMsg accurately captured the relationships between ligands and receptors, resulting in the identification of high-confident LRIs. Compared with other methods of identifying LRIs, CellMsg has better prediction performance and robustness. Furthermore, the LRIs identified by CellMsg were successfully validated through molecular docking. Finally, we examined the overlap of LRIs between CellMsg and five other classical CCC databases, as well as the intercellular crosstalk among seven cell types within a human melanoma tissue. In summary, CellMsg establishes a complete, reliable, and well-organized LRI database and an effective CCC strength evaluation method for each single-cell RNA-seq data. It provides a computational tool allowing researchers to decipher intercellular communications. CellMsg is freely available at https://github.com/pengsl-lab/CellMsg.
34472585	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	ScCAEs: deep clustering of single-cell RNA-seq via convolutional autoencoder embedding and soft K-means.	Clustering and cell type classification are a vital step of analyzing scRNA-seq data to reveal the complexity of the tissue (e.g. the number of cell types and the transcription characteristics of the respective cell type). Recently, deep learning-based single-cell clustering algorithms become popular since they integrate the dimensionality reduction with clustering. But these methods still have unstable clustering effects for the scRNA-seq datasets with high dropouts or noise. In this study, a novel single-cell RNA-seq deep embedding clustering via convolutional autoencoder embedding and soft K-means (scCAEs) is proposed by simultaneously learning the feature representation and clustering. It integrates the deep learning with convolutional autoencoder to characterize scRNA-seq data and proposes a regularized soft K-means algorithm to cluster cell populations in a learned latent space. Next, a novel constraint is introduced to the clustering objective function to iteratively optimize the clustering results, and more importantly, it is theoretically proved that this objective function optimization ensures the convergence. Moreover, it adds the reconstruction loss to the objective function combining the dimensionality reduction with clustering to find a more suitable embedding space for clustering. The proposed method is validated on a variety of datasets, in which the number of clusters in the mentioned datasets ranges from 4 to 46, and the number of cells ranges from 90 to 30 302. The experimental results show that scCAEs is superior to other state-of-the-art methods on the mentioned datasets, and it also keeps the satisfying compatibility and robustness. In addition, for single-cell datasets with the batch effects, scCAEs can ensure the cell separation while removing batch effects.
29903725	2018	Genome research	Human primitive brain displays negative mitochondrial-nuclear expression correlation of respiratory genes.	"Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), a fundamental energy source in all human tissues, requires interactions between mitochondrial (mtDNA)- and nuclear (nDNA)-encoded protein subunits. Although such interactions are fundamental to OXPHOS, bi-genomic coregulation is poorly understood. To address this question, we analyzed  approximately 8500 RNA-seq experiments from 48 human body sites. Despite well-known variation in mitochondrial activity, quantity, and morphology, we found overall positive mtDNA-nDNA OXPHOS genes' co-expression across human tissues. Nevertheless, negative mtDNA-nDNA gene expression correlation was identified in the hypothalamus, basal ganglia, and amygdala (subcortical brain regions, collectively termed the ""primitive"" brain). Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of mouse and human brains revealed that this phenomenon is evolutionarily conserved, and both are influenced by brain cell types (involving excitatory/inhibitory neurons and nonneuronal cells) and by their spatial brain location. As the ""primitive"" brain is highly oxidative, we hypothesized that such negative mtDNA-nDNA co-expression likely controls for the high mtDNA transcript levels, which enforce tight OXPHOS regulation, rather than rewiring toward glycolysis. Accordingly, we found ""primitive"" brain-specific up-regulation of lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB), which associates with high OXPHOS activity, at the expense of LDHA, which promotes glycolysis. Analyses of co-expression, DNase-seq, and ChIP-seq experiments revealed candidate RNA-binding proteins and CEBPB as the best regulatory candidates to explain these phenomena. Finally, cross-tissue expression analysis unearthed tissue-dependent splice variants and OXPHOS subunit paralogs and allowed revising the list of canonical OXPHOS transcripts. Taken together, our analysis provides a comprehensive view of mito-nuclear gene co-expression across human tissues and provides overall insights into the bi-genomic regulation of mitochondrial activities."
37833841	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	SGAE: single-cell gene association entropy for revealing critical states of cell transitions during embryonic development.	The critical point or pivotal threshold of cell transition occurs in early embryonic development when cell differentiation culminates in its transition to specific cell fates, at which the cell population undergoes an abrupt and qualitative shift. Revealing such critical points of cell transitions can track cellular heterogeneity and shed light on the molecular mechanisms of cell differentiation. However, precise detection of critical state transitions proves challenging when relying on single-cell RNA sequencing data due to their inherent sparsity, noise, and heterogeneity. In this study, diverging from conventional methods like differential gene analysis or static techniques that emphasize classification of cell types, an innovative computational approach, single-cell gene association entropy (SGAE), is designed for the analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data and utilizes gene association information to reveal critical states of cell transitions. More specifically, through the translation of gene expression data into local SGAE scores, the proposed SGAE can serve as an index to quantitatively assess the resilience and critical properties of genetic regulatory networks, consequently detecting the signal of cell transitions. Analyses of five single-cell datasets for embryonic development demonstrate that the SGAE method achieves better performance in facilitating the characterization of a critical phase transition compared with other existing methods. Moreover, the SGAE value can effectively discriminate cellular heterogeneity over time and performs well in the temporal clustering of cells. Besides, biological functional analysis also indicates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
28655331	2017	Genome biology	BRIE: transcriptome-wide splicing quantification in single cells.	Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) provides a comprehensive measurement of stochasticity in transcription, but the limitations of the technology have prevented its application to dissect variability in RNA processing events such as splicing. Here, we present BRIE (Bayesian regression for isoform estimation), a Bayesian hierarchical model that resolves these problems by learning an informative prior distribution from sequence features. We show that BRIE yields reproducible estimates of exon inclusion ratios in single cells and provides an effective tool for differential isoform quantification between scRNA-seq data sets. BRIE, therefore, expands the scope of scRNA-seq experiments to probe the stochasticity of RNA processing.

Inferring gene regulatory networks from single-cell RNA-sequencing trajectories has been an active area of research yet methods are still needed to identify regulators governing cell transitions. We developed DREAMIT (Dynamic Regulation of Expression Across Modules in Inferred Trajectories) to annotate transcription-factor activity along single-cell trajectory branches, using ensembles of relations to target genes. Using a benchmark representing several different tissues, as well as external validation with ATAC-Seq and Perturb-Seq data on hematopoietic cells, the method was found to have higher tissue-specific sensitivity and specificity over competing approaches.
31503285	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	QUBIC2: a novel and robust biclustering algorithm for analyses and interpretation of large-scale RNA-Seq data.	MOTIVATION: The biclustering of large-scale gene expression data holds promising potential for detecting condition-specific functional gene modules (i.e. biclusters). However, existing methods do not adequately address a comprehensive detection of all significant bicluster structures and have limited power when applied to expression data generated by RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq), especially single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) data, where massive zero and low expression values are observed. RESULTS: We present a new biclustering algorithm, QUalitative BIClustering algorithm Version 2 (QUBIC2), which is empowered by: (i) a novel left-truncated mixture of Gaussian model for an accurate assessment of multimodality in zero-enriched expression data, (ii) a fast and efficient dropouts-saving expansion strategy for functional gene modules optimization using information divergency and (iii) a rigorous statistical test for the significance of all the identified biclusters in any organism, including those without substantial functional annotations. QUBIC2 demonstrated considerably improved performance in detecting biclusters compared to other five widely used algorithms on various benchmark datasets from E.coli, Human and simulated data. QUBIC2 also showcased robust and superior performance on gene expression data generated by microarray, bulk RNA-Seq and scRNA-Seq. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code of QUBIC2 is freely available at https://github.com/OSU-BMBL/QUBIC2.

36715274	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	SMURF: embedding single-cell RNA-seq data with matrix factorization preserving self-consistency.	The advance in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) sheds light on cell-specific transcriptomic studies of cell developments, complex diseases and cancers. Nevertheless, scRNA-seq techniques suffer from 'dropout' events, and imputation tools are proposed to address the sparsity. Here, rather than imputation, we propose a tool, SMURF, to extract the low-dimensional embeddings from cells and genes utilizing matrix factorization with a mixture of Poisson-Gamma divergent as objective while preserving self-consistency. SMURF exhibits feasible cell subpopulation discovery efficacy with obtained cell embeddings on replicated in silico and eight web lab scRNA datasets with ground truth cell types. Furthermore, SMURF can reduce the cell embedding to a 1D-oval space to recover the time course of cell cycle. SMURF can also serve as an imputation tool; the in silico data assessment shows that SMURF parades the most robust gene expression recovery power with low root mean square error and high Pearson correlation. Moreover, SMURF recovers the gene distribution for the WM989 Drop-seq data. SMURF is available at https://github.com/deepomicslab/SMURF.
33907801	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	Analyzing master regulators and scRNA-seq of COVID-19 patients reveals an underlying anti-SARS-CoV-2 mechanism of ZNF proteins.	Studies have demonstrated that both mortality and severe illness rates exist significant difference in different gender COVID-19 patients, but the reasons are still very mysterious to date. Here, we firstly find that the survival outcome of female patients is better to male patients through analyzing the 3044 COVID-19 cases. Secondly, we identify many important master regulators [e.g. STAT1/STAT2 and zinc finger (ZNF) proteins], in particular female patients can express more ZNF proteins and stronger transcriptional activities than male patients in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thirdly, we discover that ZNF protein activity is significantly negative correlation with the SARS-CoV-2 load of COVID-19 patients, and ZNF proteins as transcription factors can also activate their target genes to participate in anti-SARS-CoV-2 infection. Fourthly, we demonstrate that ZNF protein activity is positive correlation with the abundance of multiple immune cells of COVID-19 patients, implying that the highly ZNF protein activity might promote the abundance and the antiviral activity of multiple immune cells to effectively suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection. Taken together, our study proposes an underlying anti-SARS-COV-2 role of ZNF proteins, and differences in the amount and activity of ZNF proteins might be responsible for the distinct prognosis of different gender COVID-19 patients.
37267208	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Consensus label propagation with graph convolutional networks for single-cell RNA sequencing cell type annotation.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, annotated by cell type, is useful in a variety of downstream biological applications, such as profiling gene expression at the single-cell level. However, manually assigning these annotations with known marker genes is both time-consuming and subjective. RESULTS: We present a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)-based approach to automate the annotation process. Our process builds upon existing labeling approaches, using state-of-the-art tools to find cells with highly confident label assignments through consensus and spreading these confident labels with a semi-supervised GCN. Using simulated data and two scRNA-seq datasets from different tissues, we show that our method improves accuracy over a simple consensus algorithm and the average of the underlying tools. We also compare our method to a nonparametric neighbor majority approach, showing comparable results. We then demonstrate that our GCN method allows for feature interpretation, identifying important genes for cell type classification. We present our completed pipeline, written in PyTorch, as an end-to-end tool for automating and interpreting the classification of scRNA-seq data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Our code for conducting the experiments in this paper and using our model is available at https://github.com/lewinsohndp/scSHARP.
35514182	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	A Markov random field model-based approach for differentially expressed gene detection from single-cell RNA-seq data.	The development of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies has offered insights into complex biological systems at the single-cell resolution. In particular, these techniques facilitate the identifications of genes showing cell-type-specific differential expressions (DE). In this paper, we introduce MARBLES, a novel statistical model for cross-condition DE gene detection from scRNA-seq data. MARBLES employs a Markov Random Field model to borrow information across similar cell types and utilizes cell-type-specific pseudobulk count to account for sample-level variability. Our simulation results showed that MARBLES is more powerful than existing methods to detect DE genes with an appropriate control of false positive rate. Applications of MARBLES to real data identified novel disease-related DE genes and biological pathways from both a single-cell lipopolysaccharide mouse dataset with 24 381 cells and 11 076 genes and a Parkinson's disease human data set with 76 212 cells and 15 891 genes. Overall, MARBLES is a powerful tool to identify cell-type-specific DE genes across conditions from scRNA-seq data.
37756593	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	GOWDL: gene ontology-driven wide and deep learning model for cell typing of scRNA-seq data.	Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows for obtaining genomic and transcriptomic profiles of individual cells. That data make it possible to characterize tissues at the cell level. In this context, one of the main analyses exploiting scRNA-seq data is identifying the cell types within tissue to estimate the quantitative composition of cell populations. Due to the massive amount of available scRNA-seq data, automatic classification approaches for cell typing, based on the most recent deep learning technology, are needed. Here, we present the gene ontology-driven wide and deep learning (GOWDL) model for classifying cell types in several tissues. GOWDL implements a hybrid architecture that considers the functional annotations found in Gene Ontology and the marker genes typical of specific cell types. We performed cross-validation and independent external testing, comparing our algorithm with 12 other state-of-the-art predictors. Classification scores demonstrated that GOWDL reached the best results over five different tissues, except for recall, where we got about 92% versus 97% of the best tool. Finally, we presented a case study on classifying immune cell populations in breast cancer using a hierarchical approach based on GOWDL.
41039482	2025	Genome biology	BLEND: probabilistic cellular deconvolution with individualized single-cell reference integration.	Cellular deconvolution estimates cell-type fractions from bulk transcriptomic data, but current methods often overlook cell type-specific expression varying across samples, discrepancies between bulk and single-cell data, or lack guidance on reference data selection and integration. Therefore, we present BLEND, a hierarchical Bayesian method that leverages multiple single-cell reference datasets to perform cellular deconvolution. BLEND estimates cellular fractions accurately by learning the most suitable reference for each bulk sample, accounting for the aforementioned issues. BLEND outperforms state-of-the-art methods in comprehensive benchmarking studies using human brain cortex data and provides reliable insights into Alzheimer's disease progression.
38810116	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Inferring gene regulatory networks from single-cell transcriptomics based on graph embedding.	MOTIVATION: Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) encode gene regulation in living organisms, and have become a critical tool to understand complex biological processes. However, due to the dynamic and complex nature of gene regulation, inferring GRNs from scRNA-seq data is still a challenging task. Existing computational methods usually focus on the close connections between genes, and ignore the global structure and distal regulatory relationships. RESULTS: In this study, we develop a supervised deep learning framework, IGEGRNS, to infer GRNs from scRNA-seq data based on graph embedding. In the framework, contextual information of genes is captured by GraphSAGE, which aggregates gene features and neighborhood structures to generate low-dimensional embedding for genes. Then, the k most influential nodes in the whole graph are filtered through Top-k pooling. Finally, potential regulatory relationships between genes are predicted by stacking CNNs. Compared with nine competing supervised and unsupervised methods, our method achieves better performance on six time-series scRNA-seq datasets. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Our method IGEGRNS is implemented in Python using the Pytorch machine learning library, and it is freely available at https://github.com/DHUDBlab/IGEGRNS.
39350337	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	DrugReSC: targeting disease-critical cell subpopulations with single-cell transcriptomic data for drug repurposing in cancer.	The field of computational drug repurposing aims to uncover novel therapeutic applications for existing drugs through high-throughput data analysis. However, there is a scarcity of drug repurposing methods leveraging the cellular-level information provided by single-cell RNA sequencing data. To address this need, we propose DrugReSC, an innovative approach to drug repurposing utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing data, intending to target specific cell subpopulations critical to disease pathology. DrugReSC constructs a drug-by-cell matrix representing the transcriptional relationships between individual cells and drugs and utilizes permutation-based methods to assess drug contributions to cellular phenotypic changes. We demonstrate DrugReSC's superior performance compared to existing drug repurposing methods based on bulk or single-cell RNA sequencing data across multiple cancer case studies. In summary, DrugReSC offers a novel perspective on the utilization of single-cell sequencing data in drug repurposing methods, contributing to the advancement of precision medicine for cancer.
30102368	2018	Nucleic acids research	CellBIC: bimodality-based top-down clustering of single-cell RNA sequencing data reveals hierarchical structure of the cell type.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool to study heterogeneity and dynamic changes in cell populations. Clustering scRNA-seq is essential in identifying new cell types and studying their characteristics. We develop CellBIC (single Cell BImodal Clustering) to cluster scRNA-seq data based on modality in the gene expression distribution. Compared with classical bottom-up approaches that rely on a distance metric, CellBIC performs hierarchical clustering in a top-down manner. CellBIC outperformed the bottom-up hierarchical clustering approach and other recently developed clustering algorithms while maintaining the hierarchical structure of cells. Importantly, CellBIC identifies type 2 diabetes and age specific beta cell signatures characterized by SIX3 and CDH2, respectively.
41067889	2025	Genome research	Optimal marker genes for c-separated cell types with SepSolve.	The identification of cell types in single-cell RNA-seq studies relies on the distinct expression signature of marker genes. A small set of target genes is also needed to design probes for targeted spatial transcriptomic experiments and to target proteins in single-cell spatial proteomics or for cell sorting. Although traditional approaches have relied on testing one gene at a time for differential expression between a given cell type and the rest, more recent methods have highlighted the benefits of a joint selection of markers that together distinguish all pairs of cell types simultaneously. However, existing methods either consider all pairs of individual cells, which becomes intractable even for medium-sized data sets, or ignore intra-cell-type expression variation entirely by collapsing all cells of a given type to a single representative. Here, we address these limitations and propose to find a small set of genes such that cell types are c-separated in the selected dimensions, a notion introduced previously in learning a mixture of Gaussians. To this end, we formulate a linear program that naturally takes into account expression variation within cell types without including each pair of individual cells in the model, leading to a highly stable set of marker genes that allow to accurately discriminate between cell types and that can be computed to optimality efficiently.
41166154	2025	Nucleic acids research	ViMIC 2.0: an updated database of human disease-related viral mutations, integration sites, and multi-omics data.	ViMIC 2.0 is an updated database that provides comprehensively curated data on virus mutations (VMs), viral integration sites (VISs), and multi-omics datasets related to human diseases. Leveraging expanding public data, ViMIC 2.0 significantly enhanced data scale, diversity, and analytical capabilities compared to the previous version. In terms of data volume, the number of virus types has increased from 8 to 28, VM entries have grown from 31 712 to 64 168, virus-related diseases expanded from 77 to 177, literature rose from 2539 to 6433, and omics datasets have substantially increased from 28 sets of single expression profile data to 255 sets of multi-omics data. In addition, ViMIC 2.0 has updated 9409 VISs, 173 048 sequences, newly incorporated sequencing types such as single-cell transcriptomic sequencing (scRNA-seq), and genome binding/occupancy profiling. Regarding the visualization module, ViMIC 2.0 now provides results of differential gene expression analysis for bulk RNA-seq or array, cell type annotation and gene feature plot for scRNA-seq data, and differential methylation analysis for methylation profiling, as well as peak annotation for ChIP-seq/ChIP-on-chip/ATAC-seq data. In summary, ViMIC 2.0 serves as a user-friendly, up-to-date, and well-maintained resource for the virology research community.

31604482	2019	Genome biology	MetaCell: analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data using K-nn graph partitions.	scRNA-seq profiles each represent a highly partial sample of mRNA molecules from a unique cell that can never be resampled, and robust analysis must separate the sampling effect from biological variance. We describe a methodology for partitioning scRNA-seq datasets into metacells: disjoint and homogenous groups of profiles that could have been resampled from the same cell. Unlike clustering analysis, our algorithm specializes at obtaining granular as opposed to maximal groups. We show how to use metacells as building blocks for complex quantitative transcriptional maps while avoiding data smoothing. Our algorithms are implemented in the MetaCell R/C++ software package.
26600239	2015	PLoS computational biology	SINCERA: A Pipeline for Single-Cell RNA-Seq Profiling Analysis.	A major challenge in developmental biology is to understand the genetic and cellular processes/programs driving organ formation and differentiation of the diverse cell types that comprise the embryo. While recent studies using single cell transcriptome analysis illustrate the power to measure and understand cellular heterogeneity in complex biological systems, processing large amounts of RNA-seq data from heterogeneous cell populations creates the need for readily accessible tools for the analysis of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) profiles. The present study presents a generally applicable analytic pipeline (SINCERA: a computational pipeline for SINgle CEll RNA-seq profiling Analysis) for processing scRNA-seq data from a whole organ or sorted cells. The pipeline supports the analysis for: 1) the distinction and identification of major cell types; 2) the identification of cell type specific gene signatures; and 3) the determination of driving forces of given cell types. We applied this pipeline to the RNA-seq analysis of single cells isolated from embryonic mouse lung at E16.5. Through the pipeline analysis, we distinguished major cell types of fetal mouse lung, including epithelial, endothelial, smooth muscle, pericyte, and fibroblast-like cell types, and identified cell type specific gene signatures, bioprocesses, and key regulators. SINCERA is implemented in R, licensed under the GNU General Public License v3, and freely available from CCHMC PBGE website, https://research.cchmc.org/pbge/sincera.html.
28977646	2018	Nucleic acids research	VDJdb: a curated database of T-cell receptor sequences with known antigen specificity.	The ability to decode antigen specificities encapsulated in the sequences of rearranged T-cell receptor (TCR) genes is critical for our understanding of the adaptive immune system and promises significant advances in the field of translational medicine. Recent developments in high-throughput sequencing methods (immune repertoire sequencing technology, or RepSeq) and single-cell RNA sequencing technology have allowed us to obtain huge numbers of TCR sequences from donor samples and link them to T-cell phenotypes. However, our ability to annotate these TCR sequences still lags behind, owing to the enormous diversity of the TCR repertoire and the scarcity of available data on T-cell specificities. In this paper, we present VDJdb, a database that stores and aggregates the results of published T-cell specificity assays and provides a universal platform that couples antigen specificities with TCR sequences. We demonstrate that VDJdb is a versatile instrument for the annotation of TCR repertoire data, enabling a concatenated view of antigen-specific TCR sequence motifs. VDJdb can be accessed at https://vdjdb.cdr3.net and https://github.com/antigenomics/vdjdb-db.

MOTIVATION: Recent transcriptome studies have revealed that total transcript numbers vary by cell type and condition; therefore, the statistical assumptions for single-cell transcriptome studies must be revisited. SAMstrt is an extension code for SAMseq, which is a statistical method for differential expression, to enable spike-in normalization and statistical testing based on the estimated absolute number of transcripts per cell for single-cell RNA-seq methods.

35453146	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	scDeconv: an R package to deconvolve bulk DNA methylation data with scRNA-seq data and paired bulk RNA-DNA methylation data.	Many DNA methylation (DNAm) data are from tissues composed of various cell types, and hence cell deconvolution methods are needed to infer their cell compositions accurately. However, a bottleneck for DNAm data is the lack of cell-type-specific DNAm references. On the other hand, scRNA-seq data are being accumulated rapidly with various cell-type transcriptomic signatures characterized, and also, many paired bulk RNA-DNAm data are publicly available currently. Hence, we developed the R package scDeconv to use these resources to solve the reference deficiency problem of DNAm data and deconvolve them from scRNA-seq data in a trans-omics manner. It assumes that paired samples have similar cell compositions. So the cell content information deconvolved from the scRNA-seq and paired RNA data can be transferred to the paired DNAm samples. Then an ensemble model is trained to fit these cell contents with DNAm features and adjust the paired RNA deconvolution in a co-training manner. Finally, the model can be used on other bulk DNAm data to predict their relative cell-type abundances. The effectiveness of this method is proved by its accurate deconvolution on the three testing datasets here, and if given an appropriate paired dataset, scDeconv can also deconvolve other omics, such as ATAC-seq data. Furthermore, the package also contains other functions, such as identifying cell-type-specific inter-group differential features from bulk DNAm data. scDeconv is available at: https://github.com/yuabrahamliu/scDeconv.
31469823	2019	PLoS computational biology	PanoView: An iterative clustering method for single-cell RNA sequencing data.	Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides new opportunities to gain a mechanistic understanding of many biological processes. Current approaches for single cell clustering are often sensitive to the input parameters and have difficulty dealing with cell types with different densities. Here, we present Panoramic View (PanoView), an iterative method integrated with a novel density-based clustering, Ordering Local Maximum by Convex hull (OLMC), that uses a heuristic approach to estimate the required parameters based on the input data structures. In each iteration, PanoView will identify the most confident cell clusters and repeat the clustering with the remaining cells in a new PCA space. Without adjusting any parameter in PanoView, we demonstrated that PanoView was able to detect major and rare cell types simultaneously and outperformed other existing methods in both simulated datasets and published single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets. Finally, we conducted scRNA-Seq analysis of embryonic mouse hypothalamus, and PanoView was able to reveal known cell types and several rare cell subpopulations.
34893819	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	CellMeSH: probabilistic cell-type identification using indexed literature.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is widely used for analyzing gene expression in multi-cellular systems and provides unprecedented access to cellular heterogeneity. scRNA-seq experiments aim to identify and quantify all cell types present in a sample. Measured single-cell transcriptomes are grouped by similarity and the resulting clusters are mapped to cell types based on cluster-specific gene expression patterns. While the process of generating clusters has become largely automated, annotation remains a laborious ad hoc effort that requires expert biological knowledge. RESULTS: Here, we introduce CellMeSH-a new automated approach to identifying cell types for clusters based on prior literature. CellMeSH combines a database of gene-cell-type associations with a probabilistic method for database querying. The database is constructed by automatically linking gene and cell-type information from millions of publications using existing indexed literature resources. Compared to manually constructed databases, CellMeSH is more comprehensive and is easily updated with new data. The probabilistic query method enables reliable information retrieval even though the gene-cell-type associations extracted from the literature are noisy. CellMeSH is also able to optionally utilize prior knowledge about tissues or cells for further annotation improvement. CellMeSH achieves top-one and top-three accuracies on a number of mouse and human datasets that are consistently better than existing approaches. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Web server at https://uncurl.cs.washington.edu/db_query and API at https://github.com/shunfumao/cellmesh.

39376034	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	MultiSC: a deep learning pipeline for analyzing multiomics single-cell data.	Single-cell technologies enable researchers to investigate cell functions at an individual cell level and study cellular processes with higher resolution. Several multi-omics single-cell sequencing techniques have been developed to explore various aspects of cellular behavior. Using NEAT-seq as an example, this method simultaneously obtains three kinds of omics data for each cell: gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and protein expression of transcription factors (TFs). Consequently, NEAT-seq offers a more comprehensive understanding of cellular activities in multiple modalities. However, there is a lack of tools available for effectively integrating the three types of omics data. To address this gap, we propose a novel pipeline called MultiSC for the analysis of MULTIomic Single-Cell data. Our pipeline leverages a multimodal constraint autoencoder (single-cell hierarchical constraint autoencoder) to integrate the multi-omics data during the clustering process and a matrix factorization-based model (scMF) to predict target genes regulated by a TF. Moreover, we utilize multivariate linear regression models to predict gene regulatory networks from the multi-omics data. Additional functionalities, including differential expression, mediation analysis, and causal inference, are also incorporated into the MultiSC pipeline. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of MultiSC. The results demonstrate that our pipeline enables researchers to gain a comprehensive view of cell activities and gene regulatory networks by fully leveraging the potential of multiomics single-cell data. By employing MultiSC, researchers can effectively integrate and analyze diverse omics data types, enhancing their understanding of cellular processes.
34591957	2022	Nucleic acids research	Gene Expression Nebulas (GEN): a comprehensive data portal integrating transcriptomic profiles across multiple species at both bulk and single-cell levels.	Transcriptomic profiling is critical to uncovering functional elements from transcriptional and post-transcriptional aspects. Here, we present Gene Expression Nebulas (GEN, https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/gen/), an open-access data portal integrating transcriptomic profiles under various biological contexts. GEN features a curated collection of high-quality bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing datasets by using standardized data processing pipelines and a structured curation model. Currently, GEN houses a large number of gene expression profiles from 323 datasets (157 bulk and 166 single-cell), covering 50 500 samples and 15 540 169 cells across 30 species, which are further categorized into six biological contexts. Moreover, GEN integrates a full range of transcriptomic profiles on expression, RNA editing and alternative splicing for 10 bulk datasets, providing opportunities for users to conduct integrative analysis at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. In addition, GEN provides abundant gene annotations based on value-added curation of transcriptomic profiles and delivers online services for data analysis and visualization. Collectively, GEN presents a comprehensive collection of transcriptomic profiles across multiple species, thus serving as a fundamental resource for better understanding genetic regulatory architecture and functional mechanisms from tissues to cells.
39676663	2025	Nucleic acids research	The retinoic acid family-like nuclear receptor SmRAR identified by single-cell transcriptomics of ovarian cells controls oocyte differentiation in Schistosoma mansoni.	Studies on transcription regulation in platyhelminth development are scarce, especially for parasitic flatworms. Here, we employed single-cell transcriptomics to identify genes involved in reproductive development in the trematode model Schistosoma mansoni. This parasite causes schistosomiasis, a major neglected infectious disease affecting >240 million people worldwide. The pathology of schistosomiasis is closely associated with schistosome eggs deposited in host organs including the liver. Unlike other trematodes, schistosomes exhibit distinct sexes, with egg production reliant on the pairing-dependent maturation of female reproductive organs. Despite this significance, the molecular mechanisms underlying ovary development and oocyte differentiation remain largely unexplored. Utilizing an organ isolation approach for S. mansoni, we extracted ovaries of paired females followed by single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) with disassociated oocytes. A total of 1967 oocytes expressing 7872 genes passed quality control (QC) filtering. Unsupervised clustering revealed four distinct cell clusters: somatic, germ cells and progeny, intermediate and late germ cells. Among distinct marker genes for each cluster, we identified a hitherto uncharacterized transcription factor of the retinoic acid receptor family, SmRAR. Functional analyses of SmRAR and associated genes like Smmeiob (meiosis-specific, oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding motif (OB) domain-containing) demonstrated their pairing-dependent and ovary-preferential expression and their decisive roles in oocyte differentiation of S. mansoni.
34929734	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	Deep learning tackles single-cell analysis-a survey of deep learning for scRNA-seq analysis.	Since its selection as the method of the year in 2013, single-cell technologies have become mature enough to provide answers to complex research questions. With the growth of single-cell profiling technologies, there has also been a significant increase in data collected from single-cell profilings, resulting in computational challenges to process these massive and complicated datasets. To address these challenges, deep learning (DL) is positioned as a competitive alternative for single-cell analyses besides the traditional machine learning approaches. Here, we survey a total of 25 DL algorithms and their applicability for a specific step in the single cell RNA-seq processing pipeline. Specifically, we establish a unified mathematical representation of variational autoencoder, autoencoder, generative adversarial network and supervised DL models, compare the training strategies and loss functions for these models, and relate the loss functions of these models to specific objectives of the data processing step. Such a presentation will allow readers to choose suitable algorithms for their particular objective at each step in the pipeline. We envision that this survey will serve as an important information portal for learning the application of DL for scRNA-seq analysis and inspire innovative uses of DL to address a broader range of new challenges in emerging multi-omics and spatial single-cell sequencing.
31373613	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	VirtualCytometry: a webserver for evaluating immune cell differentiation using single-cell RNA sequencing data.	MOTIVATION: The immune system has diverse types of cells that are differentiated or activated via various signaling pathways and transcriptional regulation upon challenging conditions. Immunophenotyping by flow and mass cytometry are the major approaches for identifying key signaling molecules and transcription factors directing the transition between the functional states of immune cells. However, few proteins can be evaluated by flow cytometry in a single experiment, preventing researchers from obtaining a comprehensive picture of the molecular programs involved in immune cell differentiation. Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have enabled unbiased genome-wide quantification of gene expression in individual cells on a large scale, providing a new and versatile analytical pipeline for studying immune cell differentiation. RESULTS: We present VirtualCytometry, a web-based computational pipeline for evaluating immune cell differentiation by exploiting cell-to-cell variation in gene expression with scRNA-seq data. Differentiating cells often show a continuous spectrum of cellular states rather than distinct populations. VirtualCytometry enables the identification of cellular subsets for different functional states of differentiation based on the expression of marker genes. Case studies have highlighted the usefulness of this subset analysis strategy for discovering signaling molecules and transcription factors for human T-cell exhaustion, a state of T-cell dysfunction, in tumor and mouse dendritic cells activated by pathogens. With more than 226 scRNA-seq datasets precompiled from public repositories covering diverse mouse and human immune cell types in normal and disease tissues, VirtualCytometry is a useful resource for the molecular dissection of immune cell differentiation.

38436557	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Innovative super-resolution in spatial transcriptomics: a transformer model exploiting histology images and spatial gene expression.	Spatial transcriptomics technologies have shed light on the complexities of tissue structures by accurately mapping spatial microenvironments. Nonetheless, a myriad of methods, especially those utilized in platforms like Visium, often relinquish spatial details owing to intrinsic resolution limitations. In response, we introduce TransformerST, an innovative, unsupervised model anchored in the Transformer architecture, which operates independently of references, thereby ensuring cost-efficiency by circumventing the need for single-cell RNA sequencing. TransformerST not only elevates Visium data from a multicellular level to a single-cell granularity but also showcases adaptability across diverse spatial transcriptomics platforms. By employing a vision transformer-based encoder, it discerns latent image-gene expression co-representations and is further enhanced by spatial correlations, derived from an adaptive graph Transformer module. The sophisticated cross-scale graph network, utilized in super-resolution, significantly boosts the model's accuracy, unveiling complex structure-functional relationships within histology images. Empirical evaluations validate its adeptness in revealing tissue subtleties at the single-cell scale. Crucially, TransformerST adeptly navigates through image-gene co-representation, maximizing the synergistic utility of gene expression and histology images, thereby emerging as a pioneering tool in spatial transcriptomics. It not only enhances resolution to a single-cell level but also introduces a novel approach that optimally utilizes histology images alongside gene expression, providing a refined lens for investigating spatial transcriptomics.
37224539	2023	Nucleic acids research	STellaris: a web server for accurate spatial mapping of single cells based on spatial transcriptomics data.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides insights into gene expression heterogeneities in diverse cell types underlying homeostasis, development and pathological states. However, the loss of spatial information hinders its applications in deciphering spatially related features, such as cell-cell interactions in a spatial context. Here, we present STellaris (https://spatial.rhesusbase.com), a web server aimed to rapidly assign spatial information to scRNA-seq data based on their transcriptomic similarity with public spatial transcriptomics (ST) data. STellaris is founded on 101 manually curated ST datasets comprising 823 sections across different organs, developmental stages and pathological states from humans and mice. STellaris accepts raw count matrix and cell type annotation of scRNA-seq data as the input, and maps single cells to spatial locations in the tissue architecture of properly matched ST section. Spatially resolved information for intercellular communications, such as spatial distance and ligand-receptor interactions (LRIs), are further characterized between annotated cell types. Moreover, we also expanded the application of STellaris in spatial annotation of multiple regulatory levels with single-cell multiomics data, using the transcriptome as a bridge. STellaris was applied to several case studies to showcase its utility of adding value to the ever-growing scRNA-seq data from a spatial perspective.
29334988	2018	Genome biology	Epidermal Wnt signalling regulates transcriptome heterogeneity and proliferative fate in neighbouring cells.	BACKGROUND: Canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signalling regulates self-renewal and lineage selection within the mammalian epidermis. Although the transcriptional response of keratinocytes that receive a Wnt signal is well characterized, little is known about the mechanism by which keratinocytes in proximity to the Wnt-receiving cell are co-opted to undergo a change in cell fate. RESULTS: To address this, we perform single-cell RNA-sequencing on mouse keratinocytes co-cultured with and without beta-catenin-activated neighbouring cells. We identify five distinct cell states in cultures that had not been exposed to the beta-catenin stimulus and show that the stimulus redistributes wild-type subpopulation proportions. Using temporal single-cell analysis, we reconstruct the cell fate change induced by Wnt activation from neighbouring cells. Gene expression heterogeneity is reduced in neighbouring cells and this effect is most dramatic for protein synthesis-associated genes. Changes in gene expression are accompanied by a shift to a more proliferative stem cell state. By integrating imaging and reconstructed sequential gene expression changes during the state transition we identify transcription factors, including Smad4 and Bcl3, that are responsible for effecting the transition in a contact-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that non-cell autonomous Wnt/beta-catenin signalling decreases transcriptional heterogeneity. This furthers our understanding of how epidermal Wnt signalling orchestrates regeneration and self-renewal.
36813563	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	scSTAR reveals hidden heterogeneity with a real-virtual cell pair structure across conditions in single-cell RNA sequencing data.	Cell-state transition can reveal additional information from single-cell ribonucleic acid (RNA)-sequencing data in time-resolved biological phenomena. However, most of the current methods are based on the time derivative of the gene expression state, which restricts them to the short-term evolution of cell states. Here, we present single-cell State Transition Across-samples of RNA-seq data (scSTAR), which overcomes this limitation by constructing a paired-cell projection between biological conditions with an arbitrary time span by maximizing the covariance between two feature spaces using partial least square and minimum squared error methods. In mouse ageing data, the response to stress in CD4+ memory T cell subtypes was found to be associated with ageing. A novel Treg subtype characterized by mTORC activation was identified to be associated with antitumour immune suppression, which was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy and survival analysis in 11 cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas Program. On melanoma data, scSTAR improved immunotherapy-response prediction accuracy from 0.8 to 0.96.
35032393	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	CrossTalkeR: analysis and visualization of ligand-receptorne tworks.	MOTIVATION: Ligand-receptor (LR) network analysis allows the characterization of cellular crosstalk based on single cell RNA-seq data. However, current methods typically provide a list of inferred LR interactions and do not allow the researcher to focus on specific cell types, ligands or receptors. In addition, most of these methods cannot quantify changes in crosstalk between two biological phenotypes. RESULTS: CrossTalkeR is a framework for network analysis and visualization of LR interactions. CrossTalkeR identifies relevant ligands, receptors and cell types contributing to changes in cell communication when contrasting two biological phenotypes, i.e. disease versus homeostasis. A case study on scRNA-seq of human myeloproliferative neoplasms reinforces the strengths of CrossTalkeR for characterization of changes in cellular crosstalk in disease. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: CrosstalkeR is an R package available at: Github: https://github.com/CostaLab/CrossTalkeR.

38254214	2024	Genome biology	SURGE: uncovering context-specific genetic-regulation of gene expression from single-cell RNA sequencing using latent-factor models.	Genetic regulation of gene expression is a complex process, with genetic effects known to vary across cellular contexts such as cell types and environmental conditions. We developed SURGE, a method for unsupervised discovery of context-specific expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) from single-cell transcriptomic data. This allows discovery of the contexts or cell types modulating genetic regulation without prior knowledge. Applied to peripheral blood single-cell eQTL data, SURGE contexts capture continuous representations of distinct cell types and groupings of biologically related cell types. We demonstrate the disease-relevance of SURGE context-specific eQTLs using colocalization analysis and stratified LD-score regression.
28369191	2017	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	The RNASeq-er API-a gateway to systematically updated analysis of public RNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: The exponential growth of publicly available RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) data poses an increasing challenge to researchers wishing to discover, analyse and store such data, particularly those based in institutions with limited computational resources. EMBL-EBI is in an ideal position to address these challenges and to allow the scientific community easy access to not just raw, but also processed RNA-Seq data. We present a Web service to access the results of a systematically and continually updated standardized alignment as well as gene and exon expression quantification of all public bulk (and in the near future also single-cell) RNA-Seq runs in 264 species in European Nucleotide Archive, using Representational State Transfer.

39708840	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	scRGCL: a cell type annotation method for single-cell RNA-seq data using residual graph convolutional neural network with contrastive learning.	Cell type annotation is a critical step in analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. A large number of deep learning (DL)-based methods have been proposed to annotate cell types of scRNA-seq data and have achieved impressive results. However, there are several limitations to these methods. First, they do not fully exploit cell-to-cell differential features. Second, they are developed based on shallow features and lack of flexibility in integrating high-order features in the data. Finally, the low-dimensional gene features may lead to overfitting in neural networks. To overcome those limitations, we propose a novel DL-based model, cell type annotation of single-cell RNA-seq data using residual graph convolutional neural network with contrastive learning (scRGCL), based on residual graph convolutional neural network and contrastive learning for cell type annotation of single-cell RNA-seq data. scRGCL mainly consists of a residual graph convolutional neural network, contrastive learning, and weight freezing. A residual graph convolutional neural network is utilized to extract complex high-order features from data. Contrastive learning can help the model learn meaningful cell-to-cell differential features. Weight freezing can avoid overfitting and help the model discover the impact of specific gene expression on cell type annotation. To verify the effectiveness of scRGCL, we compared its performance with six methods (three shallow learning algorithms and three state-of-the-art DL-based methods) on eight single-cell benchmark datasets from two species (seven in human and one in mouse). Experimental results not only show that scRGCL outperforms competing methods but also demonstrate the generalizability of scRGCL for cell type annotation. scRGCL is available at https://github.com/nathanyl/scRGCL.
25608970	2015	Genome biology	Quantification of cell identity from single-cell gene expression profiles.	The definition of cell identity is a central problem in biology. While single-cell RNA-seq provides a wealth of information regarding cell states, better methods are needed to map their identity, especially during developmental transitions. Here, we use repositories of cell type-specific transcriptomes to quantify identities from single-cell RNA-seq profiles, accurately classifying cells from Arabidopsis root tips and human glioblastoma tumors. We apply our approach to single cells captured from regenerating roots following tip excision. Our technique exposes a previously uncharacterized transient collapse of identity distant from the injury site, demonstrating the biological relevance of a quantitative cell identity index.
40838782	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Deep clustering of single-cell RNA-seq using adversarial graph contrastive learning.	Single-cell technologies enable the exploration of biological insights at cellular resolution. One of the crucial tasks in the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data is to classify cells into groups of cell types. Recent developments in scRNA-seq clustering methods utilize the strength of contrastive learning and graph-based deep learning to learn high-quality representations which are beneficial for classifying cells. However, the unique characteristics of the scRNA-seq data still pose many computational challenges. This study proposes a novel method for clustering scRNA-seq data using adversarial graph contrastive learning, called scAGCL. The proposed algorithm creates a cell-cell graph and then generates a meaningful representation for clustering based on a contrastive learning process with the support of an adversarial attack on both the graph structures and node features. In addition, a subgraph sampling technique is used to increase the scalability of the method. Experiments on real scRNA-seq datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms seven state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, scAGCL also shows the ability to support the identification of marker genes for cell types. The source code of the proposed method and all datasets used in this paper can be downloaded at https://github.com/levinhcntt/scAGCL.
39757115	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	The network structural entropy for single-cell RNA sequencing data during skin aging.	Aging is a complex and heterogeneous biological process at cellular, tissue, and individual levels. Despite extensive effort in scientific research, a comprehensive understanding of aging mechanisms remains lacking. This study analyzed aging-related gene networks, using single-cell RNA sequencing data from >15 000 cells. We constructed a gene correlation network, integrating gene expressions into the weights of network edges, and ranked gene importance using a random walk model to generate a gene importance matrix. This unsupervised method improved the clustering performance of cell types. To further quantify the complexity of gene networks during aging, we introduced network structural entropy. The findings of our study reveal that the overall network structural entropy increases in the aged cells compared to the young cells. However, network entropy changes varied greatly within different cell subtypes. Specifically, the network structural entropy among various cell types may increase, remain unchanged, or decrease. This wide range of changes may be closely related to their individual functions, highlighting the cellular heterogeneity and potential key network reconfigurations.

30052778	2019	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	GPseudoRank: a permutation sampler for single cell orderings.	MOTIVATION: A number of pseudotime methods have provided point estimates of the ordering of cells for scRNA-seq data. A still limited number of methods also model the uncertainty of the pseudotime estimate. However, there is still a need for a method to sample from complicated and multi-modal distributions of orders, and to estimate changes in the amount of the uncertainty of the order during the course of a biological development, as this can support the selection of suitable cells for the clustering of genes or for network inference. RESULTS: In applications to scRNA-seq data we demonstrate the potential of GPseudoRank to sample from complex and multi-modal posterior distributions and to identify phases of lower and higher pseudotime uncertainty during a biological process. GPseudoRank also correctly identifies cells precocious in their antiviral response and links uncertainty in the ordering to metastable states. A variant of the method extends the advantages of Bayesian modelling and MCMC to large droplet-based scRNA-seq datasets. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Our method is available on github: https://github.com/magStra/GPseudoRank. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
32845323	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	STACAS: Sub-Type Anchor Correction for Alignment in Seurat to integrate single-cell RNA-seq data.	SUMMARY: STACAS is a computational method for the identification of integration anchors in the Seurat environment, optimized for the integration of single-cell (sc) RNA-seq datasets that share only a subset of cell types. We demonstrate that by (i) correcting batch effects while preserving relevant biological variability across datasets, (ii) filtering aberrant integration anchors with a quantitative distance measure and (iii) constructing optimal guide trees for integration, STACAS can accurately align scRNA-seq datasets composed of only partially overlapping cell populations. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Source code and R package available at https://github.com/carmonalab/STACAS; Docker image available at https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/mandrea1/stacas_demo.

33673841	2021	Genome biology	Single cell eQTL analysis identifies cell type-specific genetic control of gene expression in fibroblasts and reprogrammed induced pluripotent stem cells.	BACKGROUND: The discovery that somatic cells can be reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has provided a foundation for in vitro human disease modelling, drug development and population genetics studies. Gene expression plays a critical role in complex disease risk and therapeutic response. However, while the genetic background of reprogrammed cell lines has been shown to strongly influence gene expression, the effect has not been evaluated at the level of individual cells which would provide significant resolution. By integrating single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and population genetics, we apply a framework in which to evaluate cell type-specific effects of genetic variation on gene expression. RESULTS: Here, we perform scRNA-seq on 64,018 fibroblasts from 79 donors and map expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) at the level of individual cell types. We demonstrate that the majority of eQTLs detected in fibroblasts are specific to an individual cell subtype. To address if the allelic effects on gene expression are maintained following cell reprogramming, we generate scRNA-seq data in 19,967 iPSCs from 31 reprogramed donor lines. We again identify highly cell type-specific eQTLs in iPSCs and show that the eQTLs in fibroblasts almost entirely disappear during reprogramming. CONCLUSIONS: This work provides an atlas of how genetic variation influences gene expression across cell subtypes and provides evidence for patterns of genetic architecture that lead to cell type-specific eQTL effects.
36869836	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	scGAD: a new task and end-to-end framework for generalized cell type annotation and discovery.	The rapid development of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology allows us to study gene expression heterogeneity at the cellular level. Cell annotation is the basis for subsequent downstream analysis in single-cell data mining. As more and more well-annotated scRNA-seq reference data become available, many automatic annotation methods have sprung up in order to simplify the cell annotation process on unlabeled target data. However, existing methods rarely explore the fine-grained semantic knowledge of novel cell types absent from the reference data, and they are usually susceptible to batch effects on the classification of seen cell types. Taking into consideration the limitations above, this paper proposes a new and practical task called generalized cell type annotation and discovery for scRNA-seq data whereby target cells are labeled with either seen cell types or cluster labels, instead of a unified 'unassigned' label. To accomplish this, we carefully design a comprehensive evaluation benchmark and propose a novel end-to-end algorithmic framework called scGAD. Specifically, scGAD first builds the intrinsic correspondences on seen and novel cell types by retrieving geometrically and semantically mutual nearest neighbors as anchor pairs. Together with the similarity affinity score, a soft anchor-based self-supervised learning module is then designed to transfer the known label information from reference data to target data and aggregate the new semantic knowledge within target data in the prediction space. To enhance the inter-type separation and intra-type compactness, we further propose a confidential prototype self-supervised learning paradigm to implicitly capture the global topological structure of cells in the embedding space. Such a bidirectional dual alignment mechanism between embedding space and prediction space can better handle batch effect and cell type shift. Extensive results on massive simulation datasets and real datasets demonstrate the superiority of scGAD over various state-of-the-art clustering and annotation methods. We also implement marker gene identification to validate the effectiveness of scGAD in clustering novel cell types and their biological significance. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce this new and practical task and propose an end-to-end algorithmic framework to solve it. Our method scGAD is implemented in Python using the Pytorch machine-learning library, and it is freely available at https://github.com/aimeeyaoyao/scGAD.
32330223	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scHLAcount: allele-specific HLA expression from single-cell gene expression data.	SUMMARY: Bulk RNA sequencing studies have demonstrated that human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes may be expressed in a cell type-specific and allele-specific fashion. Single-cell gene expression assays have the potential to further resolve these expression patterns, but currently available methods do not perform allele-specific quantification at the molecule level. Here, we present scHLAcount, a post-processing workflow for single-cell RNA-seq data that computes allele-specific molecule counts of the HLA genes based on a personalized reference constructed from the sample's HLA genotypes. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: scHLAcount is available under the MIT license at https://github.com/10XGenomics/scHLAcount. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
36765378	2023	Genome biology	SampleQC: robust multivariate, multi-cell type, multi-sample quality control for single-cell data.	Quality control (QC) is a critical component of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) processing pipelines. Current approaches to QC implicitly assume that datasets are comprised of one cell type, potentially resulting in biased exclusion of rare cell types. We introduce SampleQC, which robustly fits a Gaussian mixture model across multiple samples, improves sensitivity, and reduces bias compared to current approaches. We show via simulations that SampleQC is less susceptible to exclusion of rarer cell types. We also demonstrate SampleQC on a complex real dataset (867k cells over 172 samples). SampleQC is general, is implemented in R, and could be applied to other data types.
34252941	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	stPlus: a reference-based method for the accurate enhancement of spatial transcriptomics.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) techniques have revolutionized the investigation of transcriptomic landscape in individual cells. Recent advancements in spatial transcriptomic technologies further enable gene expression profiling and spatial organization mapping of cells simultaneously. Among the technologies, imaging-based methods can offer higher spatial resolutions, while they are limited by either the small number of genes imaged or the low gene detection sensitivity. Although several methods have been proposed for enhancing spatially resolved transcriptomics, inadequate accuracy of gene expression prediction and insufficient ability of cell-population identification still impede the applications of these methods. RESULTS: We propose stPlus, a reference-based method that leverages information in scRNA-seq data to enhance spatial transcriptomics. Based on an auto-encoder with a carefully tailored loss function, stPlus performs joint embedding and predicts spatial gene expression via a weighted k-nearest-neighbor. stPlus outperforms baseline methods with higher gene-wise and cell-wise Spearman correlation coefficients. We also introduce a clustering-based approach to assess the enhancement performance systematically. Using the data enhanced by stPlus, cell populations can be better identified than using the measured data. The predicted expression of genes unique to scRNA-seq data can also well characterize spatial cell heterogeneity. Besides, stPlus is robust and scalable to datasets of diverse gene detection sensitivity levels, sample sizes and number of spatially measured genes. We anticipate stPlus will facilitate the analysis of spatial transcriptomics. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: stPlus with detailed documents is freely accessible at http://health.tsinghua.edu.cn/software/stPlus/ and the source code is openly available on https://github.com/xy-chen16/stPlus.
34155396	2021	Nature methods	The triumphs and limitations of computational methods for scRNA-seq.	The rapid progress of protocols for sequencing single-cell transcriptomes over the past decade has been accompanied by equally impressive advances in the computational methods for analysis of such data. As capacity and accuracy of the experimental techniques grew, the emerging algorithm developments revealed increasingly complex facets of the underlying biology, from cell type composition to gene regulation to developmental dynamics. At the same time, rapid growth has forced continuous reevaluation of the underlying statistical models, experimental aims, and sheer volumes of data processing that are handled by these computational tools. Here, I review key computational steps of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis, examine assumptions made by different approaches, and highlight successes, remaining ambiguities, and limitations that are important to keep in mind as scRNA-seq becomes a mainstream technique for studying biology.
30096152	2018	PLoS computational biology	scPipe: A flexible R/Bioconductor preprocessing pipeline for single-cell RNA-sequencing data.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology allows researchers to profile the transcriptomes of thousands of cells simultaneously. Protocols that incorporate both designed and random barcodes have greatly increased the throughput of scRNA-seq, but give rise to a more complex data structure. There is a need for new tools that can handle the various barcoding strategies used by different protocols and exploit this information for quality assessment at the sample-level and provide effective visualization of these results in preparation for higher-level analyses. To this end, we developed scPipe, an R/Bioconductor package that integrates barcode demultiplexing, read alignment, UMI-aware gene-level quantification and quality control of raw sequencing data generated by multiple protocols that include CEL-seq, MARS-seq, Chromium 10X, Drop-seq and Smart-seq. scPipe produces a count matrix that is essential for downstream analysis along with an HTML report that summarises data quality. These results can be used as input for downstream analyses including normalization, visualization and statistical testing. scPipe performs this processing in a few simple R commands, promoting reproducible analysis of single-cell data that is compatible with the emerging suite of open-source scRNA-seq analysis tools available in R/Bioconductor and beyond. The scPipe R package is available for download from https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/scPipe.
34489600	2022	Nature biotechnology	Integration of spatial and single-cell transcriptomic data elucidates mouse organogenesis.	Molecular profiling of single cells has advanced our knowledge of the molecular basis of development. However, current approaches mostly rely on dissociating cells from tissues, thereby losing the crucial spatial context of regulatory processes. Here, we apply an image-based single-cell transcriptomics method, sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization (seqFISH), to detect mRNAs for 387 target genes in tissue sections of mouse embryos at the 8-12 somite stage. By integrating spatial context and multiplexed transcriptional measurements with two single-cell transcriptome atlases, we characterize cell types across the embryo and demonstrate that spatially resolved expression of genes not profiled by seqFISH can be imputed. We use this high-resolution spatial map to characterize fundamental steps in the patterning of the midbrain-hindbrain boundary (MHB) and the developing gut tube. We uncover axes of cell differentiation that are not apparent from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, such as early dorsal-ventral separation of esophageal and tracheal progenitor populations in the gut tube. Our method provides an approach for studying cell fate decisions in complex tissues and development.
29949988	2018	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Scalable preprocessing for sparse scRNA-seq data exploiting prior knowledge.	MOTIVATION: Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data contains a wealth of information which has to be inferred computationally from the observed sequencing reads. As the ability to sequence more cells improves rapidly, existing computational tools suffer from three problems. (i) The decreased reads-per-cell implies a highly sparse sample of the true cellular transcriptome. (ii) Many tools simply cannot handle the size of the resulting datasets. (iii) Prior biological knowledge such as bulk RNA-seq information of certain cell types or qualitative marker information is not taken into account. Here we present UNCURL, a preprocessing framework based on non-negative matrix factorization for scRNA-seq data, that is able to handle varying sampling distributions, scales to very large cell numbers and can incorporate prior knowledge. RESULTS: We find that preprocessing using UNCURL consistently improves performance of commonly used scRNA-seq tools for clustering, visualization and lineage estimation, both in the absence and presence of prior knowledge. Finally we demonstrate that UNCURL is extremely scalable and parallelizable, and runs faster than other methods on a scRNA-seq dataset containing 1.3 million cells. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Source code is available at https://github.com/yjzhang/uncurl_python. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
38605638	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	SEGCECO: Subgraph Embedding of Gene expression matrix for prediction of CEll-cell COmmunication.	Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing technology have eased analyses of signaling networks of cells. Recently, cell-cell interaction has been studied based on various link prediction approaches on graph-structured data. These approaches have assumptions about the likelihood of node interaction, thus showing high performance for only some specific networks. Subgraph-based methods have solved this problem and outperformed other approaches by extracting local subgraphs from a given network. In this work, we present a novel method, called Subgraph Embedding of Gene expression matrix for prediction of CEll-cell COmmunication (SEGCECO), which uses an attributed graph convolutional neural network to predict cell-cell communication from single-cell RNA-seq data. SEGCECO captures the latent and explicit attributes of undirected, attributed graphs constructed from the gene expression profile of individual cells. High-dimensional and sparse single-cell RNA-seq data make converting the data into a graphical format a daunting task. We successfully overcome this limitation by applying SoptSC, a similarity-based optimization method in which the cell-cell communication network is built using a cell-cell similarity matrix which is learned from gene expression data. We performed experiments on six datasets extracted from the human and mouse pancreas tissue. Our comparative analysis shows that SEGCECO outperforms latent feature-based approaches, and the state-of-the-art method for link prediction, WLNM, with 0.99 ROC and 99% prediction accuracy. The datasets can be found at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE84133 and the code is publicly available at Github https://github.com/sheenahora/SEGCECO and Code Ocean https://codeocean.com/capsule/8244724/tree.
38200118	2024	Nature biotechnology	Prediction of single-cell RNA expression profiles in live cells by Raman microscopy with Raman2RNA.	Single-cell RNA sequencing and other profiling assays have helped interrogate cells at unprecedented resolution and scale, but are inherently destructive. Raman microscopy reports on the vibrational energy levels of proteins and metabolites in a label-free and nondestructive manner at subcellular spatial resolution, but it lacks genetic and molecular interpretability. Here we present Raman2RNA (R2R), a method to infer single-cell expression profiles in live cells through label-free hyperspectral Raman microscopy images and domain translation. We predict single-cell RNA sequencing profiles nondestructively from Raman images using either anchor-based integration with single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization, or anchor-free generation with adversarial autoencoders. R2R outperformed inference from brightfield images (cosine similarities: R2R >0.85 and brightfield <0.15). In reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem cells, R2R inferred the expression profiles of various cell states. With live-cell tracking of mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation, R2R traced the early emergence of lineage divergence and differentiation trajectories, overcoming discontinuities in expression space. R2R lays a foundation for future exploration of live genomic dynamics.
40954304	2025	Nature methods	Cancer subclone detection based on DNA copy number in single-cell and spatial omic sequencing data.	Somatic mutations such as copy number alterations accumulate during cancer progression, driving intratumor heterogeneity that impacts therapy effectiveness. Understanding the characteristics and spatial distribution of genetically distinct subclones is essential for unraveling tumor evolution and improving cancer treatment. Here we present Clonalscope, a subclone detection method using copy number profiles, applicable to spatial transcriptomics and single-cell sequencing data. Clonalscope implements a nested Chinese Restaurant Process to identify de novo tumor subclones, which can incorporate prior information from matched bulk DNA sequencing data for improved subclone detection and malignant cell labeling. On single-cell RNA sequencing and single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing data from gastrointestinal tumors, Clonalscope successfully labeled malignant cells and identified genetically different subclones with thorough validations. On spatial transcriptomics data from various primary and metastasized tumors, Clonalscope labeled malignant spots, traced subclones and identified spatially segregated subclones with distinct differentiation levels and expression of genes associated with drug resistance and survival.
31510652	2019	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	A statistical simulator scDesign for rational scRNA-seq experimental design.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized biological sciences by revealing genome-wide gene expression levels within individual cells. However, a critical challenge faced by researchers is how to optimize the choices of sequencing platforms, sequencing depths and cell numbers in designing scRNA-seq experiments, so as to balance the exploration of the depth and breadth of transcriptome information. RESULTS: Here we present a flexible and robust simulator, scDesign, the first statistical framework for researchers to quantitatively assess practical scRNA-seq experimental design in the context of differential gene expression analysis. In addition to experimental design, scDesign also assists computational method development by generating high-quality synthetic scRNA-seq datasets under customized experimental settings. In an evaluation based on 17 cell types and 6 different protocols, scDesign outperformed four state-of-the-art scRNA-seq simulation methods and led to rational experimental design. In addition, scDesign demonstrates reproducibility across biological replicates and independent studies. We also discuss the performance of multiple differential expression and dimension reduction methods based on the protocol-dependent scRNA-seq data generated by scDesign. scDesign is expected to be an effective bioinformatic tool that assists rational scRNA-seq experimental design and comparison of scRNA-seq computational methods based on specific research goals. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: We have implemented our method in the R package scDesign, which is freely available at https://github.com/Vivianstats/scDesign. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
28263961	2017	Nature methods	Power analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing experiments.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become an established and powerful method to investigate transcriptomic cell-to-cell variation, thereby revealing new cell types and providing insights into developmental processes and transcriptional stochasticity. A key question is how the variety of available protocols compare in terms of their ability to detect and accurately quantify gene expression. Here, we assessed the protocol sensitivity and accuracy of many published data sets, on the basis of spike-in standards and uniform data processing. For our workflow, we developed a flexible tool for counting the number of unique molecular identifiers (https://github.com/vals/umis/). We compared 15 protocols computationally and 4 protocols experimentally for batch-matched cell populations, in addition to investigating the effects of spike-in molecular degradation. Our analysis provides an integrated framework for comparing scRNA-seq protocols.
31159854	2019	Genome biology	Single-cell transcriptomics unveils gene regulatory network plasticity.	BACKGROUND: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) plays a pivotal role in our understanding of cellular heterogeneity. Current analytical workflows are driven by categorizing principles that consider cells as individual entities and classify them into complex taxonomies. RESULTS: We devise a conceptually different computational framework based on a holistic view, where single-cell datasets are used to infer global, large-scale regulatory networks. We develop correlation metrics that are specifically tailored to single-cell data, and then generate, validate, and interpret single-cell-derived regulatory networks from organs and perturbed systems, such as diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. Using tools from graph theory, we compute an unbiased quantification of a gene's biological relevance and accurately pinpoint key players in organ function and drivers of diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Our approach detects multiple latent regulatory changes that are invisible to single-cell workflows based on clustering or differential expression analysis, significantly broadening the biological insights that can be obtained with this leading technology.
34048541	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scDetect: a rank-based ensemble learning algorithm for cell type identification of single-cell RNA sequencing in cancer.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has enabled the characterization of different cell types in many tissues and tumor samples. Cell type identification is essential for single-cell RNA profiling, currently transforming the life sciences. Often, this is achieved by searching for combinations of genes that have previously been implicated as being cell-type specific, an approach that is not quantitative and does not explicitly take advantage of other scRNA-seq studies. Batch effects and different data platforms greatly decrease the predictive performance in inter-laboratory and different data type validation. RESULTS: Here, we present a new ensemble learning method named as 'scDetect' that combines gene expression rank-based analysis and a majority vote ensemble machine-learning probability-based prediction method capable of highly accurate classification of cells based on scRNA-seq data by different sequencing platforms. Because of tumor heterogeneity, in order to accurately predict tumor cells in the single-cell RNA-seq data, we have also incorporated cell copy number variation consensus clustering and epithelial score in the classification. We applied scDetect to scRNA-seq data from pancreatic tissue, mononuclear cells and tumor biopsies cells and show that scDetect classified individual cells with high accuracy and better than other publicly available tools. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: scDetect is an open source software. Source code and test data is freely available from Github (https://github.com/IVDgenomicslab/scDetect/) and Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/record/4764132#.YKCOlrH5AYN). The examples and tutorial page is at https://ivdgenomicslab.github.io/scDetect-Introduction/. And scDetect will be available from Bioconductor. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
36130266	2023	Nucleic acids research	HTCA: a database with an in-depth characterization of the single-cell human transcriptome.	Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is one of the most used single-cell omics in recent decades. The exponential growth of single-cell data has immense potential for large-scale integration and in-depth explorations that are more representative of the study population. Efforts have been made to consolidate published data, yet extensive characterization is still lacking. Many focused on raw-data database constructions while others concentrate mainly on gene expression queries. Hereby, we present HTCA (www.htcatlas.org), an interactive database constructed based on  approximately 2.3 million high-quality cells from  approximately 3000 scRNA-seq samples and comprised in-depth phenotype profiles of 19 healthy adult and matching fetal tissues. HTCA provides a one-stop interactive query to gene signatures, transcription factor (TF) activities, TF motifs, receptor-ligand interactions, enriched gene ontology (GO) terms, etc. across cell types in adult and fetal tissues. At the same time, HTCA encompasses single-cell splicing variant profiles of 16 adult and fetal tissues, spatial transcriptomics profiles of 11 adult and fetal tissues, and single-cell ATAC-sequencing (scATAC-seq) profiles of 27 adult and fetal tissues. Besides, HTCA provides online analysis tools to perform major steps in a typical scRNA-seq analysis. Altogether, HTCA allows real-time explorations of multi-omics adult and fetal phenotypic profiles and provides tools for a flexible scRNA-seq analysis.
31790389	2019	PLoS computational biology	CDSeq: A novel complete deconvolution method for dissecting heterogeneous samples using gene expression data.	Quantifying cell-type proportions and their corresponding gene expression profiles in tissue samples would enhance understanding of the contributions of individual cell types to the physiological states of the tissue. Current approaches that address tissue heterogeneity have drawbacks. Experimental techniques, such as fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and single cell RNA sequencing are expensive. Computational approaches that use expression data from heterogeneous samples are promising, but most of the current methods estimate either cell-type proportions or cell-type-specific expression profiles by requiring the other as input. Although such partial deconvolution methods have been successfully applied to tumor samples, the additional input required may be unavailable. We introduce a novel complete deconvolution method, CDSeq, that uses only RNA-Seq data from bulk tissue samples to simultaneously estimate both cell-type proportions and cell-type-specific expression profiles. Using several synthetic and real experimental datasets with known cell-type composition and cell-type-specific expression profiles, we compared CDSeq's complete deconvolution performance with seven other established deconvolution methods. Complete deconvolution using CDSeq represents a substantial technical advance over partial deconvolution approaches and will be useful for studying cell mixtures in tissue samples. CDSeq is available at GitHub repository (MATLAB and Octave code): https://github.com/kkang7/CDSeq.
34488842	2021	Genome biology	Analytic Pearson residuals for normalization of single-cell RNA-seq UMI data.	BACKGROUND: Standard preprocessing of single-cell RNA-seq UMI data includes normalization by sequencing depth to remove this technical variability, and nonlinear transformation to stabilize the variance across genes with different expression levels. Instead, two recent papers propose to use statistical count models for these tasks: Hafemeister and Satija (Genome Biol 20:296, 2019) recommend using Pearson residuals from negative binomial regression, while Townes et al. (Genome Biol 20:295, 2019) recommend fitting a generalized PCA model. Here, we investigate the connection between these approaches theoretically and empirically, and compare their effects on downstream processing. RESULTS: We show that the model of Hafemeister and Satija produces noisy parameter estimates because it is overspecified, which is why the original paper employs post hoc smoothing. When specified more parsimoniously, it has a simple analytic solution equivalent to the rank-one Poisson GLM-PCA of Townes et al. Further, our analysis indicates that per-gene overdispersion estimates in Hafemeister and Satija are biased, and that the data are in fact consistent with the overdispersion parameter being independent of gene expression. We then use negative control data without biological variability to estimate the technical overdispersion of UMI counts, and find that across several different experimental protocols, the data are close to Poisson and suggest very moderate overdispersion. Finally, we perform a benchmark to compare the performance of Pearson residuals, variance-stabilizing transformations, and GLM-PCA on scRNA-seq datasets with known ground truth. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that analytic Pearson residuals strongly outperform other methods for identifying biologically variable genes, and capture more of the biologically meaningful variation when used for dimensionality reduction.
32324845	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	alona: a web server for single-cell RNA-seq analysis.	SUMMARY: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a technology to measure gene expression in single cells. It has enabled discovery of new cell types and established cell type atlases of tissues and organs. The widespread adoption of scRNA-seq has created a need for user-friendly software for data analysis. We have developed a web server, alona that incorporates several of the most popular single-cell analysis algorithms into a flexible pipeline. alona can perform quality filtering, normalization, batch correction, clustering, cell type annotation and differential gene expression analysis. Data are visualized in the web browser using an interface based on JavaScript, allowing the user to query genes of interest and visualize the cluster structure. alona accepts a compressed gene expression matrix and identifies cell clusters with a graph-based clustering strategy. Cell types are identified from a comprehensive collection of marker genes or by specifying a custom set of marker genes.

39350339	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	scPanel: a tool for automatic identification of sparse gene panels for generalizable patient classification using scRNA-seq datasets.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies can generate transcriptomic profiles at a single-cell resolution in large patient cohorts, facilitating discovery of gene and cellular biomarkers for disease. Yet, when the number of biomarker genes is large, the translation to clinical applications is challenging due to prohibitive sequencing costs. Here, we introduce scPanel, a computational framework designed to bridge the gap between biomarker discovery and clinical application by identifying a sparse gene panel for patient classification from the cell population(s) most responsive to perturbations (e.g. diseases/drugs). scPanel incorporates a data-driven way to automatically determine a minimal number of informative biomarker genes. Patient-level classification is achieved by aggregating the prediction probabilities of cells associated with a patient using the area under the curve score. Application of scPanel to scleroderma, colorectal cancer, and COVID-19 datasets resulted in high patient classification accuracy using only a small number of genes (<20), automatically selected from the entire transcriptome. In the COVID-19 case study, we demonstrated cross-dataset generalizability in predicting disease state in an external patient cohort. scPanel outperforms other state-of-the-art gene selection methods for patient classification and can be used to identify parsimonious sets of reliable biomarker candidates for clinical translation.
30329142	2019	Nucleic acids research	CancerSEA: a cancer single-cell state atlas.	High functional heterogeneity of cancer cells poses a major challenge for cancer research. Single-cell sequencing technology provides an unprecedented opportunity to decipher diverse functional states of cancer cells at single-cell resolution, and cancer scRNA-seq datasets have been largely accumulated. This emphasizes the urgent need to build a dedicated resource to decode the functional states of cancer single cells. Here, we developed CancerSEA (http://biocc.hrbmu.edu.cn/CancerSEA/ or http://202.97.205.69/CancerSEA/), the first dedicated database that aims to comprehensively explore distinct functional states of cancer cells at the single-cell level. CancerSEA portrays a cancer single-cell functional state atlas, involving 14 functional states (including stemness, invasion, metastasis, proliferation, EMT, angiogenesis, apoptosis, cell cycle, differentiation, DNA damage, DNA repair, hypoxia, inflammation and quiescence) of 41 900 cancer single cells from 25 cancer types. It allows querying which functional states are associated with the gene (or gene list) of interest in different cancers. CancerSEA also provides functional state-associated PCG/lncRNA repertoires across all cancers, in specific cancers, and in individual cancer single-cell datasets. In summary, CancerSEA provides a user-friendly interface for comprehensively searching, browsing, visualizing and downloading functional state activity profiles of tens of thousands of cancer single cells and the corresponding PCGs/lncRNAs expression profiles.
31744515	2019	Genome biology	Systematic comparative analysis of single-nucleotide variant detection methods from single-cell RNA sequencing data.	BACKGROUND: Systematic interrogation of single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) is one of the most promising approaches to delineate the cellular heterogeneity and phylogenetic relationships at the single-cell level. While SNV detection from abundant single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data is applicable and cost-effective in identifying expressed variants, inferring sub-clones, and deciphering genotype-phenotype linkages, there is a lack of computational methods specifically developed for SNV calling in scRNA-seq. Although variant callers for bulk RNA-seq have been sporadically used in scRNA-seq, the performances of different tools have not been assessed. RESULTS: Here, we perform a systematic comparison of seven tools including SAMtools, the GATK pipeline, CTAT, FreeBayes, MuTect2, Strelka2, and VarScan2, using both simulation and scRNA-seq datasets, and identify multiple elements influencing their performance. While the specificities are generally high, with sensitivities exceeding 90% for most tools when calling homozygous SNVs in high-confident coding regions with sufficient read depths, such sensitivities dramatically decrease when calling SNVs with low read depths, low variant allele frequencies, or in specific genomic contexts. SAMtools shows the highest sensitivity in most cases especially with low supporting reads, despite the relatively low specificity in introns or high-identity regions. Strelka2 shows consistently good performance when sufficient supporting reads are provided, while FreeBayes shows good performance in the cases of high variant allele frequencies. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend SAMtools, Strelka2, FreeBayes, or CTAT, depending on the specific conditions of usage. Our study provides the first benchmarking to evaluate the performances of different SNV detection tools for scRNA-seq data.
31400221	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Alternating EM algorithm for a bilinear model in isoform quantification from RNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: Estimation of isoform-level gene expression from RNA-seq data depends on simplifying assumptions, such as uniform read distribution, that are easily violated in real data. Such violations typically lead to biased estimates. Most existing methods provide bias correction step(s), which is based on biological considerations-such as GC content-and applied in single samples separately. The main problem is that not all biases are known. RESULTS: We have developed a novel method called XAEM based on a more flexible and robust statistical model. Existing methods are essentially based on a linear model Xbeta, where the design matrix X is known and is computed based on the simplifying assumptions. In contrast XAEM considers Xbeta as a bilinear model with both X and beta unknown. Joint estimation of X and beta is made possible by a simultaneous analysis of multi-sample RNA-seq data. Compared to existing methods, XAEM automatically performs empirical correction of potentially unknown biases. We use an alternating expectation-maximization (AEM) algorithm, alternating between estimation of X and beta. For speed XAEM utilizes quasi-mapping for read alignment, thus leading to a fast algorithm. Overall XAEM performs favorably compared to recent advanced methods. For simulated datasets, XAEM obtains higher accuracy for multiple-isoform genes. In a differential-expression analysis of a real single-cell RNA-seq dataset, XAEM achieves substantially better rediscovery rates in independent validation sets. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The method and pipeline are implemented as a tool and freely available for use at http://fafner.meb.ki.se/biostatwiki/xaem/.

30820550	2019	Nucleic acids research	A general computational approach to predicting synergistic transcriptional cores that determine cell subpopulation identities.	Advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing techniques reveal the existence of distinct cell subpopulations. Identification of transcription factors (TFs) that define the identity of these subpopulations poses a challenge. Here, we postulate that identity depends on background subpopulations, and is determined by a synergistic core combination of TFs mainly uniquely expressed in each subpopulation, but also TFs more broadly expressed across background subpopulations. Building on this view, we develop a new computational method for determining such synergistic identity cores of subpopulations within a given cell population. Our method utilizes an information-theoretic measure for quantifying transcriptional synergy, and implements a novel algorithm for searching for optimal synergistic cores. It requires only single-cell RNA-seq data as input, and does not rely on any prior knowledge of candidate genes or gene regulatory networks. Hence, it can be directly applied to any cellular systems, including those containing novel subpopulations. The method is capable of recapitulating known experimentally validated identity TFs in eight published single-cell RNA-seq datasets. Furthermore, some of these identity TFs are known to trigger cell conversions between subpopulations. Thus, this methodology can help design strategies for cell conversion within a cell population, guiding experimentalists in the field of stem cell research and regenerative medicine.
34343245	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	Network-guided identification of cancer-selective combinatorial therapies in ovarian cancer.	Each patient's cancer consists of multiple cell subpopulations that are inherently heterogeneous and may develop differing phenotypes such as drug sensitivity or resistance. A personalized treatment regimen should therefore target multiple oncoproteins in the cancer cell populations that are driving the treatment resistance or disease progression in a given patient to provide maximal therapeutic effect, while avoiding severe co-inhibition of non-malignant cells that would lead to toxic side effects. To address the intra- and inter-tumoral heterogeneity when designing combinatorial treatment regimens for cancer patients, we have implemented a machine learning-based platform to guide identification of safe and effective combinatorial treatments that selectively inhibit cancer-related dysfunctions or resistance mechanisms in individual patients. In this case study, we show how the platform enables prediction of cancer-selective drug combinations for patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer using single-cell imaging cytometry drug response assay, combined with genome-wide transcriptomic and genetic profiles. The platform makes use of drug-target interaction networks to prioritize those combinations that warrant further preclinical testing in scarce patient-derived primary cells. During the case study in ovarian cancer patients, we investigated (i) the relative performance of various ensemble learning algorithms for drug response prediction, (ii) the use of matched single-cell RNA-sequencing data to deconvolute cell population-specific transcriptome profiles from bulk RNA-seq data, (iii) and whether multi-patient or patient-specific predictive models lead to better predictive accuracy. The general platform and the comparison results are expected to become useful for future studies that use similar predictive approaches also in other cancer types.
39313645	2025	Nature biotechnology	Scalable and unsupervised discovery from raw sequencing reads using SPLASH2.	We introduce SPLASH2, a fast, scalable implementation of SPLASH based on an efficient k-mer counting approach for regulated sequence variation detection in massive datasets from a wide range of sequencing technologies and biological contexts. We demonstrate biological discovery by SPLASH2 in single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data and in bulk RNA-seq data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, including unannotated alternative splicing in cancer transcriptomes and sensitive detection of circular RNA.
31038684	2019	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Continuous-state HMMs for modeling time-series single-cell RNA-Seq data.	MOTIVATION: Methods for reconstructing developmental trajectories from time-series single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) data can be largely divided into two categories. The first, often referred to as pseudotime ordering methods are deterministic and rely on dimensionality reduction followed by an ordering step. The second learns a probabilistic branching model to represent the developmental process. While both types have been successful, each suffers from shortcomings that can impact their accuracy. RESULTS: We developed a new method based on continuous-state HMMs (CSHMMs) for representing and modeling time-series scRNA-Seq data. We define the CSHMM model and provide efficient learning and inference algorithms which allow the method to determine both the structure of the branching process and the assignment of cells to these branches. Analyzing several developmental single-cell datasets, we show that the CSHMM method accurately infers branching topology and correctly and continuously assign cells to paths, improving upon prior methods proposed for this task. Analysis of genes based on the continuous cell assignment identifies known and novel markers for different cell types. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Software and Supporting website: www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/chiehl1/CSHMM/. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
39271103	2024	Nucleic acids research	IRescue: uncertainty-aware quantification of transposable elements expression at single cell level.	Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile DNA repeats known to shape the evolution of eukaryotic genomes. In complex organisms, they exhibit tissue-specific transcription. However, understanding their role in cellular diversity across most tissues remains a challenge, when employing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), due to their widespread presence and genetic similarity. To address this, we present IRescue (Interspersed Repeats single-cell quantifier), a software capable of estimating the expression of TE subfamilies at the single-cell level. IRescue incorporates a unique UMI deduplication algorithm to rectify sequencing errors and employs an Expectation-Maximization procedure to effectively redistribute the counts of multi-mapping reads. Our study showcases the precision of IRescue through analysis of both simulated and real single cell and nuclei RNA-seq data from human colorectal cancer, brain, skin aging, and PBMCs during SARS-CoV-2 infection and recovery. By linking the expression patterns of TE signatures to specific conditions and biological contexts, we unveil insights into their potential roles in cellular heterogeneity and disease progression.
36592056	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Systematic benchmarking of statistical methods to assess differential expression of circular RNAs.	Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are covalently closed transcripts involved in critical regulatory axes, cancer pathways and disease mechanisms. CircRNA expression measured with RNA-seq has particular characteristics that might hamper the performance of standard biostatistical differential expression assessment methods (DEMs). We compared 38 DEM pipelines configured to fit circRNA expression data's statistical properties, including bulk RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and metagenomics DEMs. The DEMs performed poorly on data sets of typical size. Widely used DEMs, such as DESeq2, edgeR and Limma-Voom, gave scarce results, unreliable predictions or even contravened the expected behaviour with some parameter configurations. Limma-Voom achieved the most consistent performance throughout different benchmark data sets and, as well as SAMseq, reasonably balanced false discovery rate (FDR) and recall rate. Interestingly, a few scRNA-seq DEMs obtained results comparable with the best-performing bulk RNA-seq tools. Almost all DEMs' performance improved when increasing the number of replicates. CircRNA expression studies require careful design, choice of DEM and DEM configuration. This analysis can guide scientists in selecting the appropriate tools to investigate circRNA differential expression with RNA-seq experiments.
39082647	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Enhancer-driven gene regulatory networks inference from single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data.	Deciphering the intricate relationships between transcription factors (TFs), enhancers, and genes through the inference of enhancer-driven gene regulatory networks (eGRNs) is crucial in understanding gene regulatory programs in a complex biological system. This study introduces STREAM, a novel method that leverages a Steiner forest problem model, a hybrid biclustering pipeline, and submodular optimization to infer eGRNs from jointly profiled single-cell transcriptome and chromatin accessibility data. Compared to existing methods, STREAM demonstrates enhanced performance in terms of TF recovery, TF-enhancer linkage prediction, and enhancer-gene relation discovery. Application of STREAM to an Alzheimer's disease dataset and a diffuse small lymphocytic lymphoma dataset reveals its ability to identify TF-enhancer-gene relations associated with pseudotime, as well as key TF-enhancer-gene relations and TF cooperation underlying tumor cells.
32437538	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scTPA: a web tool for single-cell transcriptome analysis of pathway activation signatures.	MOTIVATION: At present, a fundamental challenge in single-cell RNA-sequencing data analysis is functional interpretation and annotation of cell clusters. Biological pathways in distinct cell types have different activation patterns, which facilitates the understanding of cell functions using single-cell transcriptomics. However, no effective web tool has been implemented for single-cell transcriptome data analysis based on prior biological pathway knowledge. RESULTS: Here, we present scTPA, a web-based platform for pathway-based analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data in human and mouse. scTPA incorporates four widely-used gene set enrichment methods to estimate the pathway activation scores of single cells based on a collection of available biological pathways with different functional and taxonomic classifications. The clustering analysis and cell-type-specific activation pathway identification were provided for the functional interpretation of cell types from a pathway-oriented perspective. An intuitive interface allows users to conveniently visualize and download single-cell pathway signatures. Overall, scTPA is a comprehensive tool for the identification of pathway activation signatures for the analysis of single cell heterogeneity.

34225769	2021	Genome biology	Coordinated changes in gene expression kinetics underlie both mouse and human erythroid maturation.	BACKGROUND: Single-cell technologies are transforming biomedical research, including the recent demonstration that unspliced pre-mRNA present in single-cell RNA-Seq permits prediction of future expression states. Here we apply this RNA velocity concept to an extended timecourse dataset covering mouse gastrulation and early organogenesis. RESULTS: Intriguingly, RNA velocity correctly identifies epiblast cells as the starting point, but several trajectory predictions at later stages are inconsistent with both real-time ordering and existing knowledge. The most striking discrepancy concerns red blood cell maturation, with velocity-inferred trajectories opposing the true differentiation path. Investigating the underlying causes reveals a group of genes with a coordinated step-change in transcription, thus violating the assumptions behind current velocity analysis suites, which do not accommodate time-dependent changes in expression dynamics. Using scRNA-Seq analysis of chimeric mouse embryos lacking the major erythroid regulator Gata1, we show that genes with the step-changes in expression dynamics during erythroid differentiation fail to be upregulated in the mutant cells, thus underscoring the coordination of modulating transcription rate along a differentiation trajectory. In addition to the expected block in erythroid maturation, the Gata1-chimera dataset reveals induction of PU.1 and expansion of megakaryocyte progenitors. Finally, we show that erythropoiesis in human fetal liver is similarly characterized by a coordinated step-change in gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: By identifying a limitation of the current velocity framework coupled with in vivo analysis of mutant cells, we reveal a coordinated step-change in gene expression kinetics during erythropoiesis, with likely implications for many other differentiation processes.
29140455	2018	Nucleic acids research	A sparse differential clustering algorithm for tracing cell type changes via single-cell RNA-sequencing data.	Cell types in cell populations change as the condition changes: some cell types die out, new cell types may emerge and surviving cell types evolve to adapt to the new condition. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing data that measure the gene expression of cells before and after the condition change, we propose an algorithm, SparseDC, which identifies cell types, traces their changes across conditions and identifies genes which are marker genes for these changes. By solving a unified optimization problem, SparseDC completes all three tasks simultaneously. SparseDC is highly computationally efficient and demonstrates its accuracy on both simulated and real data.
38049696	2024	Nature methods	SEVtras delineates small extracellular vesicles at droplet resolution from single-cell transcriptomes.	Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) are emerging as pivotal players in a wide range of physiological and pathological processes. However, a pressing challenge has been the lack of high-throughput techniques capable of unraveling the intricate heterogeneity of sEVs and decoding the underlying cellular behaviors governing sEV secretion. Here we leverage droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and introduce an algorithm, SEVtras, to identify sEV-containing droplets and estimate the sEV secretion activity (ESAI) of individual cells. Through extensive validations on both simulated and real datasets, we demonstrate SEVtras' efficacy in capturing sEV-containing droplets and characterizing the secretion activity of specific cell types. By applying SEVtras to four tumor scRNA-seq datasets, we further illustrate that the ESAI can serve as a potent indicator of tumor progression, particularly in the early stages. With the increasing importance and availability of scRNA-seq datasets, SEVtras holds promise in offering valuable extracellular insights into the cell heterogeneity.
38981682	2024	Genome research	Accurate estimation of pathway activity in single cells for clustering and differential analysis.	Inferring which and how biological pathways and gene sets change is a key question in many studies that utilize single-cell RNA sequencing. Typically, these questions are addressed by quantifying the enrichment of known gene sets in lists of genes derived from global analysis. Here we offer SiPSiC, a new method to infer pathway activity in every single cell. This allows more sensitive differential analysis and utilization of pathway scores to cluster cells and compute UMAP or other similar projections. We apply our method to COVID-19, lung adenocarcinoma and glioma data sets, and demonstrate its utility. SiPSiC analysis results are consistent with findings reported in previous studies in many cases, but SiPSiC also reveals the differential activity of novel pathways, enabling us to suggest new mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of these diseases and demonstrating SiPSiC's high accuracy and sensitivity in detecting biological function and traits. In addition, we demonstrate how it can be used to better classify cells based on activity of biological pathways instead of single genes and its ability to overcome patient-specific artifacts.
29262845	2017	Genome biology	Single-cell profiling of human gliomas reveals macrophage ontogeny as a basis for regional differences in macrophage activation in the tumor microenvironment.	BACKGROUND: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are abundant in gliomas and immunosuppressive TAMs are a barrier to emerging immunotherapies. It is unknown to what extent macrophages derived from peripheral blood adopt the phenotype of brain-resident microglia in pre-treatment gliomas. The relative proportions of blood-derived macrophages and microglia have been poorly quantified in clinical samples due to a paucity of markers that distinguish these cell types in malignant tissue. RESULTS: We perform single-cell RNA-sequencing of human gliomas and identify phenotypic differences in TAMs of distinct lineages. We isolate TAMs from patient biopsies and compare them with macrophages from non-malignant human tissue, glioma atlases, and murine glioma models. We present a novel signature that distinguishes TAMs by ontogeny in human gliomas. Blood-derived TAMs upregulate immunosuppressive cytokines and show an altered metabolism compared to microglial TAMs. They are also enriched in perivascular and necrotic regions. The gene signature of blood-derived TAMs, but not microglial TAMs, correlates with significantly inferior survival in low-grade glioma. Surprisingly, TAMs frequently co-express canonical pro-inflammatory (M1) and alternatively activated (M2) genes in individual cells. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that blood-derived TAMs significantly infiltrate pre-treatment gliomas, to a degree that varies by glioma subtype and tumor compartment. Blood-derived TAMs do not universally conform to the phenotype of microglia, but preferentially express immunosuppressive cytokines and show an altered metabolism. Our results argue against status quo therapeutic strategies that target TAMs indiscriminately and in favor of strategies that specifically target immunosuppressive blood-derived TAMs.
31529053	2019	Nucleic acids research	cellHarmony: cell-level matching and holistic comparison of single-cell transcriptomes.	To understand the molecular pathogenesis of human disease, precision analyses to define alterations within and between disease-associated cell populations are desperately needed. Single-cell genomics represents an ideal platform to enable the identification and comparison of normal and diseased transcriptional cell populations. We created cellHarmony, an integrated solution for the unsupervised analysis, classification, and comparison of cell types from diverse single-cell RNA-Seq datasets. cellHarmony efficiently and accurately matches single-cell transcriptomes using a community-clustering and alignment strategy to compute differences in cell-type specific gene expression over potentially dozens of cell populations. Such transcriptional differences are used to automatically identify distinct and shared gene programs among cell-types and identify impacted pathways and transcriptional regulatory networks to understand the impact of perturbations at a systems level. cellHarmony is implemented as a python package and as an integrated workflow within the software AltAnalyze. We demonstrate that cellHarmony has improved or equivalent performance to alternative label projection methods, is able to identify the likely cellular origins of malignant states, stratify patients into clinical disease subtypes from identified gene programs, resolve discrete disease networks impacting specific cell-types, and illuminate therapeutic mechanisms. Thus, this approach holds tremendous promise in revealing the molecular and cellular origins of complex disease.
36208175	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	MuSiC2: cell-type deconvolution for multi-condition bulk RNA-seq data.	Cell-type composition of intact bulk tissues can vary across samples. Deciphering cell-type composition and its changes during disease progression is an important step toward understanding disease pathogenesis. To infer cell-type composition, existing cell-type deconvolution methods for bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data often require matched single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data, generated from samples with similar clinical conditions, as reference. However, due to the difficulty of obtaining scRNA-seq data in diseased samples, only limited scRNA-seq data in matched disease conditions are available. Using scRNA-seq reference to deconvolve bulk RNA-seq data from samples with different disease conditions may lead to a biased estimation of cell-type proportions. To overcome this limitation, we propose an iterative estimation procedure, MuSiC2, which is an extension of MuSiC, to perform deconvolution analysis of bulk RNA-seq data generated from samples with multiple clinical conditions where at least one condition is different from that of the scRNA-seq reference. Extensive benchmark evaluations indicated that MuSiC2 improved the accuracy of cell-type proportion estimates of bulk RNA-seq samples under different conditions as compared with the traditional MuSiC deconvolution. MuSiC2 was applied to two bulk RNA-seq datasets for deconvolution analysis, including one from human pancreatic islets and the other from human retina. We show that MuSiC2 improves current deconvolution methods and provides more accurate cell-type proportion estimates when the bulk and single-cell reference differ in clinical conditions. We believe the condition-specific cell-type composition estimates from MuSiC2 will facilitate the downstream analysis and help identify cellular targets of human diseases.
37580132	2023	Genome research	Dissecting and improving gene regulatory network inference using single-cell transcriptome data.	Single-cell transcriptome data has been widely used to reconstruct gene regulatory networks (GRNs) controlling critical biological processes such as development and differentiation. Although a growing list of algorithms has been developed to infer GRNs using such data, achieving an inference accuracy consistently higher than random guessing has remained challenging. To address this, it is essential to delineate how the accuracy of regulatory inference is limited. Here, we systematically characterized factors limiting the accuracy of inferred GRNs and demonstrated that using pre-mRNA information can help improve regulatory inference compared to the typically used information (i.e., mature mRNA). Using kinetic modeling and simulated single-cell data sets, we showed that target genes' mature mRNA levels often fail to accurately report upstream regulatory activities because of gene-level and network-level factors, which can be improved by using pre-mRNA levels. We tested this finding on public single-cell RNA-seq data sets using intronic reads as proxies of pre-mRNA levels and can indeed achieve a higher inference accuracy compared to using exonic reads (corresponding to mature mRNAs). Using experimental data sets, we further validated findings from the simulated data sets and identified factors such as transcription factor activity dynamics influencing the accuracy of pre-mRNA-based inference. This work delineates the fundamental limitations of gene regulatory inference and helps improve GRN inference using single-cell RNA-seq data.
40001084	2025	Genome biology	Batch correcting single-cell spatial transcriptomics count data with Crescendo improves visualization and detection of spatial gene patterns.	Spatial transcriptomics facilitates gene expression analysis of cells in their spatial anatomical context. Batch effects hinder visualization of gene spatial patterns across samples. We present the Crescendo algorithm to correct for batch effects at the gene expression level and enable accurate visualization of gene expression patterns across multiple samples. We show Crescendo's utility and scalability across three datasets ranging from 170,000 to 7 million single cells across spatial and single-cell RNA sequencing technologies. By correcting for batch effects, Crescendo enhances spatial transcriptomics analyses to detect gene colocalization and ligand-receptor interactions and enables cross-technology information transfer.
30864667	2019	Nucleic acids research	Cell-specific network constructed by single-cell RNA sequencing data.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is able to give an insight into the gene-gene associations or transcriptional networks among cell populations based on the sequencing of a large number of cells. However, traditional network methods are limited to the grouped cells instead of each single cell, and thus the heterogeneity of single cells will be erased. We present a new method to construct a cell-specific network (CSN) for each single cell from scRNA-seq data (i.e. one network for one cell), which transforms the data from 'unstable' gene expression form to 'stable' gene association form on a single-cell basis. In particular, it is for the first time that we can identify the gene associations/network at a single-cell resolution level. By CSN method, scRNA-seq data can be analyzed for clustering and pseudo-trajectory from network perspective by any existing method, which opens a new way to scRNA-seq data analyses. In addition, CSN is able to find differential gene associations for each single cell, and even 'dark' genes that play important roles at the network level but are generally ignored by traditional differential gene expression analyses. In addition, CSN can be applied to construct individual network of each sample bulk RNA-seq data. Experiments on various scRNA-seq datasets validated the effectiveness of CSN in terms of accuracy and robustness.
34762642	2021	PLoS computational biology	A conserved expression signature predicts growth rate and reveals cell & lineage-specific differences.	Isogenic cells cultured together show heterogeneity in their proliferation rate. To determine the differences between fast and slow-proliferating cells, we developed a method to sort cells by proliferation rate, and performed RNA-seq on slow and fast proliferating subpopulations of pluripotent mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and mouse fibroblasts. We found that slowly proliferating mESCs have a more naive pluripotent character. We identified an evolutionarily conserved proliferation-correlated transcriptomic signature that is common to all eukaryotes: fast cells have higher expression of genes for protein synthesis and protein degradation. This signature accurately predicted growth rate in yeast and cancer cells, and identified lineage-specific proliferation dynamics during development, using C. elegans scRNA-seq data. In contrast, sorting by mitochondria membrane potential revealed a highly cell-type specific mitochondria-state related transcriptome. mESCs with hyperpolarized mitochondria are fast proliferating, while the opposite is true for fibroblasts. The mitochondrial electron transport chain inhibitor antimycin affected slow and fast subpopulations differently. While a major transcriptional-signature associated with cell-to-cell heterogeneity in proliferation is conserved, the metabolic and energetic dependency of cell proliferation is cell-type specific.
38822412	2024	Genome biology	Sequential drug treatment targeting cell cycle and cell fate regulatory programs blocks non-genetic cancer evolution in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	BACKGROUND: Targeted therapies exploiting vulnerabilities of cancer cells hold promise for improving patient outcome and reducing side-effects of chemotherapy. However, efficacy of precision therapies is limited in part because of tumor cell heterogeneity. A better mechanistic understanding of how drug effect is linked to cancer cell state diversity is crucial for identifying effective combination therapies that can prevent disease recurrence. RESULTS: Here, we characterize the effect of G2/M checkpoint inhibition in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and demonstrate that WEE1 targeted therapy impinges on cell fate decision regulatory circuits. We find the highest inhibition of recovery of proliferation in ALL cells with KMT2A-rearrangements. Single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq of RS4;11 cells harboring KMT2A::AFF1, treated with the WEE1 inhibitor AZD1775, reveal diversification of cell states, with a fraction of cells exhibiting strong activation of p53-driven processes linked to apoptosis and senescence, and disruption of a core KMT2A-RUNX1-MYC regulatory network. In this cell state diversification induced by WEE1 inhibition, a subpopulation transitions to a drug tolerant cell state characterized by activation of transcription factors regulating pre-B cell fate, lipid metabolism, and pre-BCR signaling in a reversible manner. Sequential treatment with BCR-signaling inhibitors dasatinib, ibrutinib, or perturbing metabolism by fatostatin or AZD2014 effectively counteracts drug tolerance by inducing cell death and repressing stemness markers. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our findings provide new insights into the tight connectivity of gene regulatory programs associated with cell cycle and cell fate regulation, and a rationale for sequential administration of WEE1 inhibitors with low toxicity inhibitors of pre-BCR signaling or metabolism.
29553578	2018	Nature methods	Identification of spatial expression trends in single-cell gene expression data.	As methods for measuring spatial gene expression at single-cell resolution become available, there is a need for computational analysis strategies. We present trendsceek, a method based on marked point processes that identifies genes with statistically significant spatial expression trends. trendsceek finds these genes in spatial transcriptomic and sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization data, and also reveals significant gene expression gradients and hot spots in low-dimensional projections of dissociated single-cell RNA-seq data.
37598422	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Differential variability analysis of single-cell gene expression data.	The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies has enabled gene expression profiling at the single-cell resolution, thereby enabling the quantification and comparison of transcriptional variability among individual cells. Although alterations in transcriptional variability have been observed in various biological states, statistical methods for quantifying and testing differential variability between groups of cells are still lacking. To identify the best practices in differential variability analysis of single-cell gene expression data, we propose and compare 12 statistical pipelines using different combinations of methods for normalization, feature selection, dimensionality reduction and variability calculation. Using high-quality synthetic scRNA-seq datasets, we benchmarked the proposed pipelines and found that the most powerful and accurate pipeline performs simple library size normalization, retains all genes in analysis and uses denSNE-based distances to cluster medoids as the variability measure. By applying this pipeline to scRNA-seq datasets of COVID-19 and autism patients, we have identified cellular variability changes between patients with different severity status or between patients and healthy controls.
31373345	2019	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scRNABatchQC: multi-samples quality control for single cell RNA-seq data.	SUMMARY: Single cell RNA sequencing is a revolutionary technique to characterize inter-cellular transcriptomics heterogeneity. However, the data are noise-prone because gene expression is often driven by both technical artifacts and genuine biological variations. Proper disentanglement of these two effects is critical to prevent spurious results. While several tools exist to detect and remove low-quality cells in one single cell RNA-seq dataset, there is lack of approach to examining consistency between sample sets and detecting systematic biases, batch effects and outliers. We present scRNABatchQC, an R package to compare multiple sample sets simultaneously over numerous technical and biological features, which gives valuable hints to distinguish technical artifact from biological variations. scRNABatchQC helps identify and systematically characterize sources of variability in single cell transcriptome data. The examination of consistency across datasets allows visual detection of biases and outliers. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: scRNABatchQC is freely available at https://github.com/liuqivandy/scRNABatchQC as an R package.

37428794	2023	PLoS computational biology	LRT: Integrative analysis of scRNA-seq and scTCR-seq data to investigate clonal differentiation heterogeneity.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data has been widely used for cell trajectory inference, with the assumption that cells with similar expression profiles share the same differentiation state. However, the inferred trajectory may not reveal clonal differentiation heterogeneity among T cell clones. Single-cell T cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq) data provides invaluable insights into the clonal relationship among cells, yet it lacks functional characteristics. Therefore, scRNA-seq and scTCR-seq data complement each other in improving trajectory inference, where a reliable computational tool is still missing. We developed LRT, a computational framework for the integrative analysis of scTCR-seq and scRNA-seq data to explore clonal differentiation trajectory heterogeneity. Specifically, LRT uses the transcriptomics information from scRNA-seq data to construct overall cell trajectories and then utilizes both the TCR sequence information and phenotype information to identify clonotype clusters with distinct differentiation biasedness. LRT provides a comprehensive analysis workflow, including preprocessing, cell trajectory inference, clonotype clustering, trajectory biasedness evaluation, and clonotype cluster characterization. We illustrated its utility using scRNA-seq and scTCR-seq data of CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells with acute lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection. These analyses identified several clonotype clusters with distinct skewed distribution along the differentiation path, which cannot be revealed solely based on scRNA-seq data. Clones from different clonotype clusters exhibited diverse expansion capability, V-J gene usage pattern and CDR3 motifs. The LRT framework was implemented as an R package 'LRT', and it is now publicly accessible at https://github.com/JuanXie19/LRT. In addition, it provides two Shiny apps 'shinyClone' and 'shinyClust' that allow users to interactively explore distributions of clonotypes, conduct repertoire analysis, implement clustering of clonotypes, trajectory biasedness evaluation, and clonotype cluster characterization.
31500668	2019	Genome biology	scBFA: modeling detection patterns to mitigate technical noise in large-scale single-cell genomics data.	Technical variation in feature measurements, such as gene expression and locus accessibility, is a key challenge of large-scale single-cell genomic datasets. We show that this technical variation in both scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq datasets can be mitigated by analyzing feature detection patterns alone and ignoring feature quantification measurements. This result holds when datasets have low detection noise relative to quantification noise. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of detection pattern models using our new framework, scBFA, for both cell type identification and trajectory inference. Performance gains can also be realized in one line of R code in existing pipelines.
39207727	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	A single-cell multimodal view on gene regulatory network inference from transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility data.	Eukaryotic gene regulation is a combinatorial, dynamic, and quantitative process that plays a vital role in development and disease and can be modeled at a systems level in gene regulatory networks (GRNs). The wealth of multi-omics data measured on the same samples and even on the same cells has lifted the field of GRN inference to the next stage. Combinations of (single-cell) transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility allow the prediction of fine-grained regulatory programs that go beyond mere correlation of transcription factor and target gene expression, with enhancer GRNs (eGRNs) modeling molecular interactions between transcription factors, regulatory elements, and target genes. In this review, we highlight the key components for successful (e)GRN inference from (sc)RNA-seq and (sc)ATAC-seq data exemplified by state-of-the-art methods as well as open challenges and future developments. Moreover, we address preprocessing strategies, metacell generation and computational omics pairing, transcription factor binding site detection, and linear and three-dimensional approaches to identify chromatin interactions as well as dynamic and causal eGRN inference. We believe that the integration of transcriptomics together with epigenomics data at a single-cell level is the new standard for mechanistic network inference, and that it can be further advanced with integrating additional omics layers and spatiotemporal data, as well as with shifting the focus towards more quantitative and causal modeling strategies.
37246643	2023	Nucleic acids research	Gene knockout inference with variational graph autoencoder learning single-cell gene regulatory networks.	In this paper, we introduce Gene Knockout Inference (GenKI), a virtual knockout (KO) tool for gene function prediction using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data in the absence of KO samples when only wild-type (WT) samples are available. Without using any information from real KO samples, GenKI is designed to capture shifting patterns in gene regulation caused by the KO perturbation in an unsupervised manner and provide a robust and scalable framework for gene function studies. To achieve this goal, GenKI adapts a variational graph autoencoder (VGAE) model to learn latent representations of genes and interactions between genes from the input WT scRNA-seq data and a derived single-cell gene regulatory network (scGRN). The virtual KO data is then generated by computationally removing all edges of the KO gene-the gene to be knocked out for functional study-from the scGRN. The differences between WT and virtual KO data are discerned by using their corresponding latent parameters derived from the trained VGAE model. Our simulations show that GenKI accurately approximates the perturbation profiles upon gene KO and outperforms the state-of-the-art under a series of evaluation conditions. Using publicly available scRNA-seq data sets, we demonstrate that GenKI recapitulates discoveries of real-animal KO experiments and accurately predicts cell type-specific functions of KO genes. Thus, GenKI provides an in-silico alternative to KO experiments that may partially replace the need for genetically modified animals or other genetically perturbed systems.
40839713	2025	PLoS computational biology	Improving cell-type composition inference in spatial transcriptomics with SpaDAMA.	Accurate determination of cell-type composition in disease-relevant tissues is essential for identifying potential disease targets and understanding tissue heterogeneity. Most current spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies lack single-cell resolution, which makes precise cell-type composition identification challenging. Several deconvolution methods have been developed to address this limitation by relying on single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from the same tissue as a reference to estimate the cell type composition in ST data spots. However, these methods often overlook the inherent differences between scRNA-seq and ST data. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a Domain-Adversarial Masked Autoencoder (SpaDAMA) method. SpaDAMA leverages Domain-Adversarial Learning (DAL) to facilitate effective knowledge transfer from the source domain (pseudo-ST data generated from scRNA-seq) to the target domain (real ST data). Through adversarial training, SpaDAMA harmonizes the distributions of both datasets and maps them onto a unified latent representation, thereby reducing discrepancies in data modalities. Furthermore, to strengthen the model's capability in extracting reliable features from real ST data, SpaDAMA employs masking strategies that effectively minimize noise and mitigate spatial artifacts. We validated SpaDAMA on 32 simulated datasets and 4 real-world datasets, demonstrating its superior performance in cell-type deconvolution and providing a promising tool for spatial transcriptomic analyses.
38741214	2024	Genome biology	Single-cell 3D genome structure reveals distinct human pluripotent states.	BACKGROUND: Pluripotent states of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) with distinct transcriptional profiles affect ESC differentiative capacity and therapeutic potential. Although single-cell RNA sequencing has revealed additional subpopulations and specific features of naive and primed human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), the underlying mechanisms that regulate their specific transcription and that control their pluripotent states remain elusive. RESULTS: By single-cell analysis of high-resolution, three-dimensional (3D) genomic structure, we herein demonstrate that remodeling of genomic structure is highly associated with the pluripotent states of human ESCs (hESCs). The naive pluripotent state is featured with specialized 3D genomic structures and clear chromatin compartmentalization that is distinct from the primed state. The naive pluripotent state is achieved by remodeling the active euchromatin compartment and reducing chromatin interactions at the nuclear center. This unique genomic organization is linked to enhanced chromatin accessibility on enhancers and elevated expression levels of naive pluripotent genes localized to this region. In contradistinction, the primed state exhibits intermingled genomic organization. Moreover, active euchromatin and primed pluripotent genes are distributed at the nuclear periphery, while repressive heterochromatin is densely concentrated at the nuclear center, reducing chromatin accessibility and the transcription of naive genes. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide insights into the chromatin structure of ESCs in their naive and primed states, and we identify specific patterns of modifications in transcription and chromatin structure that might explain the genes that are differentially expressed between naive and primed hESCs. Thus, the inversion or relocation of heterochromatin to euchromatin via compartmentalization is related to the regulation of chromatin accessibility, thereby defining pluripotent states and cellular identity.
35598331	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	scCODE: an R package for data-specific differentially expressed gene detection on single-cell RNA-sequencing data.	Differential expression (DE) gene detection in single-cell ribonucleic acid (RNA)-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data is a key step to understand the biological question investigated. Filtering genes is suggested to improve the performance of DE methods, but the influence of filtering genes has not been demonstrated. Furthermore, the optimal methods for different scRNA-seq datasets are divergent, and different datasets should benefit from data-specific DE gene detection strategies. However, existing tools did not take gene filtering into consideration. There is a lack of metrics for evaluating the optimal method on experimental datasets. Based on two new metrics, we propose single-cell Consensus Optimization of Differentially Expressed gene detection, an R package to automatically optimize DE gene detection for each experimental scRNA-seq dataset.
25254363	2014	PLoS computational biology	Identifying cell types from spatially referenced single-cell expression datasets.	Complex tissues, such as the brain, are composed of multiple different cell types, each of which have distinct and important roles, for example in neural function. Moreover, it has recently been appreciated that the cells that make up these sub-cell types themselves harbour significant cell-to-cell heterogeneity, in particular at the level of gene expression. The ability to study this heterogeneity has been revolutionised by advances in experimental technology, such as Wholemount in Situ Hybridizations (WiSH) and single-cell RNA-sequencing. Consequently, it is now possible to study gene expression levels in thousands of cells from the same tissue type. After generating such data one of the key goals is to cluster the cells into groups that correspond to both known and putatively novel cell types. Whilst many clustering algorithms exist, they are typically unable to incorporate information about the spatial dependence between cells within the tissue under study. When such information exists it provides important insights that should be directly included in the clustering scheme. To this end we have developed a clustering method that uses a Hidden Markov Random Field (HMRF) model to exploit both quantitative measures of expression and spatial information. To accurately reflect the underlying biology, we extend current HMRF approaches by allowing the degree of spatial coherency to differ between clusters. We demonstrate the utility of our method using simulated data before applying it to cluster single cell gene expression data generated by applying WiSH to study expression patterns in the brain of the marine annelid Platynereis dumereilii. Our approach allows known cell types to be identified as well as revealing new, previously unexplored cell types within the brain of this important model system.
31038689	2019	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	LAmbDA: label ambiguous domain adaptation dataset integration reduces batch effects and improves subtype detection.	MOTIVATION: Rapid advances in single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have produced higher-resolution cellular subtypes in multiple tissues and species. Methods are increasingly needed across datasets and species to (i) remove systematic biases, (ii) model multiple datasets with ambiguous labels and (iii) classify cells and map cell type labels. However, most methods only address one of these problems on broad cell types or simulated data using a single model type. It is also important to address higher-resolution cellular subtypes, subtype labels from multiple datasets, models trained on multiple datasets simultaneously and generalizability beyond a single model type. RESULTS: We developed a species- and dataset-independent transfer learning framework (LAmbDA) to train models on multiple datasets (even from different species) and applied our framework on simulated, pancreas and brain scRNA-seq experiments. These models mapped corresponding cell types between datasets with inconsistent cell subtype labels while simultaneously reducing batch effects. We achieved high accuracy in labeling cellular subtypes (weighted accuracy simulated 1 datasets: 90%; simulated 2 datasets: 94%; pancreas datasets: 88% and brain datasets: 66%) using LAmbDA Feedforward 1 Layer Neural Network with bagging. This method achieved higher weighted accuracy in labeling cellular subtypes than two other state-of-the-art methods, scmap and CaSTLe in brain (66% versus 60% and 32%). Furthermore, it achieved better performance in correctly predicting ambiguous cellular subtype labels across datasets in 88% of test cases compared with CaSTLe (63%), scmap (50%) and MetaNeighbor (50%). LAmbDA is model- and dataset-independent and generalizable to diverse data types representing an advance in biocomputing. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: github.com/tsteelejohnson91/LAmbDA.

29672674	2018	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	TRUmiCount: correctly counting absolute numbers of molecules using unique molecular identifiers.	MOTIVATION: Counting molecules using next-generation sequencing (NGS) suffers from PCR amplification bias, which reduces the accuracy of many quantitative NGS-based experimental methods such as RNA-Seq. This is true even if molecules are made distinguishable using unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) before PCR amplification, and distinct UMIs are counted instead of reads: Molecules that are lost entirely during the sequencing process will still cause underestimation of the molecule count, and amplification artifacts like PCR chimeras create phantom UMIs and thus cause over-estimation. RESULTS: We introduce the TRUmiCount algorithm to correct for both types of errors. The TRUmiCount algorithm is based on a mechanistic model of PCR amplification and sequencing, whose two parameters have an immediate physical interpretation as PCR efficiency and sequencing depth and can be estimated from experimental data without requiring calibration experiments or spike-ins. We show that our model captures the main stochastic properties of amplification and sequencing, and that it allows us to filter out phantom UMIs and to estimate the number of molecules lost during the sequencing process. Finally, we demonstrate that the phantom-filtered and loss-corrected molecule counts computed by TRUmiCount measure the true number of molecules with considerably higher accuracy than the raw number of distinct UMIs, even if most UMIs are sequenced only once as is typical for single-cell RNA-Seq. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: TRUmiCount is available at http://www.cibiv.at/software/trumicount and through Bioconda (http://bioconda.github.io). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary information is available at Bioinformatics online.
38844627	2024	Nature methods	Accurate and efficient integrative reference-informed spatial domain detection for spatial transcriptomics.	Spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) studies are becoming increasingly common and large, offering unprecedented opportunities in mapping complex tissue structures and functions. Here we present integrative and reference-informed tissue segmentation (IRIS), a computational method designed to characterize tissue spatial organization in SRT studies through accurately and efficiently detecting spatial domains. IRIS uniquely leverages single-cell RNA sequencing data for reference-informed detection of biologically interpretable spatial domains, integrating multiple SRT slices while explicitly considering correlations both within and across slices. We demonstrate the advantages of IRIS through in-depth analysis of six SRT datasets encompassing diverse technologies, tissues, species and resolutions. In these applications, IRIS achieves substantial accuracy gains (39-1,083%) and speed improvements (4.6-666.0) in moderate-sized datasets, while representing the only method applicable for large datasets including Stereo-seq and 10x Xenium. As a result, IRIS reveals intricate brain structures, uncovers tumor microenvironment heterogeneity and detects structural changes in diabetes-affected testis, all with exceptional speed and accuracy.
35821114	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	Propensity score matching enables batch-effect-corrected imputation in single-cell RNA-seq analysis.	Developments of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have enabled biological discoveries at the single-cell resolution with high throughput. However, large scRNA-seq datasets always suffer from massive technical noises, including batch effects and dropouts, and the dropout is often shown to be batch-dependent. Most existing methods only address one of the problems, and we show that the popularly used methods failed in trading off batch effect correction and dropout imputation. Here, inspired by the idea of causal inference, we propose a novel propensity score matching method for scRNA-seq data (scPSM) by borrowing information and taking the weighted average from similar cells in the deep sequenced batch, which simultaneously removes the batch effect, imputes dropout and denoises data in the entire gene expression space. The proposed method is testified on two simulation datasets and a variety of real scRNA-seq datasets, and the results show that scPSM is superior to other state-of-the-art methods. First, scPSM improves clustering accuracy and mixes cells of the same type, suggesting its ability to keep cell type separation while correcting for batch. Besides, using the scPSM-integrated data as input yields results free of batch effects or dropouts in the differential expression analysis. Moreover, scPSM not only achieves ideal denoising but also preserves real biological structure for downstream gene-based analyses. Furthermore, scPSM is robust to hyperparameters and small datasets with a few cells but enormous genes. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that scPSM jointly provides desirable batch effect correction, imputation and denoising for recovering the biologically meaningful expression in scRNA-seq data.
33142319	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	scAPAtrap: identification and quantification of alternative polyadenylation sites from single-cell RNA-seq data.	Alternative polyadenylation (APA) generates diverse mRNA isoforms, which contributes to transcriptome diversity and gene expression regulation by affecting mRNA stability, translation and localization in cells. The rapid development of 3' tag-based single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies, such as CEL-seq and 10x Genomics, has led to the emergence of computational methods for identifying APA sites and profiling APA dynamics at single-cell resolution. However, existing methods fail to detect the precise location of poly(A) sites or sites with low read coverage. Moreover, they rely on priori genome annotation and can only detect poly(A) sites located within or near annotated genes. Here we proposed a tool called scAPAtrap for detecting poly(A) sites at the whole genome level in individual cells from 3' tag-based scRNA-seq data. scAPAtrap incorporates peak identification and poly(A) read anchoring, enabling the identification of the precise location of poly(A) sites, even for sites with low read coverage. Moreover, scAPAtrap can identify poly(A) sites without using priori genome annotation, which helps locate novel poly(A) sites in previously overlooked regions and improve genome annotation. We compared scAPAtrap with two latest methods, scAPA and Sierra, using scRNA-seq data from different experimental technologies and species. Results show that scAPAtrap identified poly(A) sites with higher accuracy and sensitivity than competing methods and could be used to explore APA dynamics among cell types or the heterogeneous APA isoform expression in individual cells. scAPAtrap is available at https://github.com/BMILAB/scAPAtrap.
37037999	2023	Nature methods	Comparison of transformations for single-cell RNA-seq data.	The count table, a numeric matrix of genes x cells, is the basic input data structure in the analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data. A common preprocessing step is to adjust the counts for variable sampling efficiency and to transform them so that the variance is similar across the dynamic range. These steps are intended to make subsequent application of generic statistical methods more palatable. Here, we describe four transformation approaches based on the delta method, model residuals, inferred latent expression state and factor analysis. We compare their strengths and weaknesses and find that the latter three have appealing theoretical properties; however, in benchmarks using simulated and real-world data, it turns out that a rather simple approach, namely, the logarithm with a pseudo-count followed by principal-component analysis, performs as well or better than the more sophisticated alternatives. This result highlights limitations of current theoretical analysis as assessed by bottom-line performance benchmarks.
37948464	2023	PLoS computational biology	Attention-based deep clustering method for scRNA-seq cell type identification.	Single-cell sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology provides higher resolution of cellular differences than bulk RNA sequencing and reveals the heterogeneity in biological research. The analysis of scRNA-seq datasets is premised on the subpopulation assignment. When an appropriate reference is not available, such as specific marker genes and single-cell reference atlas, unsupervised clustering approaches become the predominant option. However, the inherent sparsity and high-dimensionality of scRNA-seq datasets pose specific analytical challenges to traditional clustering methods. Therefore, a various deep learning-based methods have been proposed to address these challenges. As each method improves partially, a comprehensive method needs to be proposed. In this article, we propose a novel scRNA-seq data clustering method named AttentionAE-sc (Attention fusion AutoEncoder for single-cell). Two different scRNA-seq clustering strategies are combined through an attention mechanism, that include zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB)-based methods dealing with the impact of dropout events and graph autoencoder (GAE)-based methods relying on information from neighbors to guide the dimension reduction. Based on an iterative fusion between denoising and topological embeddings, AttentionAE-sc can easily acquire clustering-friendly cell representations that similar cells are closer in the hidden embedding. Compared with several state-of-art baseline methods, AttentionAE-sc demonstrated excellent clustering performance on 16 real scRNA-seq datasets without the need to specify the number of groups. Additionally, AttentionAE-sc learned improved cell representations and exhibited enhanced stability and robustness. Furthermore, AttentionAE-sc achieved remarkable identification in a breast cancer single-cell atlas dataset and provided valuable insights into the heterogeneity among different cell subtypes.
37295843	2023	Genome research	Debiased personalized gene coexpression networks for population-scale scRNA-seq data.	Population-scale single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data sets create unique opportunities for quantifying expression variation across individuals at the gene coexpression network level. Estimation of coexpression networks is well established for bulk RNA-seq; however, single-cell measurements pose novel challenges owing to technical limitations and noise levels of this technology. Gene-gene correlation estimates from scRNA-seq tend to be severely biased toward zero for genes with low and sparse expression. Here, we present Dozer to debias gene-gene correlation estimates from scRNA-seq data sets and accurately quantify network-level variation across individuals. Dozer corrects correlation estimates in the general Poisson measurement model and provides a metric to quantify genes measured with high noise. Computational experiments establish that Dozer estimates are robust to mean expression levels of the genes and the sequencing depths of the data sets. Compared with alternatives, Dozer results in fewer false-positive edges in the coexpression networks, yields more accurate estimates of network centrality measures and modules, and improves the faithfulness of networks estimated from separate batches of the data sets. We showcase unique analyses enabled by Dozer in two population-scale scRNA-seq applications. Coexpression network-based centrality analysis of multiple differentiating human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines yields biologically coherent gene groups that are associated with iPSC differentiation efficiency. Application with population-scale scRNA-seq of oligodendrocytes from postmortem human tissues of Alzheimer's disease and controls uniquely reveals coexpression modules of innate immune response with distinct coexpression levels between the diagnoses. Dozer represents an important advance in estimating personalized coexpression networks from scRNA-seq data.
38171931	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Advancing single-cell RNA-seq data analysis through the fusion of multi-layer perceptron and graph neural network.	The advancement of single-cell sequencing technology has smoothed the ability to do biological studies at the cellular level. Nevertheless, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data presents several obstacles due to the considerable heterogeneity, sparsity and complexity. Although many machine-learning models have been devised to tackle these difficulties, there is still a need to enhance their efficiency and accuracy. Current deep learning methods often fail to fully exploit the intrinsic interconnections within cells, resulting in unsatisfactory results. Given these obstacles, we propose a unique approach for analyzing scRNA-seq data called scMPN. This methodology integrates multi-layer perceptron and graph neural network, including attention network, to execute gene imputation and cell clustering tasks. In order to evaluate the gene imputation performance of scMPN, several metrics like cosine similarity, median L1 distance and root mean square error are used. These metrics are utilized to compare the efficacy of scMPN with other existing approaches. This research utilizes criteria such as adjusted mutual information, normalized mutual information and integrity score to assess the efficacy of cell clustering across different approaches. The superiority of scMPN over current single-cell data processing techniques in cell clustering and gene imputation investigations is shown by the experimental findings obtained from four datasets with gold-standard cell labels. This observation demonstrates the efficacy of our suggested methodology in using deep learning methodologies to enhance the interpretation of scRNA-seq data.
35176138	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scGAC: a graph attentional architecture for clustering single-cell RNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: Emerging single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology empowers biological research at cellular level. One of the most crucial scRNA-seq data analyses is clustering single cells into subpopulations. However, the high variability, high sparsity and high dimensionality of scRNA-seq data pose lots of challenges for clustering analysis. Although many single-cell clustering methods have been recently developed, few of them fully exploit latent relationship among cells, thus leading to suboptimal clustering results. RESULTS: Here, we propose a novel unsupervised clustering method, scGAC (single-cell Graph Attentional Clustering), for scRNA-seq data. scGAC firstly constructs a cell graph and refines it by network denoising. Then, it learns clustering-friendly representation of cells through a graph attentional autoencoder, which propagates information across cells with different weights and captures latent relationship among cells. Finally, scGAC adopts a self-optimizing method to obtain the cell clusters. Experiments on 16 real scRNA-seq datasets show that scGAC achieves excellent performance and outperforms existing state-of-art single-cell clustering methods. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Python implementation of scGAC is available at Github (https://github.com/Joye9285/scGAC) and Figshare (https://figshare.com/articles/software/scGAC/19091348). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
38539041	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	ICARUS v3, a massively scalable web server for single-cell RNA-seq analysis of millions of cells.	MOTIVATION: In recent years, improvements in throughput of single-cell RNA-seq have resulted in a significant increase in the number of cells profiled. The generation of single-cell RNA-seq datasets comprising >1 million cells is becoming increasingly common, giving rise to demands for more efficient computational workflows. RESULTS: We present an update to our single-cell RNA-seq analysis web server application, ICARUS (available at https://launch.icarus-scrnaseq.cloud.edu.au) that allows effective analysis of large-scale single-cell RNA-seq datasets. ICARUS v3 utilizes the geometric cell sketching method to subsample cells from the overall dataset for dimensionality reduction and clustering that can be then projected to the large dataset. We then extend this functionality to select a representative subset of cells for downstream data analysis applications including differential expression analysis, gene co-expression network construction, gene regulatory network construction, trajectory analysis, cell-cell communication inference, and cell cluster associations to GWAS traits. We demonstrate analysis of single-cell RNA-seq datasets using ICARUS v3 of 1.3 million cells completed within the hour. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: ICARUS is available at https://launch.icarus-scrnaseq.cloud.edu.au.
39187683	2024	Nature methods	Inferring pattern-driving intercellular flows from single-cell and spatial transcriptomics.	From single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics (ST), one can extract high-dimensional gene expression patterns that can be described by intercellular communication networks or decoupled gene modules. These two descriptions of information flow are often assumed to occur independently. However, intercellular communication drives directed flows of information that are mediated by intracellular gene modules, in turn triggering outflows of other signals. Methodologies to describe such intercellular flows are lacking. We present FlowSig, a method that infers communication-driven intercellular flows from scRNA-seq or ST data using graphical causal modeling and conditional independence. We benchmark FlowSig using newly generated experimental cortical organoid data and synthetic data generated from mathematical modeling. We demonstrate FlowSig's utility by applying it to various studies, showing that FlowSig can capture stimulation-induced changes to paracrine signaling in pancreatic islets, demonstrate shifts in intercellular flows due to increasing COVID-19 severity and reconstruct morphogen-driven activator-inhibitor patterns in mouse embryogenesis.
40501071	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	scATD: a high-throughput and interpretable framework for single-cell cancer drug resistance prediction and biomarker identification.	Transfer learning has been widely applied to drug sensitivity prediction based on single-cell RNA sequencing, leveraging knowledge from large datasets of cancer cell lines or other sources to improve the prediction of drug responses. However, previous studies require model fine-tuning for different patient single-cell datasets, limiting their ability to meet the clinical need for high-throughput rapid prediction. In this research, we introduce single-cell Adaptive Transfer and Distillation model (scATD), a transfer learning framework leveraging large language models for high-throughput drug sensitivity prediction. Based on different large language models (scFoundation and Geneformer) and transfer strategies, scATD includes three distinct sub-models: scATD-sf, scATD-gf, and scATD-sf-dist. scATD-sf and scATD-gf employs an important bidirectional style transfer to enable predictions for new patients without model parameter training. Additionally, scATD-sf-dist uses knowledge distillation from large models to enhance prediction performance, improve efficiency, and reduce resource requirements. Benchmarking across more diverse datasets demonstrates scATD's superior accuracy, generalization and efficiency. Besides, by rigorously selecting reference background samples for feature attribution algorithms, scATD also provides more meaningful insights into the relationship between gene expression and drug resistance mechanisms. Making scATD more interpretability for addressing critical challenges in precision oncology.

"Identifying single nucleotide variants has become common practice for droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq experiments; however, presently, a pipeline does not exist to maximize variant calling accuracy. Furthermore, molecular duplicates generated in these experiments have not been utilized to optimally detect variant co-expression. Herein, we introduce scSNV designed from the ground up to ""collapse"" molecular duplicates and accurately identify variants and their co-expression. We demonstrate that scSNV is fast, with a reduced false-positive variant call rate, and enables the co-detection of genetic variants and A>G RNA edits across twenty-two samples."
32609343	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	GPress: a framework for querying general feature format (GFF) files and expression files in a compressed form.	MOTIVATION: Sequencing data are often summarized at different annotation levels for further analysis, generally using the general feature format (GFF) or its descendants, gene transfer format (GTF) and GFF3. Existing utilities for accessing these files, like gffutils and gffread, do not focus on reducing the storage space, significantly increasing it in some cases. We propose GPress, a framework for querying GFF files in a compressed form. GPress can also incorporate and compress expression files from both bulk and single-cell RNA-Seq experiments, supporting simultaneous queries on both the GFF and expression files. In brief, GPress applies transformations to the data which are then compressed with the general lossless compressor BSC. To support queries, GPress compresses the data in blocks and creates several index tables for fast retrieval. RESULTS: We tested GPress on several GFF files of different organisms, and showed that it achieves on average a 61% reduction in size with respect to gzip (the current de facto compressor for GFF files) while being able to retrieve all annotations for a given identifier or a range of coordinates in a few seconds (when run in a common laptop). In contrast, gffutils provides faster retrieval but doubles the size of the GFF files. When additionally linking an expression file, we show that GPress can reduce its size by more than 68% when compared to gzip (for both bulk and single-cell RNA-Seq experiments), while still retrieving the information within seconds. Finally, applying BSC to the data streams generated by GPress instead of to the original file shows a size reduction of more than 44% on average. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: GPress is freely available at https://github.com/qm2/gpress. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
34252925	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scPNMF: sparse gene encoding of single cells to facilitate gene selection for targeted gene profiling.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) captures whole transcriptome information of individual cells. While scRNA-seq measures thousands of genes, researchers are often interested in only dozens to hundreds of genes for a closer study. Then, a question is how to select those informative genes from scRNA-seq data. Moreover, single-cell targeted gene profiling technologies are gaining popularity for their low costs, high sensitivity and extra (e.g. spatial) information; however, they typically can only measure up to a few hundred genes. Then another challenging question is how to select genes for targeted gene profiling based on existing scRNA-seq data. RESULTS: Here, we develop the single-cell Projective Non-negative Matrix Factorization (scPNMF) method to select informative genes from scRNA-seq data in an unsupervised way. Compared with existing gene selection methods, scPNMF has two advantages. First, its selected informative genes can better distinguish cell types. Second, it enables the alignment of new targeted gene profiling data with reference data in a low-dimensional space to facilitate the prediction of cell types in the new data. Technically, scPNMF modifies the PNMF algorithm for gene selection by changing the initialization and adding a basis selection step, which selects informative bases to distinguish cell types. We demonstrate that scPNMF outperforms the state-of-the-art gene selection methods on diverse scRNA-seq datasets. Moreover, we show that scPNMF can guide the design of targeted gene profiling experiments and the cell-type annotation on targeted gene profiling data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The R package is open-access and available at https://github.com/JSB-UCLA/scPNMF. The data used in this work are available at Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4797997. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
31501864	2019	Nucleic acids research	Cell-type-specific analysis of alternative polyadenylation using single-cell transcriptomics data.	Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is emerging as an important layer of gene regulation because the majority of mammalian protein-coding genes contain multiple polyadenylation (pA) sites in their 3' UTR. By alteration of 3' UTR length, APA can considerably affect post-transcriptional gene regulation. Yet, our understanding of APA remains rudimentary. Novel single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) techniques allow molecular characterization of different cell types to an unprecedented degree. Notably, the most popular scRNA-seq protocols specifically sequence the 3' end of transcripts. Building on this property, we implemented a method for analysing patterns of APA regulation from such data. Analyzing multiple datasets from diverse tissues, we identified widespread modulation of APA in different cell types resulting in global 3' UTR shortening/lengthening and enhanced cleavage at intronic pA sites. Our results provide a proof-of-concept demonstration that the huge volume of scRNA-seq data that accumulates in the public domain offers a unique resource for the exploration of APA based on a very broad collection of cell types and biological conditions.
36548438	2022	PLoS computational biology	An individualized causal framework for learning intercellular communication networks that define microenvironments of individual tumors.	Cells within a tumor microenvironment (TME) dynamically communicate and influence each other's cellular states through an intercellular communication network (ICN). In cancers, intercellular communications underlie immune evasion mechanisms of individual tumors. We developed an individualized causal analysis framework for discovering tumor specific ICNs. Using head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tumors as a testbed, we first mined single-cell RNA-sequencing data to discover gene expression modules (GEMs) that reflect the states of transcriptomic processes within tumor and stromal single cells. By deconvoluting bulk transcriptomes of HNSCC tumors profiled by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we estimated the activation states of these transcriptomic processes in individual tumors. Finally, we applied individualized causal network learning to discover an ICN within each tumor. Our results show that cellular states of cells in TMEs are coordinated through ICNs that enable multi-way communications among epithelial, fibroblast, endothelial, and immune cells. Further analyses of individual ICNs revealed structural patterns that were shared across subsets of tumors, leading to the discovery of 4 different subtypes of networks that underlie disparate TMEs of HNSCC. Patients with distinct TMEs exhibited significantly different clinical outcomes. Our results show that the capability of estimating individual ICNs reveals heterogeneity of ICNs and sheds light on the importance of intercellular communication in impacting disease development and progression.
38493339	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	scMLC: an accurate and robust multiplex community detection method for single-cell multi-omics data.	Clustering cells based on single-cell multi-modal sequencing technologies provides an unprecedented opportunity to create high-resolution cell atlas, reveal cellular critical states and study health and diseases. However, effectively integrating different sequencing data for cell clustering remains a challenging task. Motivated by the successful application of Louvain in scRNA-seq data, we propose a single-cell multi-modal Louvain clustering framework, called scMLC, to tackle this problem. scMLC builds multiplex single- and cross-modal cell-to-cell networks to capture modal-specific and consistent information between modalities and then adopts a robust multiplex community detection method to obtain the reliable cell clusters. In comparison with 15 state-of-the-art clustering methods on seven real datasets simultaneously measuring gene expression and chromatin accessibility, scMLC achieves better accuracy and stability in most datasets. Synthetic results also indicate that the cell-network-based integration strategy of multi-omics data is superior to other strategies in terms of generalization. Moreover, scMLC is flexible and can be extended to single-cell sequencing data with more than two modalities.
38995959	2024	PLoS computational biology	Identifying cell states in single-cell RNA-seq data at statistically maximal resolution.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become a popular experimental method to study variation of gene expression within a population of cells. However, obtaining an accurate picture of the diversity of distinct gene expression states that are present in a given dataset is highly challenging because of the sparsity of the scRNA-seq data and its inhomogeneous measurement noise properties. Although a vast number of different methods is applied in the literature for clustering cells into subsets with 'similar' expression profiles, these methods generally lack rigorously specified objectives, involve multiple complex layers of normalization, filtering, feature selection, dimensionality-reduction, employ ad hoc measures of distance or similarity between cells, often ignore the known measurement noise properties of scRNA-seq measurements, and include a large number of tunable parameters. Consequently, it is virtually impossible to assign concrete biophysical meaning to the clusterings that result from these methods. Here we address the following problem: Given raw unique molecule identifier (UMI) counts of an scRNA-seq dataset, partition the cells into subsets such that the gene expression states of the cells in each subset are statistically indistinguishable, and each subset corresponds to a distinct gene expression state. That is, we aim to partition cells so as to maximally reduce the complexity of the dataset without removing any of its meaningful structure. We show that, given the known measurement noise structure of scRNA-seq data, this problem is mathematically well-defined and derive its unique solution from first principles. We have implemented this solution in a tool called Cellstates which operates directly on the raw data and automatically determines the optimal partition and cluster number, with zero tunable parameters. We show that, on synthetic datasets, Cellstates almost perfectly recovers optimal partitions. On real data, Cellstates robustly identifies subtle substructure within groups of cells that are traditionally annotated as a common cell type. Moreover, we show that the diversity of gene expression states that Cellstates identifies systematically depends on the tissue of origin and not on technical features of the experiments such as the total number of cells and total UMI count per cell. In addition to the Cellstates tool we also provide a small toolbox of software to place the identified cellstates into a hierarchical tree of higher-order clusters, to identify the most important differentially expressed genes at each branch of this hierarchy, and to visualize these results.
31201211	2019	Genome research	Single-molecule long-read sequencing reveals the chromatin basis of gene expression.	Genome-wide chromatin accessibility and nucleosome occupancy profiles have been widely investigated, while the long-range dynamics remain poorly studied at the single-cell level. Here, we present a new experimental approach, methyltransferase treatment followed by single-molecule long-read sequencing (MeSMLR-seq), for long-range mapping of nucleosomes and chromatin accessibility at single DNA molecules and thus achieve comprehensive-coverage characterization of the corresponding heterogeneity. MeSMLR-seq offers direct measurements of both nucleosome-occupied and nucleosome-evicted regions on a single DNA molecule, which is challenging for many existing methods. We applied MeSMLR-seq to haploid yeast, where single DNA molecules represent single cells, and thus we could investigate the combinatorics of many (up to 356) nucleosomes at long range in single cells. We illustrated the differential organization principles of nucleosomes surrounding the transcription start site for silent and actively transcribed genes, at the single-cell level and in the long-range scale. The heterogeneous patterns of chromatin status spanning multiple genes were phased. Together with single-cell RNA-seq data, we quantitatively revealed how chromatin accessibility correlated with gene transcription positively in a highly heterogeneous scenario. Moreover, we quantified the openness of promoters and investigated the coupled chromatin changes of adjacent genes at single DNA molecules during transcription reprogramming. In addition, we revealed the coupled changes of chromatin accessibility for two neighboring glucose transporter genes in response to changes in glucose concentration.
27470110	2016	Genome research	End Sequence Analysis Toolkit (ESAT) expands the extractable information from single-cell RNA-seq data.	RNA-seq protocols that focus on transcript termini are well suited for applications in which template quantity is limiting. Here we show that, when applied to end-sequencing data, analytical methods designed for global RNA-seq produce computational artifacts. To remedy this, we created the End Sequence Analysis Toolkit (ESAT). As a test, we first compared end-sequencing and bulk RNA-seq using RNA from dendritic cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). As predicted by the telescripting model for transcriptional bursts, ESAT detected an LPS-stimulated shift to shorter 3'-isoforms that was not evident by conventional computational methods. Then, droplet-based microfluidics was used to generate 1000 cDNA libraries, each from an individual pancreatic islet cell. ESAT identified nine distinct cell types, three distinct beta-cell types, and a complex interplay between hormone secretion and vascularization. ESAT, then, offers a much-needed and generally applicable computational pipeline for either bulk or single-cell RNA end-sequencing.
28738873	2017	Genome biology	MATCHER: manifold alignment reveals correspondence between single cell transcriptome and epigenome dynamics.	Single cell experimental techniques reveal transcriptomic and epigenetic heterogeneity among cells, but how these are related is unclear. We present MATCHER, an approach for integrating multiple types of single cell measurements. MATCHER uses manifold alignment to infer single cell multi-omic profiles from transcriptomic and epigenetic measurements performed on different cells of the same type. Using scM&T-seq and sc-GEM data, we confirm that MATCHER accurately predicts true single cell correlations between DNA methylation and gene expression without using known cell correspondences. MATCHER also reveals new insights into the dynamic interplay between the transcriptome and epigenome in single embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells.
31611697	2019	Nature biotechnology	High-throughput sequencing of the transcriptome and chromatin accessibility in the same cell.	Single-cell RNA sequencing can reveal the transcriptional state of cells, yet provides little insight into the upstream regulatory landscape associated with open or accessible chromatin regions. Joint profiling of accessible chromatin and RNA within the same cells would permit direct matching of transcriptional regulation to its outputs. Here, we describe droplet-based single-nucleus chromatin accessibility and mRNA expression sequencing (SNARE-seq), a method that can link a cell's transcriptome with its accessible chromatin for sequencing at scale. Specifically, accessible sites are captured by Tn5 transposase in permeabilized nuclei to permit, within many droplets in parallel, DNA barcode tagging together with the mRNA molecules from the same cells. To demonstrate the utility of SNARE-seq, we generated joint profiles of 5,081 and 10,309 cells from neonatal and adult mouse cerebral cortices, respectively. We reconstructed the transcriptome and epigenetic landscapes of major and rare cell types, uncovered lineage-specific accessible sites, especially for low-abundance cells, and connected the dynamics of promoter accessibility with transcription level during neurogenesis.
39116191	2024	PLoS computational biology	scRNMF: An imputation method for single-cell RNA-seq data by robust and non-negative matrix factorization.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful tool in genomics research, enabling the analysis of gene expression at the individual cell level. However, scRNA-seq data often suffer from a high rate of dropouts, where certain genes fail to be detected in specific cells due to technical limitations. This missing data can introduce biases and hinder downstream analysis. To overcome this challenge, the development of effective imputation methods has become crucial in the field of scRNA-seq data analysis. Here, we propose an imputation method based on robust and non-negative matrix factorization (scRNMF). Instead of other matrix factorization algorithms, scRNMF integrates two loss functions: L2 loss and C-loss. The L2 loss function is highly sensitive to outliers, which can introduce substantial errors. We utilize the C-loss function when dealing with zero values in the raw data. The primary advantage of the C-loss function is that it imposes a smaller punishment for larger errors, which results in more robust factorization when handling outliers. Various datasets of different sizes and zero rates are used to evaluate the performance of scRNMF against other state-of-the-art methods. Our method demonstrates its power and stability as a tool for imputation of scRNA-seq data.
34643725	2022	Nucleic acids research	CancerSCEM: a database of single-cell expression map across various human cancers.	With the proliferating studies of human cancers by single-cell RNA sequencing technique (scRNA-seq), cellular heterogeneity, immune landscape and pathogenesis within diverse cancers have been uncovered successively. The exponential explosion of massive cancer scRNA-seq datasets in the past decade are calling for a burning demand to be integrated and processed for essential investigations in tumor microenvironment of various cancer types. To fill this gap, we developed a database of Cancer Single-cell Expression Map (CancerSCEM, https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/cancerscem), particularly focusing on a variety of human cancers. To date, CancerSCE version 1.0 consists of 208 cancer samples across 28 studies and 20 human cancer types. A series of uniformly and multiscale analyses for each sample were performed, including accurate cell type annotation, functional gene expressions, cell interaction network, survival analysis and etc. Plus, we visualized CancerSCEM as a user-friendly web interface for users to browse, search, online analyze and download all the metadata as well as analytical results. More importantly and unprecedentedly, the newly-constructed comprehensive online analyzing platform in CancerSCEM integrates seven analyze functions, where investigators can interactively perform cancer scRNA-seq analyses. In all, CancerSCEM paves an informative and practical way to facilitate human cancer studies, and also provides insights into clinical therapy assessments.
35561205	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	findPC: An R package to automatically select the number of principal components in single-cell analysis.	SUMMARY: Principal component analysis is widely used in analyzing single-cell genomic data. Selecting the optimal number of principal components (PCs) is a crucial step for downstream analyses. The elbow method is most commonly used for this task, but it requires one to visually inspect the elbow plot and manually choose the elbow point. To address this limitation, we developed six methods to automatically select the optimal number of PCs based on the elbow method. We evaluated the performance of these methods on real single-cell RNA-seq data from multiple human and mouse tissues and cell types. The perpendicular line method with 30 PCs has the best overall performance, and its results are highly consistent with the numbers of PCs identified manually. We implemented the six methods in an R package, findPC, that objectively selects the number of PCs and can be easily incorporated into any automatic analysis pipeline. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: findPC R package is freely available at https://github.com/haotian-zhuang/findPC.

33772584	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Bioconductor toolchain for reproducible bioinformatics pipelines using Rcwl and RcwlPipelines.	SUMMARY: The Common Workflow Language (CWL) is used to provide portable and reproducible data analysis workflows across different tools and computing environments. We have developed Rcwl, an R interface to CWL, to provide easier development, use and maintenance of CWL pipelines from within R. We have also collected more than 100 pre-built tools and pipelines in RcwlPipelines, ready to be queried and used by researchers in their own analysis. A single-cell RNA sequencing preprocessing pipeline demonstrates use of the software.

33624750	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	ESCO: single cell expression simulation incorporating gene co-expression.	MOTIVATION: Gene-gene co-expression networks (GCN) are of biological interest for the useful information they provide for understanding gene-gene interactions. The advent of single cell RNA-sequencing allows us to examine more subtle gene co-expression occurring within a cell type. Many imputation and denoising methods have been developed to deal with the technical challenges observed in single cell data; meanwhile, several simulators have been developed for benchmarking and assessing these methods. Most of these simulators, however, either do not incorporate gene co-expression or generate co-expression in an inconvenient manner. RESULTS: Therefore, with the focus on gene co-expression, we propose a new simulator, ESCO, which adopts the idea of the copula to impose gene co-expression, while preserving the highlights of available simulators, which perform well for simulation of gene expression marginally. Using ESCO, we assess the performance of imputation methods on GCN recovery and find that imputation generally helps GCN recovery when the data are not too sparse, and the ensemble imputation method works best among leading methods. In contrast, imputation fails to help in the presence of an excessive fraction of zero counts, where simple data aggregating methods are a better choice. These findings are further verified with mouse and human brain cell data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The ESCO implementation is available as R package ESCO. Users can either download the development version via github (https://github.com/JINJINT/ESCO) or the archived version via Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/record/4455890). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
29262851	2017	Genome biology	Single-cell RNA-seq study determines the ontogeny of macrophages in glioblastomas.	A large-scale single-cell RNA-seq analysis of tumor-associated macrophages in gliomas has unveiled a new aspect of the complex tumor microenvironment and new biomarkers.
38683883	2024	PLoS computational biology	Reconstruction Set Test (RESET): A computationally efficient method for single sample gene set testing based on randomized reduced rank reconstruction error.	We have developed a new, and analytically novel, single sample gene set testing method called Reconstruction Set Test (RESET). RESET quantifies gene set importance based on the ability of set genes to reconstruct values for all measured genes. RESET is realized using a computationally efficient randomized reduced rank reconstruction algorithm (available via the RESET R package on CRAN) that can effectively detect patterns of differential abundance and differential correlation for self-contained and competitive scenarios. As demonstrated using real and simulated scRNA-seq data, RESET provides superior performance at a lower computational cost relative to other single sample approaches.
38676578	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	CopyVAE: a variational autoencoder-based approach for copy number variation inference using single-cell transcriptomics.	MOTIVATION: Copy number variations (CNVs) are common genetic alterations in tumour cells. The delineation of CNVs holds promise for enhancing our comprehension of cancer progression. Moreover, accurate inference of CNVs from single-cell sequencing data is essential for unravelling intratumoral heterogeneity. However, existing inference methods face limitations in resolution and sensitivity. RESULTS: To address these challenges, we present CopyVAE, a deep learning framework based on a variational autoencoder architecture. Through experiments, we demonstrated that CopyVAE can accurately and reliably detect CNVs from data obtained using single-cell RNA sequencing. CopyVAE surpasses existing methods in terms of sensitivity and specificity. We also discussed CopyVAE's potential to advance our understanding of genetic alterations and their impact on disease advancement. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: CopyVAE is implemented and freely available under MIT license at https://github.com/kurtsemih/copyVAE.
37414936	2024	Nature biotechnology	De novo detection of somatic mutations in high-throughput single-cell profiling data sets.	Characterization of somatic mutations at single-cell resolution is essential to study cancer evolution, clonal mosaicism and cell plasticity. Here, we describe SComatic, an algorithm designed for the detection of somatic mutations in single-cell transcriptomic and ATAC-seq (assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequence) data sets directly without requiring matched bulk or single-cell DNA sequencing data. SComatic distinguishes somatic mutations from polymorphisms, RNA-editing events and artefacts using filters and statistical tests parameterized on non-neoplastic samples. Using >2.6 million single cells from 688 single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) data sets spanning cancer and non-neoplastic samples, we show that SComatic detects mutations in single cells accurately, even in differentiated cells from polyclonal tissues that are not amenable to mutation detection using existing methods. Validated against matched genome sequencing and scRNA-seq data, SComatic achieves F1 scores between 0.6 and 0.7 across diverse data sets, in comparison to 0.2-0.4 for the second-best performing method. In summary, SComatic permits de novo mutational signature analysis, and the study of clonal heterogeneity and mutational burdens at single-cell resolution.
37498558	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Sub-Cluster Identification through Semi-Supervised Optimization of Rare-Cell Silhouettes (SCISSORS) in single-cell RNA-sequencing.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has enabled the molecular profiling of thousands to millions of cells simultaneously in biologically heterogenous samples. Currently, the common practice in scRNA-seq is to determine cell type labels through unsupervised clustering and the examination of cluster-specific genes. However, even small differences in analysis and parameter choosing can greatly alter clustering results and thus impose great influence on which cell types are identified. Existing methods largely focus on determining the optimal number of robust clusters, which can be problematic for identifying cells of extremely low abundance due to their subtle contributions toward overall patterns of gene expression. RESULTS: Here, we present a carefully designed framework, SCISSORS, which accurately profiles subclusters within broad cluster(s) for the identification of rare cell types in scRNA-seq data. SCISSORS employs silhouette scoring for the estimation of heterogeneity of clusters and reveals rare cells in heterogenous clusters by a multi-step semi-supervised reclustering process. Additionally, SCISSORS provides a method for the identification of marker genes of high specificity to the cell type. SCISSORS is wrapped around the popular Seurat R package and can be easily integrated into existing Seurat pipelines. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: SCISSORS, including source code and vignettes, are freely available at https://github.com/jr-leary7/SCISSORS.
38581422	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	HyGAnno: hybrid graph neural network-based cell type annotation for single-cell ATAC sequencing data.	Reliable cell type annotations are crucial for investigating cellular heterogeneity in single-cell omics data. Although various computational approaches have been proposed for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) annotation, high-quality cell labels are still lacking in single-cell sequencing assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (scATAC-seq) data, because of extreme sparsity and inconsistent chromatin accessibility between datasets. Here, we present a novel automated cell annotation method that transfers cell type information from a well-labeled scRNA-seq reference to an unlabeled scATAC-seq target, via a parallel graph neural network, in a semi-supervised manner. Unlike existing methods that utilize only gene expression or gene activity features, HyGAnno leverages genome-wide accessibility peak features to facilitate the training process. In addition, HyGAnno reconstructs a reference-target cell graph to detect cells with low prediction reliability, according to their specific graph connectivity patterns. HyGAnno was assessed across various datasets, showcasing its strengths in precise cell annotation, generating interpretable cell embeddings, robustness to noisy reference data and adaptability to tumor tissues.
33704425	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	DCI: learning causal differences between gene regulatory networks.	SUMMARY: Designing interventions to control gene regulation necessitates modeling a gene regulatory network by a causal graph. Currently, large-scale gene expression datasets from different conditions, cell types, disease states, and developmental time points are being collected. However, application of classical causal inference algorithms to infer gene regulatory networks based on such data is still challenging, requiring high sample sizes and computational resources. Here, we describe an algorithm that efficiently learns the differences in gene regulatory mechanisms between different conditions. Our difference causal inference (DCI) algorithm infers changes (i.e. edges that appeared, disappeared, or changed weight) between two causal graphs given gene expression data from the two conditions. This algorithm is efficient in its use of samples and computation since it infers the differences between causal graphs directly without estimating each possibly large causal graph separately. We provide a user-friendly Python implementation of DCI and also enable the user to learn the most robust difference causal graph across different tuning parameters via stability selection. Finally, we show how to apply DCI to single-cell RNA-seq data from different conditions and cell states, and we also validate our algorithm by predicting the effects of interventions. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Python package freely available at http://uhlerlab.github.io/causaldag/dci. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
37864296	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Screening single-cell trajectories via continuity assessments for cell transition potential.	Advances in single-cell sequencing and data analysis have made it possible to infer biological trajectories spanning heterogeneous cell populations based on transcriptome variation. These trajectories yield a wealth of novel insights into dynamic processes such as development and differentiation. However, trajectory analysis relies on an assumption of trajectory continuity, and experimental limitations preclude some real-world scenarios from meeting this condition. The current lack of assessment metrics makes it difficult to ascertain if/when a given trajectory deviates from continuity, and what impact such a divergence would have on inference accuracy is unclear. By analyzing simulated breaks introduced into in silico and real single-cell data, we found that discontinuity caused precipitous drops in the accuracy of trajectory inference. We then generate a simple scoring algorithm for assessing trajectory continuity, and found that continuity assessments in real-world cases of intestinal stem cell development and CD8 + T cells differentiation efficiently identifies trajectories consistent with empirical knowledge. This assessment approach can also be used in cases where a priori knowledge is lacking to screen a pool of inferred lineages for their adherence to presumed continuity, and serve as a means for weighing higher likelihood trajectories for validation via empirical studies, as exemplified by our case studies in psoriatic arthritis and acute kidney injury. This tool is freely available through github at qingshanni/scEGRET.
36168811	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	dynDeepDRIM: a dynamic deep learning model to infer direct regulatory interactions using time-course single-cell gene expression data.	Time-course single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data have been widely used to explore dynamic changes in gene expression of transcription factors (TFs) and their target genes. This information is useful to reconstruct cell-type-specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs). However, the existing tools are commonly designed to analyze either time-course bulk gene expression data or static scRNA-seq data via pseudo-time cell ordering. A few methods successfully utilize the information from multiple time points while also considering the characteristics of scRNA-seq data. We proposed dynDeepDRIM, a novel deep learning model to reconstruct GRNs using time-course scRNA-seq data. It represents the joint expression of a gene pair as an image and utilizes the image of the target TF-gene pair and the ones of the potential neighbors to reconstruct GRNs from time-course scRNA-seq data. dynDeepDRIM can effectively remove the transitive TF-gene interactions by considering neighborhood context and model the gene expression dynamics using high-dimensional tensors. We compared dynDeepDRIM with six GRN reconstruction methods on both simulation and four real time-course scRNA-seq data. dynDeepDRIM achieved substantially better performance than the other methods in inferring TF-gene interactions and eliminated the false positives effectively. We also applied dynDeepDRIM to annotate gene functions and found it achieved evidently better performance than the other tools due to considering the neighbor genes.
38096269	2023	PLoS computational biology	Unravelling cancer subtype-specific driver genes in single-cell transcriptomics data with CSDGI.	Cancer is known as a heterogeneous disease. Cancer driver genes (CDGs) need to be inferred for understanding tumor heterogeneity in cancer. However, the existing computational methods have identified many common CDGs. A key challenge exploring cancer progression is to infer cancer subtype-specific driver genes (CSDGs), which provides guidane for the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of cancer. The significant advancements in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have opened up new possibilities for studying human cancers at the individual cell level. In this study, we develop a novel unsupervised method, CSDGI (Cancer Subtype-specific Driver Gene Inference), which applies Encoder-Decoder-Framework consisting of low-rank residual neural networks to inferring driver genes corresponding to potential cancer subtypes at the single-cell level. To infer CSDGs, we apply CSDGI to the tumor single-cell transcriptomics data. To filter the redundant genes before driver gene inference, we perform the differential expression genes (DEGs). The experimental results demonstrate CSDGI is effective to infer driver genes that are cancer subtype-specific. Functional and disease enrichment analysis shows these inferred CSDGs indicate the key biological processes and disease pathways. CSDGI is the first method to explore cancer driver genes at the cancer subtype level. We believe that it can be a useful method to understand the mechanisms of cell transformation driving tumours.
41101775	2025	Nucleic acids research	Using single-cell perturbation screens to decode the regulatory architecture of splicing factor programs.	Splicing factors shape the isoform pool of most transcribed genes, playing a critical role in cellular physiology. Their dysregulation is a hallmark of diseases like cancer, where aberrant splicing contributes to progression. While exon inclusion signatures accurately assess changes in splicing factor activity, systematically mapping disease-driver regulatory interactions at large scale remains challenging. Perturb-seq, which combines CRISPR-based perturbations with single-cell RNA sequencing, enables high-throughput measurement of perturbed gene expression signatures but lacks exon-level resolution, limiting its application for splicing factor activity analysis. Here, we show that shallow artificial neural networks can estimate splicing factor activity from gene expression signatures, bypassing the need for exon-level data. As a case study, we map the genetic interactions regulating splicing factors during carcinogenesis, using the shift in splicing program activity-where oncogenic-like splicing factors become more active than tumor suppressor-like factors-as a molecular reporter of a Perturb-seq screen. Our analysis reveals a cross-regulatory network among splicing factors, involving protein-protein and splicing-mediated interactions, with MYC and additional candidate pathways linking cancer driver mutations to splicing regulation. This regulation recapitulates splicing program dynamics during development. Altogether, we establish a versatile framework for studying splicing factor regulation and demonstrate its utility for uncovering disease mechanisms.
40811017	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Simulating paired and longitudinal single-cell RNA sequencing data with rescueSim.	MOTIVATION: As single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) becomes more widely used in transcriptomic research, complex experimental designs, such as paired or longitudinal studies, become increasingly feasible. Paired/longitudinal scRNA-seq enables the study of transcriptomic changes over time within specific cell types, yet guidance on analytical approaches and resources for study planning, such as power analysis, remains limited. Data simulation is a valuable tool for evaluating analysis method performance and informing study design decisions, including sample size selection. Currently, most scRNA-seq simulation methods simulate cells for a single sample, thus ignoring the between-sample and between-subject variability inherent to paired/longitudinal scRNA-seq data. RESULTS: Here, we introduce rescueSim (REpeated measures Single Cell RNA-seqUEncing data SIMulation), a novel method that simulates paired/longitudinal scRNA-seq data using a gamma-Poisson framework and incorporates additional variability between samples and subjects. We demonstrate our method's ability to reproduce important data properties and demonstrate its application in study planning. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: rescueSim is implemented as an R package and is available at https://github.com/ewynn610/rescueSim.
39516853	2024	Genome biology	scDOT: optimal transport for mapping senescent cells in spatial transcriptomics.	The low resolution of spatial transcriptomics data necessitates additional information for optimal use. We developed scDOT, which combines spatial transcriptomics and single cell RNA sequencing to improve the ability to reconstruct single cell resolved spatial maps and identify senescent cells. scDOT integrates optimal transport and expression deconvolution to learn non-linear couplings between cells and spots and to infer cell placements. Application of scDOT to lung spatial transcriptomics data improves on prior methods and allows the identification of the spatial organization of senescent cells, their neighboring cells and novel genes involved in cell-cell interactions that may be driving senescence.
40623818	2025	Genome research	Batch correction methods used in single-cell RNA sequencing analyses are often poorly calibrated.	As the number of experiments that employ single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) grows, it opens up the possibility of combining results across experiments or processing cells from the same experiment assayed in separate sequencing runs. The gain in the number of cells that can be compared comes at the cost of batch effects that may be present. Several methods have been proposed to combat this for scRNA-seq data sets. We compare eight widely used methods used for batch correction of scRNA-seq data sets. We present a novel approach to measure the degree to which the methods alter the data in the process of batch correction, both at the fine scale, comparing distances between cells, as well as measuring effects observed across clusters of cells. We demonstrate that many of the published methods are poorly calibrated in the sense that the process of correction creates measurable artifacts in the data. In particular, MNN, SCVI, and LIGER perform poorly in our tests, often altering the data considerably. Batch correction with Combat, ComBat-seq, BBKNN, and Seurat introduces artifacts that could be detected in our setup. However, we find that Harmony is the only method that consistently performs well in all the testing methodology we present. Therefore, Harmony is the only method we recommend using when performing batch correction of scRNA-seq data.
39614111	2025	Nature methods	Integrative mapping of human CD8(+) T cells in inflammation and cancer.	CD8(+) T cells exhibit remarkable phenotypic diversity in inflammation and cancer. However, a comprehensive understanding of their clonal landscape and dynamics remains elusive. Here we introduce scAtlasVAE, a deep-learning-based model for the integration of large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing data and cross-atlas comparisons. scAtlasVAE has enabled us to construct an extensive human CD8(+) T cell atlas, comprising 1,151,678 cells from 961 samples across 68 studies and 42 disease conditions, with paired T cell receptor information. Through incorporating information in T cell receptor clonal expansion and sharing, we have successfully established connections between distinct cell subtypes and shed light on their phenotypic and functional transitions. Notably, our approach characterizes three distinct exhausted T cell subtypes and reveals diverse transcriptome and clonal sharing patterns in autoimmune and immune-related adverse event inflammation. Furthermore, scAtlasVAE facilitates the automatic annotation of CD8(+) T cell subtypes in query single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, enabling unbiased and scalable analyses. In conclusion, our work presents a comprehensive single-cell reference and computational framework for CD8(+) T cell research.

37173746	2023	Genome biology	Cross-phyla protein annotation by structural prediction and alignment.	BACKGROUND: Protein annotation is a major goal in molecular biology, yet experimentally determined knowledge is typically limited to a few model organisms. In non-model species, the sequence-based prediction of gene orthology can be used to infer protein identity; however, this approach loses predictive power at longer evolutionary distances. Here we propose a workflow for protein annotation using structural similarity, exploiting the fact that similar protein structures often reflect homology and are more conserved than protein sequences. RESULTS: We propose a workflow of openly available tools for the functional annotation of proteins via structural similarity (MorF: MorphologFinder) and use it to annotate the complete proteome of a sponge. Sponges are highly relevant for inferring the early history of animals, yet their proteomes remain sparsely annotated. MorF accurately predicts the functions of proteins with known homology in [Formula: see text] cases and annotates an additional [Formula: see text] of the proteome beyond standard sequence-based methods. We uncover new functions for sponge cell types, including extensive FGF, TGF, and Ephrin signaling in sponge epithelia, and redox metabolism and control in myopeptidocytes. Notably, we also annotate genes specific to the enigmatic sponge mesocytes, proposing they function to digest cell walls. CONCLUSIONS: Our work demonstrates that structural similarity is a powerful approach that complements and extends sequence similarity searches to identify homologous proteins over long evolutionary distances. We anticipate this will be a powerful approach that boosts discovery in numerous -omics datasets, especially for non-model organisms.
37624916	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Cell-connectivity-guided trajectory inference from single-cell data.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA-sequencing enables cell-level investigation of cell differentiation, which can be modelled using trajectory inference methods. While tremendous effort has been put into designing these methods, inferring accurate trajectories automatically remains difficult. Therefore, the standard approach involves testing different trajectory inference methods and picking the trajectory giving the most biologically sensible model. As the default parameters are often suboptimal, their tuning requires methodological expertise. RESULTS: We introduce Totem, an open-source, easy-to-use R package designed to facilitate inference of tree-shaped trajectories from single-cell data. Totem generates a large number of clustering results, estimates their topologies as minimum spanning trees, and uses them to measure the connectivity of the cells. Besides automatic selection of an appropriate trajectory, cell connectivity enables to visually pinpoint branching points and milestones relevant to the trajectory.

37540223	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	ProtoCell4P: an explainable prototype-based neural network for patient classification using single-cell RNA-seq.	MOTIVATION: The rapid advance in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology over the past decade has provided a rich resource of gene expression profiles of single cells measured on patients, facilitating the study of many biological questions at the single-cell level. One intriguing research is to study the single cells which play critical roles in the phenotypes of patients, which has the potential to identify those cells and genes driving the disease phenotypes. To this end, deep learning models are expected to well encode the single-cell information and achieve precise prediction of patients' phenotypes using scRNA-seq data. However, we are facing critical challenges in designing deep learning models for classifying patient samples due to (i) the samples collected in the same dataset contain a variable number of cells-some samples might only have hundreds of cells sequenced while others could have thousands of cells, and (ii) the number of samples available is typically small and the expression profile of each cell is noisy and extremely high-dimensional. Moreover, the black-box nature of existing deep learning models makes it difficult for the researchers to interpret the models and extract useful knowledge from them. RESULTS: We propose a prototype-based and cell-informed model for patient phenotype classification, termed ProtoCell4P, that can alleviate problems of the sample scarcity and the diverse number of cells by leveraging the cell knowledge with representatives of cells (called prototypes), and precisely classify the patients by adaptively incorporating information from different cells. Moreover, this classification process can be explicitly interpreted by identifying the key cells for decision making and by further summarizing the knowledge of cell types to unravel the biological nature of the classification. Our approach is explainable at the single-cell resolution which can identify the key cells in each patient's classification. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can effectively deal with patient classifications using single-cell data and outperforms the existing approaches. Furthermore, our approach is able to uncover the association between cell types and biological classes of interest from a data-driven perspective.

31504185	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Tissue-specific deconvolution of immune cell composition by integrating bulk and single-cell transcriptomes.	MOTIVATION: Many methods have been developed to estimate immune cell composition from tissue transcriptomes. One common characteristic of these methods is that they are trained using a set of general immune cell transcriptomes that ignores tissue specificities. However, as immune cells are localized in different tissues, they may have distinct expression profiles. Hence, calculations that use general signature matrices may hinder the deconvolution accuracy. RESULTS: This study used single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data from different mouse tissues instead of general signature expression values to generate tissue-specific signature gene matrices that are used as the input of the deconvolution model. First, the transcriptome of immune cells in each tissue was extracted from scRNA-Seq data and used to construct the entire expression matrix of tissue immune cells. Then, after comparing different gene selection strategies, the expressions of 162 seq-ImmuCC derived signature genes in tissue immune cell scRNA-Seq data were regarded as the tissue specific signature matrices. Finally, a modest improvement in performance was observed in multiple tissues that refer to a traditional general signature matrix in the deconvolution model. With the fast accumulation of scRNA-Seq data, the introduction of these data into an estimation of immune cell compositions for different tissues will open a new window for avoiding tissue bias for immune cell expression. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The signature matrices were available at https://github.com/wuaipinglab/ImmuCC/tree/master/tissue_immucc/SignatureMatrix). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
40082610	2025	Nature methods	Feature selection methods affect the performance of scRNA-seq data integration and querying.	The availability of single-cell transcriptomics has allowed the construction of reference cell atlases, but their usefulness depends on the quality of dataset integration and the ability to map new samples. Previous benchmarks have compared integration methods and suggest that feature selection improves performance but have not explored how best to select features. Here, we benchmark feature selection methods for single-cell RNA sequencing integration using metrics beyond batch correction and preservation of biological variation to assess query mapping, label transfer and the detection of unseen populations. We reinforce common practice by showing that highly variable feature selection is effective for producing high-quality integrations and provide further guidance on the effect of the number of features selected, batch-aware feature selection, lineage-specific feature selection and integration and the interaction between feature selection and integration models. These results are informative for analysts working on large-scale tissue atlases, using atlases or integrating their own data to tackle specific biological questions.
39694816	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	scDCA: deciphering the dominant cell communication assembly of downstream functional events from single-cell RNA-seq data.	Cell-cell communications (CCCs) involve signaling from multiple sender cells that collectively impact downstream functional processes in receiver cells. Currently, computational methods are lacking for quantifying the contribution of pairwise combinations of cell types to specific functional processes in receiver cells (e.g. target gene expression or cell states). This limitation has impeded understanding the underlying mechanisms of cancer progression and identifying potential therapeutic targets. Here, we proposed a deep learning-based method, scDCA, to decipher the dominant cell communication assembly (DCA) that have a higher impact on a particular functional event in receiver cells from single-cell RNA-seq data. Specifically, scDCA employed a multi-view graph convolution network to reconstruct the CCCs landscape at single-cell resolution, and then identified DCA by interpreting the model with the attention mechanism. Taking the samples from advanced renal cell carcinoma as a case study, the scDCA was successfully applied and validated in revealing the DCA affecting the crucial gene expression in immune cells. The scDCA was also applied and validated in revealing the DCA responsible for the variation of 14 typical functional states of malignant cells. Furthermore, the scDCA was applied and validated to explore the alteration of CCCs under clinical intervention by comparing the DCA for certain cytotoxic factors between patients with and without immunotherapy. In summary, scDCA provides a valuable and practical tool for deciphering the cell type combinations with the most dominant impact on a specific functional process of receiver cells, which is of great significance for precise cancer treatment. Our data and code are free available at a public GitHub repository: https://github.com/pengsl-lab/scDCA.git.
35768836	2022	Genome biology	Bookend: precise transcript reconstruction with end-guided assembly.	We developed Bookend, a package for transcript assembly that incorporates data from different RNA-seq techniques, with a focus on identifying and utilizing RNA 5' and 3' ends. We demonstrate that correct identification of transcript start and end sites is essential for precise full-length transcript assembly. Utilization of end-labeled reads present in full-length single-cell RNA-seq datasets dramatically improves the precision of transcript assembly in single cells. Finally, we show that hybrid assembly across short-read, long-read, and end-capture RNA-seq datasets from Arabidopsis thaliana, as well as meta-assembly of RNA-seq from single mouse embryonic stem cells, can produce reference-quality end-to-end transcript annotations.
39878215	2025	Nucleic acids research	Telomemore enables single-cell analysis of cell cycle and chromatin condensation.	Single-cell RNA-seq methods can be used to delineate cell types and states at unprecedented resolution but do little to explain why certain genes are expressed. Single-cell ATAC-seq and multiome (ATAC + RNA) have emerged to give a complementary view of the cell state. It is however unclear what additional information can be extracted from ATAC-seq data besides transcription factor binding sites. Here, we show that ATAC-seq telomere-like reads counter-inituively cannot be used to infer telomere length, as they mostly originate from the subtelomere, but can be used as a biomarker for chromatin condensation. Using long-read sequencing, we further show that modern hyperactive Tn5 does not duplicate 9 bp of its target sequence, contrary to common belief. We provide a new tool, Telomemore, which can quantify nonaligning subtelomeric reads. By analyzing several public datasets and generating new multiome fibroblast and B-cell atlases, we show how this new readout can aid single-cell data interpretation. We show how drivers of condensation processes can be inferred, and how it complements common RNA-seq-based cell cycle inference, which fails for monocytes. Telomemore-based analysis of the condensation state is thus a valuable complement to the single-cell analysis toolbox.
32731885	2020	Genome biology	GMM-Demux: sample demultiplexing, multiplet detection, experiment planning, and novel cell-type verification in single cell sequencing.	Identifying and removing multiplets are essential to improving the scalability and the reliability of single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Multiplets create artificial cell types in the dataset. We propose a Gaussian mixture model-based multiplet identification method, GMM-Demux. GMM-Demux accurately identifies and removes multiplets through sample barcoding, including cell hashing and MULTI-seq. GMM-Demux uses a droplet formation model to authenticate putative cell types discovered from a scRNA-seq dataset. We generate two in-house cell-hashing datasets and compared GMM-Demux against three state-of-the-art sample barcoding classifiers. We show that GMM-Demux is stable and highly accurate and recognizes 9 multiplet-induced fake cell types in a PBMC dataset.
32363378	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	Computational methods for the integrative analysis of single-cell data.	Recent advances in single-cell technologies are providing exciting opportunities for dissecting tissue heterogeneity and investigating cell identity, fate and function. This is a pristine, exploding field that is flooding biologists with a new wave of data, each with its own specificities in terms of complexity and information content. The integrative analysis of genomic data, collected at different molecular layers from diverse cell populations, holds promise to address the full-scale complexity of biological systems. However, the combination of different single-cell genomic signals is computationally challenging, as these data are intrinsically heterogeneous for experimental, technical and biological reasons. Here, we describe the computational methods for the integrative analysis of single-cell genomic data, with a focus on the integration of single-cell RNA sequencing datasets and on the joint analysis of multimodal signals from individual cells.
34864871	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	Matrix factorization for biomedical link prediction and scRNA-seq data imputation: an empirical survey.	Advances in high-throughput experimental technologies promote the accumulation of vast number of biomedical data. Biomedical link prediction and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data imputation are two essential tasks in biomedical data analyses, which can facilitate various downstream studies and gain insights into the mechanisms of complex diseases. Both tasks can be transformed into matrix completion problems. For a variety of matrix completion tasks, matrix factorization has shown promising performance. However, the sparseness and high dimensionality of biomedical networks and scRNA-seq data have raised new challenges. To resolve these issues, various matrix factorization methods have emerged recently. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review on such matrix factorization methods and their usage in biomedical link prediction and scRNA-seq data imputation. Moreover, we select representative matrix factorization methods and conduct a systematic empirical comparison on 15 real data sets to evaluate their performance under different scenarios. By summarizing the experimental results, we provide general guidelines for selecting matrix factorization methods for different biomedical matrix completion tasks and point out some future directions to further improve the performance for biomedical link prediction and scRNA-seq data imputation.
40549685	2025	PLoS computational biology	MitoTracer facilitates the identification of informative mitochondrial mutations for precise lineage reconstruction.	"Mitochondrial (MT) mutations serve as natural genetic markers for inferring clonal relationships using single cell sequencing data. However, the fundamental challenge of MT mutation-based lineage tracing is automated identification of informative MT mutations. Here, we introduced an open-source computational algorithm called ""MitoTracer"", which accurately identified clonally informative MT mutations and inferred evolutionary lineage from scRNA-seq or scATAC-seq samples. We benchmarked MitoTracer using the ground-truth experimental lineage sequencing data and demonstrated its superior performance over the existing methods measured by high sensitivity and specificity. MitoTracer is compatible with multiple single cell sequencing platforms. Its application to a cancer evolution dataset revealed the genes related to primary BRAF-inhibitor resistance from scRNA-seq data of BRAF-mutated cancer cells. Overall, our work provided a valuable tool for capturing real informative MT mutations and tracing the lineages among cells."
31501851	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Spectrum: fast density-aware spectral clustering for single and multi-omic data.	MOTIVATION: Clustering patient omic data is integral to developing precision medicine because it allows the identification of disease subtypes. A current major challenge is the integration multi-omic data to identify a shared structure and reduce noise. Cluster analysis is also increasingly applied on single-omic data, for example, in single cell RNA-seq analysis for clustering the transcriptomes of individual cells. This technology has clinical implications. Our motivation was therefore to develop a flexible and effective spectral clustering tool for both single and multi-omic data. RESULTS: We present Spectrum, a new spectral clustering method for complex omic data. Spectrum uses a self-tuning density-aware kernel we developed that enhances the similarity between points that share common nearest neighbours. It uses a tensor product graph data integration and diffusion procedure to reduce noise and reveal underlying structures. Spectrum contains a new method for finding the optimal number of clusters (K) involving eigenvector distribution analysis. Spectrum can automatically find K for both Gaussian and non-Gaussian structures. We demonstrate across 21 real expression datasets that Spectrum gives improved runtimes and better clustering results relative to other methods. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Spectrum is available as an R software package from CRAN https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Spectrum/index.html. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
34196686	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	CStreet: a computed Cell State trajectory inference method for time-series single-cell RNA sequencing data.	MOTIVATION: The increasing amount of time-series single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data raises the key issue of connecting cell states (i.e. cell clusters or cell types) to obtain the continuous temporal dynamics of transcription, which can highlight the unified biological mechanisms involved in cell state transitions. However, most existing trajectory methods are specifically designed for individual cells, so they can hardly meet the needs of accurately inferring the trajectory topology of the cell state, which usually contains cells assigned to different branches. RESULTS: Here, we present CStreet, a computed Cell State trajectory inference method for time-series scRNA-seq data. It uses time-series information to construct the k-nearest neighbor connections between cells within each time point and between adjacent time points. Then, CStreet estimates the connection probabilities of the cell states and visualizes the trajectory, which may include multiple starting points and paths, using a force-directed graph. By comparing the performance of CStreet with that of six commonly used cell state trajectory reconstruction methods on simulated data and real data, we demonstrate the high accuracy and high tolerance of CStreet. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: CStreet is written in Python and freely available on the web at https://github.com/TongjiZhanglab/CStreet and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4483205. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
34871374	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Hubness reduction improves clustering and trajectory inference in single-cell transcriptomic data.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNAseq) datasets are characterized by large ambient dimensionality, and their analyses can be affected by various manifestations of the dimensionality curse. One of these manifestations is the hubness phenomenon, i.e. existence of data points with surprisingly large incoming connectivity degree in the datapoint neighbourhood graph. Conventional approach to dampen the unwanted effects of high dimension consists in applying drastic dimensionality reduction. It remains unexplored if this step can be avoided thus retaining more information than contained in the low-dimensional projections, by correcting directly hubness. RESULTS: We investigated hubness in scRNAseq data. We show that hub cells do not represent any visible technical or biological bias. The effect of various hubness reduction methods is investigated with respect to the clustering, trajectory inference and visualization tasks in scRNAseq datasets. We show that hubness reduction generates neighbourhood graphs with properties more suitable for applying machine learning methods; and that it outperforms other state-of-the-art methods for improving neighbourhood graphs. As a consequence, clustering, trajectory inference and visualization perform better, especially for datasets characterized by large intrinsic dimensionality. Hubness is an important phenomenon characterizing data point neighbourhood graphs computed for various types of sequencing datasets. Reducing hubness can be beneficial for the analysis of scRNAseq data with large intrinsic dimensionality in which case it can be an alternative to drastic dimensionality reduction. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The code used to analyze the datasets and produce the figures of this article is available from https://github.com/sysbio-curie/schubness. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
37875977	2023	Genome biology	Benchmarking algorithms for joint integration of unpaired and paired single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data.	BACKGROUND: Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) measures gene expression in single cells, while single-nucleus ATAC-sequencing (snATAC-seq) quantifies chromatin accessibility in single nuclei. These two data types provide complementary information for deciphering cell types and states. However, when analyzed individually, they sometimes produce conflicting results regarding cell type/state assignment. The power is compromised since the two modalities reflect the same underlying biology. Recently, it has become possible to measure both gene expression and chromatin accessibility from the same nucleus. Such paired data enable the direct modeling of the relationships between the two modalities. Given the availability of the vast amount of single-modality data, it is desirable to integrate the paired and unpaired single-modality datasets to gain a comprehensive view of the cellular complexity. RESULTS: We benchmark nine existing single-cell multi-omic data integration methods. Specifically, we evaluate to what extent the multiome data provide additional guidance for analyzing the existing single-modality data, and whether these methods uncover peak-gene associations from single-modality data. Our results indicate that multiome data are helpful for annotating single-modality data. However, we emphasize that the availability of an adequate number of nuclei in the multiome dataset is crucial for achieving accurate cell type annotation. Insufficient representation of nuclei may compromise the reliability of the annotations. Additionally, when generating a multiome dataset, the number of cells is more important than sequencing depth for cell type annotation. CONCLUSIONS: Seurat v4 is the best currently available platform for integrating scRNA-seq, snATAC-seq, and multiome data even in the presence of complex batch effects.
31721764	2019	PLoS computational biology	Quantifying pluripotency landscape of cell differentiation from scRNA-seq data by continuous birth-death process.	Modeling cell differentiation from omics data is an essential problem in systems biology research. Although many algorithms have been established to analyze scRNA-seq data, approaches to infer the pseudo-time of cells or quantify their potency have not yet been satisfactorily solved. Here, we propose the Landscape of Differentiation Dynamics (LDD) method, which calculates cell potentials and constructs their differentiation landscape by a continuous birth-death process from scRNA-seq data. From the viewpoint of stochastic dynamics, we exploited the features of the differentiation process and quantified the differentiation landscape based on the source-sink diffusion process. In comparison with other scRNA-seq methods in seven benchmark datasets, we found that LDD could accurately and efficiently build the evolution tree of cells with pseudo-time, in particular quantifying their differentiation landscape in terms of potency. This study provides not only a computational tool to quantify cell potency or the Waddington potential landscape based on scRNA-seq data, but also novel insights to understand the cell differentiation process from a dynamic perspective.
39468724	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Differential expression and co-expression reveal cell types relevant to genetic disorder phenotypes.	MOTIVATION: Knowledge of the specific cell types affected by genetic alterations in rare diseases is crucial for advancing diagnostics and treatments. Despite significant progress, the cell types involved in the majority of rare disease manifestations remain largely unknown. In this study, we integrated scRNA-seq data from non-diseased samples with known genetic disorder genes and phenotypic information to predict the specific cell types disrupted by pathogenic mutations for 482 disease phenotypes. RESULTS: We found significant phenotype-cell type associations focusing on differential expression and co-expression mechanisms. Our analysis revealed that 13% of the associations documented in the literature were captured through differential expression, while 42% were elucidated through co-expression analysis, also uncovering potential new associations. These findings underscore the critical role of cellular context in disease manifestation and highlight the potential of single-cell data for the development of cell-aware diagnostics and targeted therapies for rare diseases. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: All code generated in this work is available at https://github.com/SergioAlias/sc-coex.
34953465	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	An integrated brain-specific network identifies genes associated with neuropathologic and clinical traits of Alzheimer's disease.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) has a strong genetic predisposition. However, its risk genes remain incompletely identified. We developed an Alzheimer's brain gene network-based approach to predict AD-associated genes by leveraging the functional pattern of known AD-associated genes. Our constructed network outperformed existing networks in predicting AD genes. We then systematically validated the predictions using independent genetic, transcriptomic, proteomic data, neuropathological and clinical data. First, top-ranked genes were enriched in AD-associated pathways. Second, using external gene expression data from the Mount Sinai Brain Bank study, we found that the top-ranked genes were significantly associated with neuropathological and clinical traits, including the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease score, Braak stage score and clinical dementia rating. The analysis of Alzheimer's brain single-cell RNA-seq data revealed cell-type-specific association of predicted genes with early pathology of AD. Third, by interrogating proteomic data in the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project and Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging studies, we observed a significant association of protein expression level with cognitive function and AD clinical severity. The network, method and predictions could become a valuable resource to advance the identification of risk genes for AD.
31028395	2019	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Cell-level somatic mutation detection from single-cell RNA sequencing.	MOTIVATION: Both single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq) have been applied for cell-level genomic profiling. For mutation profiling, the latter seems more natural. However, the task is highly challenging due to the limited input materials from only two copies of DNA molecules, while whole-genome amplification generates biases and other technical noises. ScRNA-seq starts with a higher input amount, so generally has better data quality. There exists various methods for mutation detection from DNA sequencing, it is not clear whether these methods work for scRNA-seq data. RESULTS: Mutation detection methods developed for either bulk-cell sequencing data or scDNA-seq data do not work well for the scRNA-seq data, as they produce substantial numbers of false positives. We develop a novel and robust statistical method-called SCmut-to identify specific cells that harbor mutations discovered in bulk-cell data. Statistically SCmut controls the false positives using the 2D local false discovery rate method. We apply SCmut to several scRNA-seq datasets. In scRNA-seq breast cancer datasets SCmut identifies a number of highly confident cell-level mutations that are recurrent in many cells and consistent in different samples. In a scRNA-seq glioblastoma dataset, we discover a recurrent cell-level mutation in the PDGFRA gene that is highly correlated with a well-known in-frame deletion in the gene. To conclude, this study contributes a novel method to discover cell-level mutation information from scRNA-seq that can facilitate investigation of cell-to-cell heterogeneity. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source codes and bioinformatics pipeline of SCmut are available at https://github.com/nghiavtr/SCmut. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
37442575	2023	Genome research	Genetic control of the dynamic transcriptional response to immune stimuli and glucocorticoids at single-cell resolution.	Synthetic glucocorticoids, such as dexamethasone, have been used as a treatment for many immune conditions, such as asthma and, more recently, severe COVID-19. Single-cell data can capture more fine-grained details on transcriptional variability and dynamics to gain a better understanding of the molecular underpinnings of inter-individual variation in drug response. Here, we used single-cell RNA-seq to study the dynamics of the transcriptional response to glucocorticoids in activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 96 African American children. We used novel statistical approaches to calculate a mean-independent measure of gene expression variability and a measure of transcriptional response pseudotime. Using these approaches, we showed that glucocorticoids reverse the effects of immune stimulation on both gene expression mean and variability. Our novel measure of gene expression response dynamics, based on the diagonal linear discriminant analysis, separated individual cells by response status on the basis of their transcriptional profiles and allowed us to identify different dynamic patterns of gene expression along the response pseudotime. We identified genetic variants regulating gene expression mean and variability, including treatment-specific effects, and showed widespread genetic regulation of the transcriptional dynamics of the gene expression response.
33663567	2021	Genome biology	Pluripotent stem cell-derived models of neurological diseases reveal early transcriptional heterogeneity.	BACKGROUND: Many neurodegenerative diseases develop only later in life, when cells in the nervous system lose their structure or function. In many forms of neurodegenerative diseases, this late-onset phenomenon remains largely unexplained. RESULTS: Analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing from Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Huntington's disease (HD) patients, we find increased transcriptional heterogeneity in disease-state neurons. We hypothesize that transcriptional heterogeneity precedes neurodegenerative disease pathologies. To test this idea experimentally, we use juvenile forms (72Q; 180Q) of HD iPSCs, differentiate them into committed neuronal progenitors, and obtain single-cell expression profiles. We show a global increase in gene expression variability in HD. Autophagy genes become more stable, while energy and actin-related genes become more variable in the mutant cells. Knocking down several differentially variable genes results in increased aggregate formation, a pathology associated with HD. We further validate the increased transcriptional heterogeneity in CHD8+/- cells, a model for autism spectrum disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our results suggest that although neurodegenerative diseases develop over time, transcriptional regulation imbalance is present already at very early developmental stages. Therefore, an intervention aimed at this early phenotype may be of high diagnostic value.
31329830	2020	Briefings in bioinformatics	Single-cell transcriptome-based multilayer network biomarker for predicting prognosis and therapeutic response of gliomas.	Occurrence and development of cancers are governed by complex networks of interacting intercellular and intracellular signals. The technology of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides an unprecedented opportunity for dissecting the interplay between the cancer cells and the associated microenvironment. Here we combined scRNA-seq data with clinical bulk gene expression data to develop a computational pipeline for identifying the prognostic and predictive signature that connects cancer cells and microenvironmental cells. The pipeline was applied to glioma scRNA-seq data and revealed a tumor-associated microglia/macrophage-mediated EGFR/ERBB2 feedback-crosstalk signaling module, which was defined as a multilayer network biomarker (MNB) to predict survival outcome and therapeutic response of glioma patients. We used publicly available clinical data sets from large cohorts of glioma patients to examine the prognostic significance and predictive accuracy of the MNB, which outperformed conventional gene biomarkers and other methods. Additionally, the MNB was found to be predictive of the sensitivity or resistance of glioma patients to molecularly targeted therapeutics. Moreover, the MNB was an independent and the strongest prognostic factor when adjusted for clinicopathologic risk factors and other existing gene signatures. The robustness of the MNB was further tested on additional data sets. Our study presents a promising scRNA-seq transcriptome-based multilayer network approach to elucidate the interactions between tumor cell and tumor-associated microenvironment and to identify prognostic and predictive signatures of cancer patients. The proposed MNB method may facilitate the design of more effective biomarkers for predicting prognosis and therapeutic resistance of cancer patients.
38366243	2024	Nature methods	Toward universal cell embeddings: integrating single-cell RNA-seq datasets across species with SATURN.	Analysis of single-cell datasets generated from diverse organisms offers unprecedented opportunities to unravel fundamental evolutionary processes of conservation and diversification of cell types. However, interspecies genomic differences limit the joint analysis of cross-species datasets to homologous genes. Here we present SATURN, a deep learning method for learning universal cell embeddings that encodes genes' biological properties using protein language models. By coupling protein embeddings from language models with RNA expression, SATURN integrates datasets profiled from different species regardless of their genomic similarity. SATURN can detect functionally related genes coexpressed across species, redefining differential expression for cross-species analysis. Applying SATURN to three species whole-organism atlases and frog and zebrafish embryogenesis datasets, we show that SATURN can effectively transfer annotations across species, even when they are evolutionarily remote. We also demonstrate that SATURN can be used to find potentially divergent gene functions between glaucoma-associated genes in humans and four other species.
37697330	2023	Genome biology	ZINBMM: a general mixture model for simultaneous clustering and gene selection using single-cell transcriptomic data.	Clustering is a critical component of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis and can help reveal cell types and infer cell lineages. Despite considerable successes, there are few methods tailored to investigating cluster-specific genes contributing to cell heterogeneity, which can promote biological understanding of cell heterogeneity. In this study, we propose a zero-inflated negative binomial mixture model (ZINBMM) that simultaneously achieves effective scRNA-seq data clustering and gene selection. ZINBMM conducts a systemic analysis on raw counts, accommodating both batch effects and dropout events. Simulations and the analysis of five scRNA-seq datasets demonstrate the practical applicability of ZINBMM.

38237908	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scKWARN: Kernel-weighted-average robust normalization for single-cell RNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA-seq normalization is an essential step to correct unwanted biases caused by sequencing depth, capture efficiency, dropout, and other technical factors. Existing normalization methods primarily reduce biases arising from sequencing depth by modeling count-depth relationship and/or assuming a specific distribution for read counts. However, these methods may lead to over or under-correction due to presence of technical biases beyond sequencing depth and the restrictive assumption on models and distributions. RESULTS: We present scKWARN, a Kernel Weighted Average Robust Normalization designed to correct known or hidden technical confounders without assuming specific data distributions or count-depth relationships. scKWARN generates a pseudo expression profile for each cell by borrowing information from its fuzzy technical neighbors through a kernel smoother. It then compares this profile against the reference derived from cells with the same bimodality patterns to determine the normalization factor. As demonstrated in both simulated and real datasets, scKWARN outperforms existing methods in removing a variety of technical biases while preserving true biological heterogeneity. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: scKWARN is freely available at https://github.com/cyhsuTN/scKWARN.
39550222	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Robust self-supervised learning strategy to tackle the inherent sparsity in single-cell RNA-seq data.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool for elucidating cellular heterogeneity and tissue function in various biological contexts. However, the sparsity in scRNA-seq data limits the accuracy of cell type annotation and transcriptomic analysis due to information loss. To address this limitation, we present scRobust, a robust self-supervised learning strategy to tackle the inherent sparsity of scRNA-seq data. Built upon the Transformer architecture, scRobust employs a novel self-supervised learning strategy comprising contrastive learning and gene expression prediction tasks. We demonstrated the effectiveness of scRobust using nine benchmarks, additional dropout scenarios, and combined datasets. scRobust outperformed recent methods in cell-type annotation tasks and generated cell embeddings that capture multi-faceted clustering information (e.g. cell types and HbA1c levels). In addition, cell embeddings of scRobust were useful for detecting specific marker genes related to drug tolerance stages. Furthermore, when we applied scRobust to scATAC-seq data, high-quality cell embedding vectors were generated. These results demonstrate the representational power of scRobust.
36284317	2022	Genome biology	ReadZS detects cell type-specific and developmentally regulated RNA processing programs in single-cell RNA-seq.	RNA processing, including splicing and alternative polyadenylation, is crucial to gene function and regulation, but methods to detect RNA processing from single-cell RNA sequencing data are limited by reliance on pre-existing annotations, peak calling heuristics, and collapsing measurements by cell type. We introduce ReadZS, an annotation-free statistical approach to identify regulated RNA processing in single cells. ReadZS discovers cell type-specific RNA processing in human lung and conserved, developmentally regulated RNA processing in mammalian spermatogenesis-including global 3' UTR shortening in human spermatogenesis. ReadZS also discovers global 3' UTR lengthening in Arabidopsis development, highlighting the usefulness of this method in under-annotated transcriptomes.
35984287	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scWMC: weighted matrix completion-based imputation of scRNA-seq data via prior subspace information.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) can provide insight into gene expression patterns at the resolution of individual cells, which offers new opportunities to study the behavior of different cell types. However, it is often plagued by dropout events, a phenomenon where the expression value of a gene tends to be measured as zero in the expression matrix due to various technical defects. RESULTS: In this article, we argue that borrowing gene and cell information across column and row subspaces directly results in suboptimal solutions due to the noise contamination in imputing dropout values. Thus, to impute more precisely the dropout events in scRNA-seq data, we develop a regularization for leveraging that imperfect prior information to estimate the true underlying prior subspace and then embed it in a typical low-rank matrix completion-based framework, named scWMC. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we conduct comprehensive experiments on simulated and real scRNA-seq data. Extensive data analysis, including simulated analysis, cell clustering, differential expression analysis, functional genomic analysis, cell trajectory inference and scalability analysis, demonstrate that our method produces improved imputation results compared to competing methods that benefits subsequent downstream analysis.

38950178	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	DeepGSEA: explainable deep gene set enrichment analysis for single-cell transcriptomic data.	MOTIVATION: Gene set enrichment (GSE) analysis allows for an interpretation of gene expression through pre-defined gene set databases and is a critical step in understanding different phenotypes. With the rapid development of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology, GSE analysis can be performed on fine-grained gene expression data to gain a nuanced understanding of phenotypes of interest. However, with the cellular heterogeneity in single-cell gene profiles, current statistical GSE analysis methods sometimes fail to identify enriched gene sets. Meanwhile, deep learning has gained traction in applications like clustering and trajectory inference in single-cell studies due to its prowess in capturing complex data patterns. However, its use in GSE analysis remains limited, due to interpretability challenges. RESULTS: In this paper, we present DeepGSEA, an explainable deep gene set enrichment analysis approach which leverages the expressiveness of interpretable, prototype-based neural networks to provide an in-depth analysis of GSE. DeepGSEA learns the ability to capture GSE information through our designed classification tasks, and significance tests can be performed on each gene set, enabling the identification of enriched sets. The underlying distribution of a gene set learned by DeepGSEA can be explicitly visualized using the encoded cell and cellular prototype embeddings. We demonstrate the performance of DeepGSEA over commonly used GSE analysis methods by examining their sensitivity and specificity with four simulation studies. In addition, we test our model on three real scRNA-seq datasets and illustrate the interpretability of DeepGSEA by showing how its results can be explained.

41099605	2025	Nucleic acids research	LnCeVar 2.0: an updated resource and web tools for genomic variations disrupting ceRNA networks from single-cell/spatial transcriptomics data.	LnCeVar 2.0 (available at http://bio-bigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/LnCeVar or http://www.bio-bigdata.net/LnCeVar) is an updated database investigating genomic variations that disrupt competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks via single-cell and spatial transcriptomics. Enhancements include expanded data and improved features: (i) 16 937 experimentally supported cancer biomarkers as well as 5785 validated ceRNA interactions and single nucleotide variant (SNV)-ceRNA events, manually curated and linked to key cancer pathogenic processes; (ii) 812 single-cell RNA sequencing/spatial transcriptomics RNA sequencing datasets covering 102 diseases, clinical treatments (e.g. chemotherapy, immunotherapy), and normal tissues; (iii) 5 218 062 single-cell- and spatial-specific SNV-ceRNA events across 2 673 603 cells/spots, with cellular functional perturbation networks; (iv) 5 comprehensive and 12 mini tools for multilevel cross talk analysis and 3D visualization; and (v) novel inference of SNV effects on cell types, states, and functions at single-cell and spatial levels. LnCeVar 2.0 features a user-friendly interface for searching, browsing, and analyzing data. For instance, the CeVarState interface illustrates how SNV-ceRNA events influence cell states during developmental processes, revealing interactions that determine cell fate. The CeVarSC3D and CeVarST3D tools perform multilevel cross talk analyses of SNVs, ceRNA networks, and cell states in disease pathology, providing interactive 3D visualizations. Overall, we anticipate that the updated database will facilitate the high-resolution investigation of SNV-ceRNA networks and advance our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms in complex disease ecosystems.
35271564	2022	PLoS computational biology	A copula based topology preserving graph convolution network for clustering of single-cell RNA-seq data.	Annotation of cells in single-cell clustering requires a homogeneous grouping of cell populations. There are various issues in single cell sequencing that effect homogeneous grouping (clustering) of cells, such as small amount of starting RNA, limited per-cell sequenced reads, cell-to-cell variability due to cell-cycle, cellular morphology, and variable reagent concentrations. Moreover, single cell data is susceptible to technical noise, which affects the quality of genes (or features) selected/extracted prior to clustering. Here we introduce sc-CGconv (copula based graph convolution network for single clustering), a stepwise robust unsupervised feature extraction and clustering approach that formulates and aggregates cell-cell relationships using copula correlation (Ccor), followed by a graph convolution network based clustering approach. sc-CGconv formulates a cell-cell graph using Ccor that is learned by a graph-based artificial intelligence model, graph convolution network. The learned representation (low dimensional embedding) is utilized for cell clustering. sc-CGconv features the following advantages. a. sc-CGconv works with substantially smaller sample sizes to identify homogeneous clusters. b. sc-CGconv can model the expression co-variability of a large number of genes, thereby outperforming state-of-the-art gene selection/extraction methods for clustering. c. sc-CGconv preserves the cell-to-cell variability within the selected gene set by constructing a cell-cell graph through copula correlation measure. d. sc-CGconv provides a topology-preserving embedding of cells in low dimensional space.
29724792	2018	Genome research	bigSCale: an analytical framework for big-scale single-cell data.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has significantly deepened our insights into complex tissues, with the latest techniques capable of processing tens of thousands of cells simultaneously. Analyzing increasing numbers of cells, however, generates extremely large data sets, extending processing time and challenging computing resources. Current scRNA-seq analysis tools are not designed to interrogate large data sets and often lack sensitivity to identify marker genes. With bigSCale, we provide a scalable analytical framework to analyze millions of cells, which addresses the challenges associated with large data sets. To handle the noise and sparsity of scRNA-seq data, bigSCale uses large sample sizes to estimate an accurate numerical model of noise. The framework further includes modules for differential expression analysis, cell clustering, and marker identification. A directed convolution strategy allows processing of extremely large data sets, while preserving transcript information from individual cells. We evaluated the performance of bigSCale using both a biological model of aberrant gene expression in patient-derived neuronal progenitor cells and simulated data sets, which underlines the speed and accuracy in differential expression analysis. To test its applicability for large data sets, we applied bigSCale to assess 1.3 million cells from the mouse developing forebrain. Its directed down-sampling strategy accumulates information from single cells into index cell transcriptomes, thereby defining cellular clusters with improved resolution. Accordingly, index cell clusters identified rare populations, such as reelin (Reln)-positive Cajal-Retzius neurons, for which we report previously unrecognized heterogeneity associated with distinct differentiation stages, spatial organization, and cellular function. Together, bigSCale presents a solution to address future challenges of large single-cell data sets.
33287869	2020	Genome biology	Single-cell transcriptome profiling of an adult human cell atlas of 15 major organs.	BACKGROUND: As core units of organ tissues, cells of various types play their harmonious rhythms to maintain the homeostasis of the human body. It is essential to identify the characteristics of cells in human organs and their regulatory networks for understanding the biological mechanisms related to health and disease. However, a systematic and comprehensive single-cell transcriptional profile across multiple organs of a normal human adult is missing. RESULTS: We perform single-cell transcriptomes of 84,363 cells derived from 15 tissue organs of one adult donor and generate an adult human cell atlas. The adult human cell atlas depicts 252 subtypes of cells, including major cell types such as T, B, myeloid, epithelial, and stromal cells, as well as novel COCH(+) fibroblasts and FibSmo cells, each of which is distinguished by multiple marker genes and transcriptional profiles. These collectively contribute to the heterogeneity of major human organs. Moreover, T cell and B cell receptor repertoire comparisons and trajectory analyses reveal direct clonal sharing of T and B cells with various developmental states among different tissues. Furthermore, novel cell markers, transcription factors, and ligand-receptor pairs are identified with potential functional regulations in maintaining the homeostasis of human cells among tissues. CONCLUSIONS: The adult human cell atlas reveals the inter- and intra-organ heterogeneity of cell characteristics and provides a useful resource in uncovering key events during the development of human diseases in the context of the heterogeneity of cells and organs.
41104806	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Numbat-multiome: inferring copy number variations by combining RNA and chromatin accessibility information from single-cell data.	Aberrant alterations in genome copy number, chromatin accessibility, and transcriptional programs all play pivotal roles in cancer. The Numbat algorithm has been widely adopted to perform copy number variation (CNV) inference from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Here, we introduce Numbat-multiome that extends the capabilities of Numbat to perform CNV inference from both scRNA-seq and accessible chromatin profiles (through single-cell Assay of Transposase [Tn5]-Accessible Chromatin sequencing [scATAC-seq] data), either separately or in an integrated manner. Our approach unifies data originating from different modalities through a binning strategy that relies on a common genomic coordinate system across modalities. We demonstrate the tool's robust performance in four running modes (RNA gene, RNA bin, ATAC bin, and Combined bin) using benchmark cohorts of tumors with dynamic changes in expression patterns and copy number heterogeneity, including early-stage multiple myeloma and Richter's syndrome arising from chronic lymphocytic leukemia, validated against whole-genome sequencing. Numbat-multiome achieves high precision and recall (median F1>0.9) across different CNV event types, with consistent performance across sample types and event lengths. The tool's ability to track clonal evolution in serial samples and identify rare subclones allows for integration of epigenomic profiles at the subclonal level, providing new insights into the stepwise genetic and epigenetic changes underlying cancer phenotypic shifts.
32348450	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	PRIME: a probabilistic imputation method to reduce dropout effects in single-cell RNA sequencing.	SUMMARY: Single-cell RNA sequencing technology provides a novel means to analyze the transcriptomic profiles of individual cells. The technique is vulnerable, however, to a type of noise called dropout effects, which lead to zero-inflated distributions in the transcriptome profile and reduce the reliability of the results. Single-cell RNA sequencing data, therefore, need to be carefully processed before in-depth analysis. Here, we describe a novel imputation method that reduces dropout effects in single-cell sequencing. We construct a cell correspondence network and adjust gene expression estimates based on transcriptome profiles for the local subnetwork of cells of the same type. We comprehensively evaluated this method, called PRIME (PRobabilistic IMputation to reduce dropout effects in Expression profiles of single-cell sequencing), on synthetic and eight real single-cell sequencing datasets and verified that it improves the quality of visualization and accuracy of clustering analysis and can discover gene expression patterns hidden by noise. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code for the proposed method is freely available at https://github.com/hyundoo/PRIME. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
33244588	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Ultra-fast scalable estimation of single-cell differentiation potency from scRNA-Seq data.	MOTIVATION: An important task in the analysis of single-cell RNA-Seq data is the estimation of differentiation potency, as this can help identify stem-or-multipotent cells in non-temporal studies or in tissues where differentiation hierarchies are not well established. A key challenge in the estimation of single-cell potency is the need for a fast and accurate algorithm, scalable to large scRNA-Seq studies profiling millions of cells. RESULTS: Here, we present a single-cell potency measure, called Correlation of Connectome and Transcriptome (CCAT), which can return accurate single-cell potency estimates of a million cells in minutes, a 100-fold improvement over current state-of-the-art methods. We benchmark CCAT against 8 other single-cell potency models and across 28 scRNA-Seq studies, encompassing over 2 million cells, demonstrating comparable accuracy than the current state-of-the-art, at a significantly reduced computational cost, and with increased robustness to dropouts. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: CCAT is part of the SCENT R-package, freely available from https://github.com/aet21/SCENT. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
40991328	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Assessing tissue-specific gene expression of essential genes from human and mouse.	A gene is defined as essential when its functional loss compromises an organism's viability. Identifying essential genes is critical for identifying the components that regulate a biological system. Advances in gene editing techniques like CRISPR-Cas9 provide a capacity to interrogate a genome to elucidate the genes that are essential. However, these techniques are often applied for a single-cell line and rarely probed at a level of a tissue or organ. The recent availability of large-scale single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) atlases provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate essential gene expression in a more comprehensive context. Our study leverages information from benchmarking datasets, single-cell tissue atlases, and databases of essential genes, to develop a method, scEssentials, that uses a statistical framework to investigate the robustness and specificity of essential genes across multiple cell types. Using scEssentials, mouse and human models showed consistently high expression and exhibited limited variability across more than 60 cell types. We demonstrate a substantial number of significantly correlated gene pairs that produce densely connected co-expression networks with functional annotation. Finally, we develop a score to quantify the relative essentiality of genes within scEssentials, further validating their significant association with gene mutation frequency and chromatin accessibility. Using ageing as an application, we demonstrate how scEssentials identifies robust gene expression profiles. Only one-fifth of scEssentials genes showed significant ageing-related differential expression among age groups. Collectively, the robustness of scEssentials serves as a reference for analysing scRNA-seq data and provides insight into the heterogeneous nature such as ageing.
34320202	2021	Nucleic acids research	RCA2: a scalable supervised clustering algorithm that reduces batch effects in scRNA-seq data.	The transcriptomic diversity of cell types in the human body can be analysed in unprecedented detail using single cell (SC) technologies. Unsupervised clustering of SC transcriptomes, which is the default technique for defining cell types, is prone to group cells by technical, rather than biological, variation. Compared to de-novo (unsupervised) clustering, we demonstrate using multiple benchmarks that supervised clustering, which uses reference transcriptomes as a guide, is robust to batch effects and data quality artifacts. Here, we present RCA2, the first algorithm to combine reference projection (batch effect robustness) with graph-based clustering (scalability). In addition, RCA2 provides a user-friendly framework incorporating multiple commonly used downstream analysis modules. RCA2 also provides new reference panels for human and mouse and supports generation of custom panels. Furthermore, RCA2 facilitates cell type-specific QC, which is essential for accurate clustering of data from heterogeneous tissues. We demonstrate the advantages of RCA2 on SC data from human bone marrow, healthy PBMCs and PBMCs from COVID-19 patients. Scalable supervised clustering methods such as RCA2 will facilitate unified analysis of cohort-scale SC datasets.
38770716	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Error modelled gene expression analysis (EMOGEA) provides a superior overview of time course RNA-seq measurements and low count gene expression.	Temporal RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) studies of bulk samples provide an opportunity for improved understanding of gene regulation during dynamic phenomena such as development, tumor progression or response to an incremental dose of a pharmacotherapeutic. Moreover, single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data implicitly exhibit temporal characteristics because gene expression values recapitulate dynamic processes such as cellular transitions. Unfortunately, temporal RNA-seq data continue to be analyzed by methods that ignore this ordinal structure and yield results that are often difficult to interpret. Here, we present Error Modelled Gene Expression Analysis (EMOGEA), a framework for analyzing RNA-seq data that incorporates measurement uncertainty, while introducing a special formulation for those acquired to monitor dynamic phenomena. This method is specifically suited for RNA-seq studies in which low-count transcripts with small-fold changes lead to significant biological effects. Such transcripts include genes involved in signaling and non-coding RNAs that inherently exhibit low levels of expression. Using simulation studies, we show that this framework down-weights samples that exhibit extreme responses such as batch effects allowing them to be modeled with the rest of the samples and maintain the degrees of freedom originally envisioned for a study. Using temporal experimental data, we demonstrate the framework by extracting a cascade of gene expression waves from a well-designed RNA-seq study of zebrafish embryogenesis and an scRNA-seq study of mouse pre-implantation and provide unique biological insights into the regulation of genes in each wave. For non-ordinal measurements, we show that EMOGEA has a much higher rate of true positive calls and a vanishingly small rate of false negative discoveries compared to common approaches. Finally, we provide two packages in Python and R that are self-contained and easy to use, including test data.
28088763	2017	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Scater: pre-processing, quality control, normalization and visualization of single-cell RNA-seq data in R.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is increasingly used to study gene expression at the level of individual cells. However, preparing raw sequence data for further analysis is not a straightforward process. Biases, artifacts and other sources of unwanted variation are present in the data, requiring substantial time and effort to be spent on pre-processing, quality control (QC) and normalization. RESULTS: We have developed the R/Bioconductor package scater to facilitate rigorous pre-processing, quality control, normalization and visualization of scRNA-seq data. The package provides a convenient, flexible workflow to process raw sequencing reads into a high-quality expression dataset ready for downstream analysis. scater provides a rich suite of plotting tools for single-cell data and a flexible data structure that is compatible with existing tools and can be used as infrastructure for future software development. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The open-source code, along with installation instructions, vignettes and case studies, is available through Bioconductor at http://bioconductor.org/packages/scater .

37991248	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Transfer learning for clustering single-cell RNA-seq data crossing-species and batch, case on uterine fibroids.	Due to the high dimensionality and sparsity of the gene expression matrix in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, coupled with significant noise generated by shallow sequencing, it poses a great challenge for cell clustering methods. While numerous computational methods have been proposed, the majority of existing approaches center on processing the target dataset itself. This approach disregards the wealth of knowledge present within other species and batches of scRNA-seq data. In light of this, our paper proposes a novel method named graph-based deep embedding clustering (GDEC) that leverages transfer learning across species and batches. GDEC integrates graph convolutional networks, effectively overcoming the challenges posed by sparse gene expression matrices. Additionally, the incorporation of DEC in GDEC enables the partitioning of cell clusters within a lower-dimensional space, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of noise on clustering outcomes. GDEC constructs a model based on existing scRNA-seq datasets and then applying transfer learning techniques to fine-tune the model using a limited amount of prior knowledge gleaned from the target dataset. This empowers GDEC to adeptly cluster scRNA-seq data cross different species and batches. Through cross-species and cross-batch clustering experiments, we conducted a comparative analysis between GDEC and conventional packages. Furthermore, we implemented GDEC on the scRNA-seq data of uterine fibroids. Compared results obtained from the Seurat package, GDEC unveiled a novel cell type (epithelial cells) and identified a notable number of new pathways among various cell types, thus underscoring the enhanced analytical capabilities of GDEC. Availability and implementation: https://github.com/YuzhiSun/GDEC/tree/main.
36727460	2023	Nucleic acids research	Species-specific regulation of XIST by the JPX/FTX orthologs.	X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is an essential process, yet it initiates with remarkable diversity in various mammalian species. XIST, the main trigger of XCI, is controlled in the mouse by an interplay of lncRNA genes (LRGs), some of which evolved concomitantly to XIST and have orthologues across all placental mammals. Here, we addressed the functional conservation of human orthologues of two such LRGs, FTX and JPX. By combining analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data from early human embryogenesis with various functional assays in matched human and mouse pluripotent stem- or differentiated post-XCI cells, we demonstrate major functional differences for these orthologues between species, independently of primary sequence conservation. While the function of FTX is not conserved in humans, JPX stands as a major regulator of XIST expression in both species. However, we show that different entities of JPX control the production of XIST at various steps depending on the species. Altogether, our study highlights the functional versatility of LRGs across evolution, and reveals that functional conservation of orthologous LRGs may involve diversified mechanisms of action. These findings represent a striking example of how the evolvability of LRGs can provide adaptative flexibility to constrained gene regulatory networks.
30742040	2019	Nature methods	Fast interpolation-based t-SNE for improved visualization of single-cell RNA-seq data.	t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) is widely used for visualizing single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, but it scales poorly to large datasets. We dramatically accelerate t-SNE, obviating the need for data downsampling, and hence allowing visualization of rare cell populations. Furthermore, we implement a heatmap-style visualization for scRNA-seq based on one-dimensional t-SNE for simultaneously visualizing the expression patterns of thousands of genes. Software is available at https://github.com/KlugerLab/FIt-SNE and https://github.com/KlugerLab/t-SNE-Heatmaps .
37872410	2024	Nature biotechnology	Scalable genetic screening for regulatory circuits using compressed Perturb-seq.	Pooled CRISPR screens with single-cell RNA sequencing readout (Perturb-seq) have emerged as a key technique in functional genomics, but they are limited in scale by cost and combinatorial complexity. In this study, we modified the design of Perturb-seq by incorporating algorithms applied to random, low-dimensional observations. Compressed Perturb-seq measures multiple random perturbations per cell or multiple cells per droplet and computationally decompresses these measurements by leveraging the sparse structure of regulatory circuits. Applied to 598 genes in the immune response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide, compressed Perturb-seq achieves the same accuracy as conventional Perturb-seq with an order of magnitude cost reduction and greater power to learn genetic interactions. We identified known and novel regulators of immune responses and uncovered evolutionarily constrained genes with downstream targets enriched for immune disease heritability, including many missed by existing genome-wide association studies. Our framework enables new scales of interrogation for a foundational method in functional genomics.
40057378	2025	Nucleic acids research	stAI: a deep learning-based model for missing gene imputation and cell-type annotation of spatial transcriptomics.	Spatial transcriptomics technology has revolutionized our understanding of cellular systems by capturing RNA transcript levels in their original spatial context. Single-cell spatial transcriptomics (scST) offers single-cell resolution expression level and precise spatial information of RNA transcripts, while it has a limited capacity for simultaneously detecting a wide range of RNA transcripts, hindering its broader applications. Characterizing the whole transcriptome level and comprehensively annotating cell types represent two significant challenges in scST applications. Despite several proposed methods for one or both tasks, their performance remains inadequate. In this work, we introduce stAI, a deep learning-based model designed to address both missing gene imputation and cell-type annotation for scST data. stAI leverages a joint embedding for the scST and the reference scRNA-seq data with two separate encoder-decoder modules. Both the imputation and annotation are performed within the latent space in a supervised manner, utilizing scRNA-seq data to guide the processes. Experiments for datasets generated from diverse platforms with varying numbers of measured genes were conducted and compared with the updated methods. The results demonstrate that stAI can predict the unmeasured genes, especially the marker genes, with much higher accuracy, and annotate the cell types, including those of small size, with high precision.
33179750	2020	Nucleic acids research	Comprehensive mapping of the human cytokine gene regulatory network.	Proper cytokine gene expression is essential in development, homeostasis and immune responses. Studies on the transcriptional control of cytokine genes have mostly focused on highly researched transcription factors (TFs) and cytokines, resulting in an incomplete portrait of cytokine gene regulation. Here, we used enhanced yeast one-hybrid (eY1H) assays to derive a comprehensive network comprising 1380 interactions between 265 TFs and 108 cytokine gene promoters. Our eY1H-derived network greatly expands the known repertoire of TF-cytokine gene interactions and the set of TFs known to regulate cytokine genes. We found an enrichment of nuclear receptors and confirmed their role in cytokine regulation in primary macrophages. Additionally, we used the eY1H-derived network as a framework to identify pairs of TFs that can be targeted with commercially-available drugs to synergistically modulate cytokine production. Finally, we integrated the eY1H data with single cell RNA-seq and phenotypic datasets to identify novel TF-cytokine regulatory axes in immune diseases and immune cell lineage development. Overall, the eY1H data provides a rich resource to study cytokine regulation in a variety of physiological and disease contexts.
40618350	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Inference of gene coexpression networks from single-cell transcriptome data based on variance decomposition analysis.	Gene regulation varies across different cell types and developmental stages, leading to distinct cellular roles across cellular populations. Investigating cell type-specific gene coexpression is therefore crucial for understanding gene functions and disease pathology. However, reconstructing gene coexpression networks from single-cell transcriptome data is challenging due to artifacts, noise, and data sparsity. Here, we present an efficient method for inference of gene coexpression networks via variance decomposition analysis (GCNVDA) to explore the underlying gene regulatory mechanisms from single-cell transcriptome data. Our model incorporates multiple sources of variability, including a random effect term $G$ to capture gene-level variance and a random effect term $E$ to account for residual errors. We applied GCNVDA to three real-world single-cell datasets, demonstrating that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms in both sensitivity and specificity for identifying tissue- or state-specific gene regulations. Furthermore, GCNVDA facilitates the discovery of functional modules that play critical roles in key biological processes such as embryonic development. These findings provide new insights into cell-specific regulatory mechanisms and have the potential to significantly advance research in developmental biology and disease pathology.
29036318	2018	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	DIMM-SC: a Dirichlet mixture model for clustering droplet-based single cell transcriptomic data.	MOTIVATION: Single cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-Seq) has become a revolutionary tool to study cellular and molecular processes at single cell resolution. Among existing technologies, the recently developed droplet-based platform enables efficient parallel processing of thousands of single cells with direct counting of transcript copies using Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI). Despite the technology advances, statistical methods and computational tools are still lacking for analyzing droplet-based scRNA-Seq data. Particularly, model-based approaches for clustering large-scale single cell transcriptomic data are still under-explored. RESULTS: We developed DIMM-SC, a Dirichlet Mixture Model for clustering droplet-based Single Cell transcriptomic data. This approach explicitly models UMI count data from scRNA-Seq experiments and characterizes variations across different cell clusters via a Dirichlet mixture prior. We performed comprehensive simulations to evaluate DIMM-SC and compared it with existing clustering methods such as K-means, CellTree and Seurat. In addition, we analyzed public scRNA-Seq datasets with known cluster labels and in-house scRNA-Seq datasets from a study of systemic sclerosis with prior biological knowledge to benchmark and validate DIMM-SC. Both simulation studies and real data applications demonstrated that overall, DIMM-SC achieves substantially improved clustering accuracy and much lower clustering variability compared to other existing clustering methods. More importantly, as a model-based approach, DIMM-SC is able to quantify the clustering uncertainty for each single cell, facilitating rigorous statistical inference and biological interpretations, which are typically unavailable from existing clustering methods. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: DIMM-SC has been implemented in a user-friendly R package with a detailed tutorial available on www.pitt.edu/ approximately wec47/singlecell.html. CONTACT: wei.chen@chp.edu or hum@ccf.org. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
38379414	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Flexiplex: a versatile demultiplexer and search tool for omics data.	MOTIVATION: The process of analyzing high throughput sequencing data often requires the identification and extraction of specific target sequences. This could include tasks, such as identifying cellular barcodes and UMIs in single-cell data, and specific genetic variants for genotyping. However, existing tools, which perform these functions are often task-specific, such as only demultiplexing barcodes for a dedicated type of experiment, or are not tolerant to noise in the sequencing data. RESULTS: To overcome these limitations, we developed Flexiplex, a versatile and fast sequence searching and demultiplexing tool for omics data, which is based on the Levenshtein distance and thus allows imperfect matches. We demonstrate Flexiplex's application on three use cases, identifying cell-line-specific sequences in Illumina short-read single-cell data, and discovering and demultiplexing cellular barcodes from noisy long-read single-cell RNA-seq data. We show that Flexiplex achieves an excellent balance of accuracy and computational efficiency compared to leading task-specific tools. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Flexiplex is available at https://davidsongroup.github.io/flexiplex/.
28981748	2017	Nucleic acids research	Linnorm: improved statistical analysis for single cell RNA-seq expression data.	Linnorm is a novel normalization and transformation method for the analysis of single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Linnorm is developed to remove technical noises and simultaneously preserve biological variations in scRNA-seq data, such that existing statistical methods can be improved. Using real scRNA-seq data, we compared Linnorm with existing normalization methods, including NODES, SAMstrt, SCnorm, scran, DESeq and TMM. Linnorm shows advantages in speed, technical noise removal and preservation of cell heterogeneity, which can improve existing methods in the discovery of novel subtypes, pseudo-temporal ordering of cells, clustering analysis, etc. Linnorm also performs better than existing DEG analysis methods, including BASiCS, NODES, SAMstrt, Seurat and DESeq2, in false positive rate control and accuracy.
26301841	2015	Nature methods	Oscope identifies oscillatory genes in unsynchronized single-cell RNA-seq experiments.	Oscillatory gene expression is fundamental to development, but technologies for monitoring expression oscillations are limited. We have developed a statistical approach called Oscope to identify and characterize the transcriptional dynamics of oscillating genes in single-cell RNA-seq data from an unsynchronized cell population. Applying Oscope to a number of data sets, we demonstrated its utility and also identified a potential artifact in the Fluidigm C1 platform.
35577954	2022	Nature methods	Benchmarking spatial and single-cell transcriptomics integration methods for transcript distribution prediction and cell type deconvolution.	Spatial transcriptomics approaches have substantially advanced our capacity to detect the spatial distribution of RNA transcripts in tissues, yet it remains challenging to characterize whole-transcriptome-level data for single cells in space. Addressing this need, researchers have developed integration methods to combine spatial transcriptomic data with single-cell RNA-seq data to predict the spatial distribution of undetected transcripts and/or perform cell type deconvolution of spots in histological sections. However, to date, no independent studies have comparatively analyzed these integration methods to benchmark their performance. Here we present benchmarking of 16 integration methods using 45 paired datasets (comprising both spatial transcriptomics and scRNA-seq data) and 32 simulated datasets. We found that Tangram, gimVI, and SpaGE outperformed other integration methods for predicting the spatial distribution of RNA transcripts, whereas Cell2location, SpatialDWLS, and RCTD are the top-performing methods for the cell type deconvolution of spots. We provide a benchmark pipeline to help researchers select optimal integration methods to process their datasets.
39508445	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Graph domain adaptation-based framework for gene expression enhancement and cell type identification in large-scale spatially resolved transcriptomics.	Spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) technologies facilitate gene expression profiling with spatial resolution in a naive state. Nevertheless, current SRT technologies exhibit limitations, manifesting as either low transcript detection sensitivity or restricted gene throughput. These constraints result in diminished precision and coverage in gene measurement. In response, we introduce SpaGDA, a sophisticated deep learning-based graph domain adaptation framework for both scenarios of gene expression imputation and cell type identification in spatially resolved transcriptomics data by impartially transferring knowledge from reference scRNA-seq data. Systematic benchmarking analyses across several SRT datasets generated from different technologies have demonstrated SpaGDA's superior effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art methods in both scenarios. Further applied to three SRT datasets of different biological contexts, SpaGDA not only better recovers the well-established knowledge sourced from public atlases and existing scientific literature but also yields a more informative spatial expression pattern of genes. Together, these results demonstrate that SpaGDA can be used to overcome the challenges of current SRT data and provide more accurate insights into biological processes or disease development. The SpaGDA is available in https://github.com/shenrb/SpaGDA.
35277705	2022	Nature methods	A pan-tissue DNA methylation atlas enables in silico decomposition of human tissue methylomes at cell-type resolution.	Bulk-tissue DNA methylomes represent an average over many different cell types, hampering our understanding of cell-type-specific contributions to disease development. As single-cell methylomics is not scalable to large cohorts of individuals, cost-effective computational solutions are needed, yet current methods are limited to tissues such as blood. Here we leverage the high-resolution nature of tissue-specific single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets to construct a DNA methylation atlas defined for 13 solid tissue types and 40 cell types. We comprehensively validate this atlas in independent bulk and single-nucleus DNA methylation datasets. We demonstrate that it correctly predicts the cell of origin of diverse cancer types and discovers new prognostic associations in olfactory neuroblastoma and stage 2 melanoma. In brain, the atlas predicts a neuronal origin for schizophrenia, with neuron-specific differential DNA methylation enriched for corresponding genome-wide association study risk loci. In summary, the DNA methylation atlas enables the decomposition of 13 different human tissue types at a high cellular resolution, paving the way for an improved interpretation of epigenetic data.
41065243	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	scHDeepInsight: a hierarchical deep learning framework for precise immune cell annotation in single-cell RNA-seq data.	Accurate classification of immune cells is crucial for elucidating their diverse roles in health and disease. However, this task remains very challenging in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data due to the complex and hierarchical relationships of immune cell types. To address this, we introduce scHDeepInsight, a deep learning framework that extends our previous scDeepInsight model by integrating a biologically-informed classification architecture with an adaptive hierarchical focal loss (AHFL). The framework builds on our established method of converting gene expression data into two-dimensional structured images, enabling convolutional neural networks to effectively capture both global and fine-grained transcriptomic features. This design utilizes hierarchical relationships among immune cell types to enhance the classification ability beyond the flat classification approaches. scHDeepInsight dynamically adjusts loss contributions to balance performance across the hierarchy levels. Comprehensive benchmarking across seven diverse tissue datasets shows scHDeepInsight achieves an average accuracy of 93.2%, surpassing contemporary methods by 5.1 percentage points. The model successfully distinguishes 50 distinct immune cell subtypes with high accuracy, demonstrating proficiency for identifying rare and closely related cell subtypes. Additionally, SHAP-based interpretability quantifies individual gene contributions to reveal the biological basis of classification decisions. These qualities make scHDeepInsight a robust tool for high-resolution cell subtype characterization, well-suited for detailed profiling in immunological studies and extensible to nonimmune cell types.
37897702	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Robust discovery of gene regulatory networks from single-cell gene expression data by Causal Inference Using Composition of Transactions.	Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) drive organism structure and functions, so the discovery and characterization of GRNs is a major goal in biological research. However, accurate identification of causal regulatory connections and inference of GRNs using gene expression datasets, more recently from single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), has been challenging. Here we employ the innovative method of Causal Inference Using Composition of Transactions (CICT) to uncover GRNs from scRNA-seq data. The basis of CICT is that if all gene expressions were random, a non-random regulatory gene should induce its targets at levels different from the background random process, resulting in distinct patterns in the whole relevance network of gene-gene associations. CICT proposes novel network features derived from a relevance network, which enable any machine learning algorithm to predict causal regulatory edges and infer GRNs. We evaluated CICT using simulated and experimental scRNA-seq data in a well-established benchmarking pipeline and showed that CICT outperformed existing network inference methods representing diverse approaches with many-fold higher accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrated that GRN inference with CICT was robust to different levels of sparsity in scRNA-seq data, the characteristics of data and ground truth, the choice of association measure and the complexity of the supervised machine learning algorithm. Our results suggest aiming at directly predicting causality to recover regulatory relationships in complex biological networks substantially improves accuracy in GRN inference.
36469543	2022	PLoS computational biology	Secuer: Ultrafast, scalable and accurate clustering of single-cell RNA-seq data.	Identifying cell clusters is a critical step for single-cell transcriptomics study. Despite the numerous clustering tools developed recently, the rapid growth of scRNA-seq volumes prompts for a more (computationally) efficient clustering method. Here, we introduce Secuer, a Scalable and Efficient speCtral clUstERing algorithm for scRNA-seq data. By employing an anchor-based bipartite graph representation algorithm, Secuer enjoys reduced runtime and memory usage over one order of magnitude for datasets with more than 1 million cells. Meanwhile, Secuer also achieves better or comparable accuracy than competing methods in small and moderate benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we showcase that Secuer can also serve as a building block for a new consensus clustering method, Secuer-consensus, which again improves the runtime and scalability of state-of-the-art consensus clustering methods while also maintaining the accuracy. Overall, Secuer is a versatile, accurate, and scalable clustering framework suitable for small to ultra-large single-cell clustering tasks.
36318258	2023	Nucleic acids research	HUSCH: an integrated single-cell transcriptome atlas for human tissue gene expression visualization and analyses.	Understanding gene expression patterns across different human cell types is crucial for investigating mechanisms of cell type differentiation, disease occurrence and progression. The recent development of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) technologies significantly boosted the characterization of cell type heterogeneities in different human tissues. However, the huge number of datasets in the public domain also posed challenges in data integration and reuse. We present Human Universal Single Cell Hub (HUSCH, http://husch.comp-genomics.org), an atlas-scale curated database that integrates single-cell transcriptomic profiles of nearly 3 million cells from 185 high-quality human scRNA-seq datasets from 45 different tissues. All the data in HUSCH were uniformly processed and annotated with a standard workflow. In the single dataset module, HUSCH provides interactive gene expression visualization, differentially expressed genes, functional analyses, transcription regulators and cell-cell interaction analyses for each cell type cluster. Besides, HUSCH integrated different datasets in the single tissue module and performs data integration, batch correction, and cell type harmonization. This allows a comprehensive visualization and analysis of gene expression within each tissue based on single-cell datasets from multiple sources and platforms. HUSCH is a flexible and comprehensive data portal that enables searching, visualizing, analyzing, and downloading single-cell gene expression for the human tissue atlas.
38436563	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	scDOT: enhancing single-cell RNA-Seq data annotation and uncovering novel cell types through multi-reference integration.	The proliferation of single-cell RNA-seq data has greatly enhanced our ability to comprehend the intricate nature of diverse tissues. However, accurately annotating cell types in such data, especially when handling multiple reference datasets and identifying novel cell types, remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we introduce Single Cell annotation based on Distance metric learning and Optimal Transport (scDOT), an innovative cell-type annotation method adept at integrating multiple reference datasets and uncovering previously unseen cell types. scDOT introduces two key innovations. First, by incorporating distance metric learning and optimal transport, it presents a novel optimization framework. This framework effectively learns the predictive power of each reference dataset for new query data and simultaneously establishes a probabilistic mapping between cells in the query data and reference-defined cell types. Secondly, scDOT develops an interpretable scoring system based on the acquired probabilistic mapping, enabling the precise identification of previously unseen cell types within the data. To rigorously assess scDOT's capabilities, we systematically evaluate its performance using two diverse collections of benchmark datasets encompassing various tissues, sequencing technologies and diverse cell types. Our experimental results consistently affirm the superior performance of scDOT in cell-type annotation and the identification of previously unseen cell types. These advancements provide researchers with a potent tool for precise cell-type annotation, ultimately enriching our understanding of complex biological tissues.
29897414	2018	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	CONICS integrates scRNA-seq with DNA sequencing to map gene expression to tumor sub-clones.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has enabled studies of tissue composition at unprecedented resolution. However, the application of scRNA-seq to clinical cancer samples has been limited, partly due to a lack of scRNA-seq algorithms that integrate genomic mutation data.

38261342	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	From G1 to M: a comparative study of methods for identifying cell cycle phases.	Accurate identification of cell cycle phases in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data is crucial for biomedical research. Many methods have been developed to tackle this challenge, employing diverse approaches to predict cell cycle phases. In this review article, we delve into the standard processes in identifying cell cycle phases within scRNA-seq data and present several representative methods for comparison. To rigorously assess the accuracy of these methods, we propose an error function and employ multiple benchmarking datasets encompassing human and mouse data. Our evaluation results reveal a key finding: the fit between the reference data and the dataset being analyzed profoundly impacts the effectiveness of cell cycle phase identification methods. Therefore, researchers must carefully consider the compatibility between the reference data and their dataset to achieve optimal results. Furthermore, we explore the potential benefits of incorporating benchmarking data with multiple known cell cycle phases into the analysis. Merging such data with the target dataset shows promise in enhancing prediction accuracy. By shedding light on the accuracy and performance of cell cycle phase prediction methods across diverse datasets, this review aims to motivate and guide future methodological advancements. Our findings offer valuable insights for researchers seeking to improve their understanding of cellular dynamics through scRNA-seq analysis, ultimately fostering the development of more robust and widely applicable cell cycle identification methods.
33939691	2021	PLoS computational biology	Pseudocell Tracer-A method for inferring dynamic trajectories using scRNAseq and its application to B cells undergoing immunoglobulin class switch recombination.	Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) can be used to infer a temporal ordering of cellular states. Current methods for the inference of cellular trajectories rely on unbiased dimensionality reduction techniques. However, such biologically agnostic ordering can prove difficult for modeling complex developmental or differentiation processes. The cellular heterogeneity of dynamic biological compartments can result in sparse sampling of key intermediate cell states. To overcome these limitations, we develop a supervised machine learning framework, called Pseudocell Tracer, which infers trajectories in pseudospace rather than in pseudotime. The method uses a supervised encoder, trained with adjacent biological information, to project scRNAseq data into a low-dimensional manifold that maps the transcriptional states a cell can occupy. Then a generative adversarial network (GAN) is used to simulate pesudocells at regular intervals along a virtual cell-state axis. We demonstrate the utility of Pseudocell Tracer by modeling B cells undergoing immunoglobulin class switch recombination (CSR) during a prototypic antigen-induced antibody response. Our results revealed an ordering of key transcription factors regulating CSR to the IgG1 isotype, including the concomitant expression of Nfkb1 and Stat6 prior to the upregulation of Bach2 expression. Furthermore, the expression dynamics of genes encoding cytokine receptors suggest a poised IL-4 signaling state that preceeds CSR to the IgG1 isotype.
36156112	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	Decoding brain memory formation by single-cell RNA sequencing.	To understand how distinct memories are formed and stored in the brain is an important and fundamental question in neuroscience and computational biology. A population of neurons, termed engram cells, represents the physiological manifestation of a specific memory trace and is characterized by dynamic changes in gene expression, which in turn alters the synaptic connectivity and excitability of these cells. Recent applications of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) are promising approaches for delineating the dynamic expression profiles in these subsets of neurons, and thus understanding memory-specific genes, their combinatorial patterns and regulatory networks. The aim of this article is to review and discuss the experimental and computational procedures of sc/snRNA-seq, new studies of molecular mechanisms of memory aided by sc/snRNA-seq in human brain diseases and related mouse models, and computational challenges in understanding the regulatory mechanisms underlying long-term memory formation.
41160885	2025	Nucleic acids research	scCT-DB, an omnibus for cancer patient-derived paired pre- and post-treatment single-cell transcriptomes to reveal drug perturbation and drug resistance mechanisms.	Drug resistance continues to be a major challenge in cancer treatment. Understanding cellular and molecular dynamics after treatment is crucial for elucidating resistance mechanisms. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of paired pre- and post-treatment patient samples enables high-resolution exploration of such dynamics, but rapidly accumulated relevant data bring challenges for easy data access, integration, and reuse. Therefore, we present the Cancer Treatment-related Single-Cell transcriptome DataBase (scCT-DB, http://scctdb.ncpsb.org.cn). scCT-DB has comprehensively collected 266 patient-derived paired pre- and post-treatment scRNA-seq datasets processed by a uniform pipeline and with detailed and structured metadata, most of which simultaneously include information on primary/acquired drug response. scCT-DB includes 6.19 million cells from 1142 original patient samples, 27 major cancer types, 96 therapeutic regimens, and 102 drugs (involving chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormone therapy, and targeted therapy). scCT-DB also provides 48 dataset pairs with opposite primary response groupings and 41 longitudinal datasets with >/=3 sampling timepoints. Besides data browsing, download, and search, scCT-DB also supports single-dataset analysis (including cell abundance, gene, cell state, and intercellular communication perturbation analyses), dataset comparative and re-combination analyses, providing insights into drug perturbation mechanisms and their heterogeneity in patients, drug resistance mechanisms, and discovery of biomarkers predictive of treatment response, etc.
30202935	2019	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	SAFE-clustering: Single-cell Aggregated (from Ensemble) clustering for single-cell RNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: Accurately clustering cell types from a mass of heterogeneous cells is a crucial first step for the analysis of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-Seq) data. Although several methods have been recently developed, they utilize different characteristics of data and yield varying results in terms of both the number of clusters and actual cluster assignments. RESULTS: Here, we present SAFE-clustering, single-cell aggregated (From Ensemble) clustering, a flexible, accurate and robust method for clustering scRNA-Seq data. SAFE-clustering takes as input, results from multiple clustering methods, to build one consensus solution. SAFE-clustering currently embeds four state-of-the-art methods, SC3, CIDR, Seurat and t-SNE + k-means; and ensembles solutions from these four methods using three hypergraph-based partitioning algorithms. Extensive assessment across 12 datasets with the number of clusters ranging from 3 to 14, and the number of single cells ranging from 49 to 32, 695 showcases the advantages of SAFE-clustering in terms of both cluster number (18.2-58.1% reduction in absolute deviation to the truth) and cluster assignment (on average 36.0% improvement, and up to 18.5% over the best of the four methods, measured by adjusted rand index). Moreover, SAFE-clustering is computationally efficient to accommodate large datasets, taking <10 min to process 28 733 cells. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: SAFEclustering, including source codes and tutorial, is freely available at https://github.com/yycunc/SAFEclustering. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
37626404	2023	Genome biology	Single-cell resolution analysis reveals the preparation for reprogramming the fate of stem cell niche in cotton lateral meristem.	BACKGROUND: Somatic embryogenesis is a major process for plant regeneration. However, cell communication and the gene regulatory network responsible for cell reprogramming during somatic embryogenesis are still largely unclear. Recent advances in single-cell technologies enable us to explore the mechanism of plant regeneration at single-cell resolution. RESULTS: We generate a high-resolution single-cell transcriptomic landscape of hypocotyl tissue from the highly regenerable cotton genotype Jin668 and the recalcitrant TM-1. We identify nine putative cell clusters and 23 cluster-specific marker genes for both cultivars. We find that the primary vascular cell is the major cell type that undergoes cell fate transition in response to external stimulation. Further developmental trajectory and gene regulatory network analysis of these cell clusters reveals that a total of 41 hormone response-related genes, including LAX2, LAX1, and LOX3, exhibit different expression patterns in the primary xylem and cambium region of Jin668 and TM-1. We also identify novel genes, including CSEF, PIS1, AFB2, ATHB2, PLC2, and PLT3, that are involved in regeneration. We demonstrate that LAX2, LAX1 and LOX3 play important roles in callus proliferation and plant regeneration by CRISPR/Cas9 editing and overexpression assay. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides novel insights on the role of the regulatory network in cell fate transition and reprogramming during plant regeneration driven by somatic embryogenesis.
30821321	2019	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Destin: toolkit for single-cell analysis of chromatin accessibility.	SUMMARY: Single-cell assay of transposase-accessible chromatin followed by sequencing (scATAC-seq) is an emerging new technology for the study of gene regulation with single-cell resolution. The data from scATAC-seq are unique-sparse, binary and highly variable even within the same cell type. As such, neither methods developed for bulk ATAC-seq nor single-cell RNA-seq data are appropriate. Here, we present Destin, a bioinformatic and statistical framework for comprehensive scATAC-seq data analysis. Destin performs cell-type clustering via weighted principle component analysis, weighting accessible chromatin regions by existing genomic annotations and publicly available regulomic datasets. The weights and additional tuning parameters are determined via model-based likelihood. We evaluated the performance of Destin using downsampled bulk ATAC-seq data of purified samples and scATAC-seq data from seven diverse experiments. Compared to existing methods, Destin was shown to outperform across all datasets and platforms. For demonstration, we further applied Destin to 2088 adult mouse forebrain cells and identified cell-type-specific association of previously reported schizophrenia GWAS loci. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Destin toolkit is freely available as an R package at https://github.com/urrutiag/destin. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
27079200	2016	Genome biology	Single-cell profiling of lncRNAs in the developing human brain.	Single-cell RNA-seq in samples from the human neocortex demonstrate that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are abundantly expressed in specific individual brain cells, despite being hard to detect in bulk samples. This result suggests that the lncRNAs might have important functions in specific cell types in the brain.
37932398	2024	Nature methods	sciCSR infers B cell state transition and predicts class-switch recombination dynamics using single-cell transcriptomic data.	Class-switch recombination (CSR) is an integral part of B cell maturation. Here we present sciCSR (pronounced 'scissor', single-cell inference of class-switch recombination), a computational pipeline that analyzes CSR events and dynamics of B cells from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiments. Validated on both simulated and real data, sciCSR re-analyzes scRNA-seq alignments to differentiate productive heavy-chain immunoglobulin transcripts from germline 'sterile' transcripts. From a snapshot of B cell scRNA-seq data, a Markov state model is built to infer the dynamics and direction of CSR. Applying sciCSR on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccination time-course scRNA-seq data, we observe that sciCSR predicts, using data from an earlier time point in the collected time-course, the isotype distribution of B cell receptor repertoires of subsequent time points with high accuracy (cosine similarity ~0.9). Using processes specific to B cells, sciCSR identifies transitions that are often missed by conventional RNA velocity analyses and can reveal insights into the dynamics of B cell CSR during immune response.
35961023	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Graph attention network for link prediction of gene regulations from single-cell RNA-sequencing data.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data provides unprecedented opportunities to reconstruct gene regulatory networks (GRNs) at fine-grained resolution. Numerous unsupervised or self-supervised models have been proposed to infer GRN from bulk RNA-seq data, but few of them are appropriate for scRNA-seq data under the circumstance of low signal-to-noise ratio and dropout. Fortunately, the surging of TF-DNA binding data (e.g. ChIP-seq) makes supervised GRN inference possible. We regard supervised GRN inference as a graph-based link prediction problem that expects to learn gene low-dimensional vectorized representations to predict potential regulatory interactions. RESULTS: In this paper, we present GENELink to infer latent interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and target genes in GRN using graph attention network. GENELink projects the single-cell gene expression with observed TF-gene pairs to a low-dimensional space. Then, the specific gene representations are learned to serve for downstream similarity measurement or causal inference of pairwise genes by optimizing the embedding space. Compared to eight existing GRN reconstruction methods, GENELink achieves comparable or better performance on seven scRNA-seq datasets with four types of ground-truth networks. We further apply GENELink on scRNA-seq of human breast cancer metastasis and reveal regulatory heterogeneity of Notch and Wnt signalling pathways between primary tumour and lung metastasis. Moreover, the ontology enrichment results of unique lung metastasis GRN indicate that mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is functionally important during the seeding step of the cancer metastatic cascade, which is validated by pharmacological assays. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The code and data are available at https://github.com/zpliulab/GENELink. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

40586320	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	An order-preserving batch-effect correction method based on a monotonic deep learning framework.	Single-cell RNA sequencing has significantly advanced our understanding of cell heterogeneity and gene regulation. Batch-effect correction is essential for achieving robust data integration. Multiple methods have been developed to address this issue, particularly procedural approaches involving components such as anchoring or deep learning, which have achieved notable successes. However, order preservation, as an important feature, has been largely overlooked in procedural methods. Based on a monotonic deep learning network, we developed a correction method with order-preserving feature. By comparing with existing methods, we demonstrated that our method effectively improved clustering performance, better retained original inter-gene correlation and differential expression information.
34252956	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Bayesian information sharing enhances detection of regulatory associations in rare cell types.	MOTIVATION: Recent advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies promise to enable the study of gene regulatory associations at unprecedented resolution in diverse cellular contexts. However, identifying unique regulatory associations observed only in specific cell types or conditions remains a key challenge; this is particularly so for rare transcriptional states whose sample sizes are too small for existing gene regulatory network inference methods to be effective. RESULTS: We present ShareNet, a Bayesian framework for boosting the accuracy of cell type-specific gene regulatory networks by propagating information across related cell types via an information sharing structure that is adaptively optimized for a given single-cell dataset. The techniques we introduce can be used with a range of general network inference algorithms to enhance the output for each cell type. We demonstrate the enhanced accuracy of our approach on three benchmark scRNA-seq datasets. We find that our inferred cell type-specific networks also uncover key changes in gene associations that underpin the complex rewiring of regulatory networks across cell types, tissues and dynamic biological processes. Our work presents a path toward extracting deeper insights about cell type-specific gene regulation in the rapidly growing compendium of scRNA-seq datasets. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The code for ShareNet is available at http://sharenet.csail.mit.edu and https://github.com/alexw16/sharenet.

36373614	2023	Nucleic acids research	NPInter v5.0: ncRNA interaction database in a new era.	Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) play key regulatory roles in biological processes by interacting with other biomolecules. With the development of high-throughput sequencing and experimental technologies, extensive ncRNA interactions have been accumulated. Therefore, we updated the NPInter database to a fifth version to document these interactions. ncRNA interaction entries were doubled from 1 100 618 to 2 596 695 by manual literature mining and high-throughput data processing. We integrated global RNA-DNA interactions from iMARGI, ChAR-seq and GRID-seq, greatly expanding the number of RNA-DNA interactions (from 888 915 to 8 329 382). In addition, we collected different types of RNA interaction between SARS-CoV-2 virus and its host from recently published studies. Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) expression specificity in different cell types from tumor single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data were also integrated to provide a cell-type level view of interactions. A new module named RBP was built to display the interactions of RNA-binding proteins with annotations of localization, binding domains and functions. In conclusion, NPInter v5.0 (http://bigdata.ibp.ac.cn/npinter5/) provides informative and valuable ncRNA interactions for biological researchers.
39482463	2024	Nature methods	Statistical inference with a manifold-constrained RNA velocity model uncovers cell cycle speed modulations.	Across biological systems, cells undergo coordinated changes in gene expression, resulting in transcriptome dynamics that unfold within a low-dimensional manifold. While low-dimensional dynamics can be extracted using RNA velocity, these algorithms can be fragile and rely on heuristics lacking statistical control. Moreover, the estimated vector field is not dynamically consistent with the traversed gene expression manifold. To address these challenges, we introduce a Bayesian model of RNA velocity that couples velocity field and manifold estimation in a reformulated, unified framework, identifying the parameters of an explicit dynamical system. Focusing on the cell cycle, we implement VeloCycle to study gene regulation dynamics on one-dimensional periodic manifolds and validate its ability to infer cell cycle periods using live imaging. We also apply VeloCycle to reveal speed differences in regionally defined progenitors and Perturb-seq gene knockdowns. Overall, VeloCycle expands the single-cell RNA sequencing analysis toolkit with a modular and statistically consistent RNA velocity inference framework.
32571363	2020	Genome biology	Approaches for integrating heterogeneous RNA-seq data reveal cross-talk between microbes and genes in asthmatic patients.	Sputum induction is a non-invasive method to evaluate the airway environment, particularly for asthma. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of sputum samples can be challenging to interpret due to the complex and heterogeneous mixtures of human cells and exogenous (microbial) material. In this study, we develop a pipeline that integrates dimensionality reduction and statistical modeling to grapple with the heterogeneity. LDA(Latent Dirichlet allocation)-link connects microbes to genes using reduced-dimensionality LDA topics. We validate our method with single-cell RNA-seq and microscopy and then apply it to the sputum of asthmatic patients to find known and novel relationships between microbes and genes.
35901449	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	GLOBE: a contrastive learning-based framework for integrating single-cell transcriptome datasets.	Integration of single-cell transcriptome datasets from multiple sources plays an important role in investigating complex biological systems. The key to integration of transcriptome datasets is batch effect removal. Recent methods attempt to apply a contrastive learning strategy to correct batch effects. Despite their encouraging performance, the optimal contrastive learning framework for batch effect removal is still under exploration. We develop an improved contrastive learning-based batch correction framework, GLOBE. GLOBE defines adaptive translation transformations for each cell to guarantee the stability of approximating batch effects. To enhance the consistency of representations alignment, GLOBE utilizes a loss function that is both hardness-aware and consistency-aware to learn batch effect-invariant representations. Moreover, GLOBE computes batch-corrected gene matrix in a transparent approach to support diverse downstream analysis. Benchmarking results on a wide spectrum of datasets show that GLOBE outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of robust batch mixing and superior conservation of biological signals. We further apply GLOBE to integrate two developing mouse neocortex datasets and show GLOBE succeeds in removing batch effects while preserving the contiguous structure of cells in raw data. Finally, a comprehensive study is conducted to validate the effectiveness of GLOBE.
30496484	2019	Nucleic acids research	Recovery and analysis of transcriptome subsets from pooled single-cell RNA-seq libraries.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) methods generate sparse gene expression profiles for thousands of single cells in a single experiment. The information in these profiles is sufficient to classify cell types by distinct expression patterns but the high complexity of scRNA-seq libraries often prevents full characterization of transcriptomes from individual cells. To extract more focused gene expression information from scRNA-seq libraries, we developed a strategy to physically recover the DNA molecules comprising transcriptome subsets, enabling deeper interrogation of the isolated molecules by another round of DNA sequencing. We applied the method in cell-centric and gene-centric modes to isolate cDNA fragments from scRNA-seq libraries. First, we resampled the transcriptomes of rare, single megakaryocytes from a complex mixture of lymphocytes and analyzed them in a second round of DNA sequencing, yielding up to 20-fold greater sequencing depth per cell and increasing the number of genes detected per cell from a median of 1313 to 2002. We similarly isolated mRNAs from targeted T cells to improve the reconstruction of their VDJ-rearranged immune receptor mRNAs. Second, we isolated CD3D mRNA fragments expressed across cells in a scRNA-seq library prepared from a clonal T cell line, increasing the number of cells with detected CD3D expression from 59.7% to 100%. Transcriptome resampling is a general approach to recover targeted gene expression information from single-cell RNA sequencing libraries that enhances the utility of these costly experiments, and may be applicable to the targeted recovery of molecules from other single-cell assays.
35764397	2022	Genome research	Unsupervised cell functional annotation for single-cell RNA-seq.	One of the first steps in the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data is the assignment of cell types. Although a number of supervised methods have been developed for this, in most cases such assignment is performed by first clustering cells in low-dimensional space and then assigning cell types to different clusters. To overcome noise and to improve cell type assignments, we developed UNIFAN, a neural network method that simultaneously clusters and annotates cells using known gene sets. UNIFAN combines both low-dimensional representation for all genes and cell-specific gene set activity scores to determine the clustering. We applied UNIFAN to human and mouse scRNA-seq data sets from several different organs. We show, by using knowledge about gene sets, that UNIFAN greatly outperforms prior methods developed for clustering scRNA-seq data. The gene sets assigned by UNIFAN to different clusters provide strong evidence for the cell type that is represented by this cluster, making annotations easier.
31216024	2019	Nucleic acids research	SMARTer single cell total RNA sequencing.	Single cell RNA sequencing methods have been increasingly used to understand cellular heterogeneity. Nevertheless, most of these methods suffer from one or more limitations, such as focusing only on polyadenylated RNA, sequencing of only the 3' end of the transcript, an exuberant fraction of reads mapping to ribosomal RNA, and the unstranded nature of the sequencing data. Here, we developed a novel single cell strand-specific total RNA library preparation method addressing all the aforementioned shortcomings. Our method was validated on a microfluidics system using three different cancer cell lines undergoing a chemical or genetic perturbation and on two other cancer cell lines sorted in microplates. We demonstrate that our total RNA-seq method detects an equal or higher number of genes compared to classic polyA[+] RNA-seq, including novel and non-polyadenylated genes. The obtained RNA expression patterns also recapitulate the expected biological signal. Inherent to total RNA-seq, our method is also able to detect circular RNAs. Taken together, SMARTer single cell total RNA sequencing is very well suited for any single cell sequencing experiment in which transcript level information is needed beyond polyadenylated genes.
31387612	2019	Genome biology	BART-Seq: cost-effective massively parallelized targeted sequencing for genomics, transcriptomics, and single-cell analysis.	We describe a highly sensitive, quantitative, and inexpensive technique for targeted sequencing of transcript cohorts or genomic regions from thousands of bulk samples or single cells in parallel. Multiplexing is based on a simple method that produces extensive matrices of diverse DNA barcodes attached to invariant primer sets, which are all pre-selected and optimized in silico. By applying the matrices in a novel workflow named Barcode Assembly foR Targeted Sequencing (BART-Seq), we analyze developmental states of thousands of single human pluripotent stem cells, either in different maintenance media or upon Wnt/beta-catenin pathway activation, which identifies the mechanisms of differentiation induction. Moreover, we apply BART-Seq to the genetic screening of breast cancer patients and identify BRCA mutations with very high precision. The processing of thousands of samples and dynamic range measurements that outperform global transcriptomics techniques makes BART-Seq first targeted sequencing technique suitable for numerous research applications.
41146337	2025	Genome biology	The role of FRUITFULL controlling cell cycle during early flower development revealed by time-series snRNA-seq experiments.	BACKGROUND: Starting from pools of undifferentiated cells, plants generate new organs postembryonically in response to external and endogenous signals. This requires a dynamic coordination of cell division with cellular growth and differentiation regulatory programs. However, little is known about how this coordination is achieved at the molecular level during flower development. RESULTS: We used time-series single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) experiments of synchronized Arabidopsis thaliana flower developmental stages to characterize the transcriptome dynamics and the connections between cell cycle and developmental regulatory programs during early flower development. The results show a bifurcation between transcriptional trajectories corresponding to cell cycle progression and floral development. We identify the regulation of the cell cycle inhibitor KIP-RELATED PROTEIN 2 (KRP2) by FRUITFULL (FUL) as a key regulatory point on this bifurcation point and validate the importance of this regulation in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Our work illustrates how time-series snRNA-seq experiments can be used to identify bifurcation points between regulatory programs and to identify candidate regulators on these bifurcations. In particular, we identify the regulation of KRP2 by FUL as an important regulatory point to balance cell division and developmental differentiation in plants.
31557285	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scDAPA: detection and visualization of dynamic alternative polyadenylation from single cell RNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: Alternative polyadenylation (APA) plays a key post-transcriptional regulatory role in mRNA stability and functions in eukaryotes. Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool to discover cellular heterogeneity at gene expression level. Given 3' enriched strategy in library construction, the most commonly used scRNA-seq protocol-10x Genomics enables us to improve the study resolution of APA to the single cell level. However, currently there is no computational tool available for investigating APA profiles from scRNA-seq data. RESULTS: Here, we present a package scDAPA for detecting and visualizing dynamic APA from scRNA-seq data. Taking bam/sam files and cell cluster labels as inputs, scDAPA detects APA dynamics using a histogram-based method and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and visualizes candidate genes with dynamic APA. Benchmarking results demonstrated that scDAPA can effectively identify genes with dynamic APA among different cell groups from scRNA-seq data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The scDAPA package is implemented in Shell and R, and is freely available at https://scdapa.sourceforge.io. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
40233119	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	A multi-view graph convolutional network framework based on adaptive adjacency matrix and multi-strategy fusion mechanism for identifying spatial domains.	MOTIVATION: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) addresses the loss of spatial context in single-cell RNA-sequencing by simultaneously capturing gene expression and spatial location information. A critical task of ST is the identification of spatial domains. However, challenges such as high noise levels and data sparsity make the identification process more difficult. RESULTS: To tackle these challenges, STMGAMF, a multi-view graph convolutional network model that employs an adaptive adjacency matrix and a multi-strategy fusion mechanism is proposed. STMGAMF dynamically adjusts the edge weights to capture complex spatial structures during training by implementing the adaptive adjacency matrix and optimizes the embedded features through the multi-strategy fusion mechanism. STMGAMF is evaluated on multiple ST datasets and outperforms existing algorithms in tasks like spatial domain identification, visualization, and spatial trajectory inference. Its robust performance in spatial domain identification and strong generalization capability position STMGAMF as a valuable tool for unraveling the complexity of tissue structures and underlying biological processes. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Source code is available at Github (https://github.com/Fuyh0628/STMGAMF) and Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/records/15103358).
35363784	2022	PLoS computational biology	Non-linear archetypal analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data by deep autoencoders.	Advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have led to successes in discovering novel cell types and understanding cellular heterogeneity among complex cell populations through cluster analysis. However, cluster analysis is not able to reveal continuous spectrum of states and underlying gene expression programs (GEPs) shared across cell types. We introduce scAAnet, an autoencoder for single-cell non-linear archetypal analysis, to identify GEPs and infer the relative activity of each GEP across cells. We use a count distribution-based loss term to account for the sparsity and overdispersion of the raw count data and add an archetypal constraint to the loss function of scAAnet. We first show that scAAnet outperforms existing methods for archetypal analysis across different metrics through simulations. We then demonstrate the ability of scAAnet to extract biologically meaningful GEPs using publicly available scRNA-seq datasets including a pancreatic islet dataset, a lung idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis dataset and a prefrontal cortex dataset.
26099264	2015	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Sincell: an R/Bioconductor package for statistical assessment of cell-state hierarchies from single-cell RNA-seq.	Cell differentiation processes are achieved through a continuum of hierarchical intermediate cell states that might be captured by single-cell RNA seq. Existing computational approaches for the assessment of cell-state hierarchies from single-cell data can be formalized under a general framework composed of (i) a metric to assess cell-to-cell similarities (with or without a dimensionality reduction step) and (ii) a graph-building algorithm (optionally making use of a cell clustering step). The Sincell R package implements a methodological toolbox allowing flexible workflows under such a framework. Furthermore, Sincell contributes new algorithms to provide cell-state hierarchies with statistical support while accounting for stochastic factors in single-cell RNA seq. Graphical representations and functional association tests are provided to interpret hierarchies. The functionalities of Sincell are illustrated in a real case study, which demonstrates its ability to discriminate noisy from stable cell-state hierarchies. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Sincell is an open-source R/Bioconductor package available at http://bioconductor.org/packages/sincell. A detailed manual and a vignette are provided with the package. CONTACT: antonio.rausell@isb-sib.ch SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
31856883	2019	Genome biology	Genotype-free demultiplexing of pooled single-cell RNA-seq.	A variety of methods have been developed to demultiplex pooled samples in a single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiment which either require hashtag barcodes or sample genotypes prior to pooling. We introduce scSplit which utilizes genetic differences inferred from scRNA-seq data alone to demultiplex pooled samples. scSplit also enables mapping clusters to original samples. Using simulated, merged, and pooled multi-individual datasets, we show that scSplit prediction is highly concordant with demuxlet predictions and is highly consistent with the known truth in cell-hashing dataset. scSplit is ideally suited to samples without external genotype information and is available at: https://github.com/jon-xu/scSplit.
36383176	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scAWMV: an adaptively weighted multi-view learning framework for the integrative analysis of parallel scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data.	MOTIVATION: Technological advances have enabled us to profile single-cell multi-omics data from the same cells, providing us with an unprecedented opportunity to understand the cellular phenotype and links to its genotype. The available protocols and multi-omics datasets [including parallel single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) data profiled from the same cell] are growing increasingly. However, such data are highly sparse and tend to have high level of noise, making data analysis challenging. The methods that integrate the multi-omics data can potentially improve the capacity of revealing the cellular heterogeneity. RESULTS: We propose an adaptively weighted multi-view learning (scAWMV) method for the integrative analysis of parallel scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data profiled from the same cell. scAWMV considers both the difference in importance across different modalities in multi-omics data and the biological connection of the features in the scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data. It generates biologically meaningful low-dimensional representations for the transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles via unsupervised learning. Application to four real datasets demonstrates that our framework scAWMV is an efficient method to dissect cellular heterogeneity for single-cell multi-omics data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The software and datasets are available at https://github.com/pengchengzeng/scAWMV.

39230705	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	A physics-informed neural SDE network for learning cellular dynamics from time-series scRNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: Learning cellular dynamics through reconstruction of the underlying cellular potential energy landscape (aka Waddington landscape) from time-series single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data is a current challenge. Prevailing data-driven computational methods can be hampered by the lack of physical principles to guide learning from complex data, resulting in reduced prediction accuracy and interpretability when applied to infer cell population dynamics. RESULTS: Here, we propose PI-SDE, a physics-informed neural stochastic differential equation (SDE) framework that combines the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equation and neural SDE to learn cellular dynamics. Grounded in potential energy theory of biological systems, PI-SDE integrates the principle of least action by enforcing the HJ equation when reconstructing cellular potential energy function. This approach not only facilitates accurate predictions, but also improves interpretability, especially in the reconstructed potential energy landscape. Through benchmarking on two real scRNA-seq datasets, we demonstrate the importance of incorporating the HJ regularization term in dynamic inference, especially in predicting gene expression at held-out time points. Meanwhile, the learned potential energy landscape provides biologically interpretable insights into the process of cell differentiation. Our framework enhances model performance, while maintaining robustness and stability. AVAILABILITY: PI-SDE software is available at https://github.com/QiJiang-QJ/PI-SDE.
36282843	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Identifying the critical state of complex biological systems by the directed-network rank score method.	MOTIVATION: Catastrophic transitions are ubiquitous in the dynamic progression of complex biological systems; that is, a critical transition at which complex systems suddenly shift from one stable state to another occurs. Identifying such a critical point or tipping point is essential for revealing the underlying mechanism of complex biological systems. However, it is difficult to identify the tipping point since few significant differences in the critical state are detected in terms of traditional static measurements. RESULTS: In this study, by exploring the dynamic changes in gene cooperative effects between the before-transition and critical states, we presented a model-free approach, the directed-network rank score (DNRS), to detect the early-warning signal of critical transition in complex biological systems. The proposed method is applicable to both bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. This computational method was validated by the successful identification of the critical or pre-transition state for both simulated and six real datasets, including three scRNA-seq datasets of embryonic development and three tumor datasets. In addition, the functional and pathway enrichment analyses suggested that the corresponding DNRS signaling biomarkers were involved in key biological processes.

34020539	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	Comparison of high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing data processing pipelines.	With the development of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology, it has become possible to perform large-scale transcript profiling for tens of thousands of cells in a single experiment. Many analysis pipelines have been developed for data generated from different high-throughput scRNA-seq platforms, bringing a new challenge to users to choose a proper workflow that is efficient, robust and reliable for a specific sequencing platform. Moreover, as the amount of public scRNA-seq data has increased rapidly, integrated analysis of scRNA-seq data from different sources has become increasingly popular. However, it remains unclear whether such integrated analysis would be biassed if the data were processed by different upstream pipelines. In this study, we encapsulated seven existing high-throughput scRNA-seq data processing pipelines with Nextflow, a general integrative workflow management framework, and evaluated their performance in terms of running time, computational resource consumption and data analysis consistency using eight public datasets generated from five different high-throughput scRNA-seq platforms. Our work provides a useful guideline for the selection of scRNA-seq data processing pipelines based on their performance on different real datasets. In addition, these guidelines can serve as a performance evaluation framework for future developments in high-throughput scRNA-seq data processing.
34747477	2022	Nucleic acids research	SPICA: Swiss portal for immune cell analysis.	Single-cell transcriptomics allows the study of immune cell heterogeneity at an unprecedented level of resolution. The Swiss portal for immune cell analysis (SPICA) is a web resource dedicated to the exploration and analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data of immune cells. In contrast to other single-cell databases, SPICA hosts curated, cell type-specific reference atlases that describe immune cell states at high resolution, and published single-cell datasets analysed in the context of these atlases. Additionally, users can privately analyse their own data in the context of existing atlases and contribute to the SPICA database. SPICA is available at https://spica.unil.ch.
33381821	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	SCHNEL: scalable clustering of high dimensional single-cell data.	MOTIVATION: Single cell data measures multiple cellular markers at the single-cell level for thousands to millions of cells. Identification of distinct cell populations is a key step for further biological understanding, usually performed by clustering this data. Dimensionality reduction based clustering tools are either not scalable to large datasets containing millions of cells, or not fully automated requiring an initial manual estimation of the number of clusters. Graph clustering tools provide automated and reliable clustering for single cell data, but suffer heavily from scalability to large datasets. RESULTS: We developed SCHNEL, a scalable, reliable and automated clustering tool for high-dimensional single-cell data. SCHNEL transforms large high-dimensional data to a hierarchy of datasets containing subsets of data points following the original data manifold. The novel approach of SCHNEL combines this hierarchical representation of the data with graph clustering, making graph clustering scalable to millions of cells. Using seven different cytometry datasets, SCHNEL outperformed three popular clustering tools for cytometry data, and was able to produce meaningful clustering results for datasets of 3.5 and 17.2 million cells within workable time frames. In addition, we show that SCHNEL is a general clustering tool by applying it to single-cell RNA sequencing data, as well as a popular machine learning benchmark dataset MNIST. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Implementation is available on GitHub (https://github.com/biovault/SCHNELpy). All datasets used in this study are publicly available. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
35419595	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	Spectral clustering of single cells using Siamese nerual network combined with improved affinity matrix.	Limitations of bulk sequencing techniques on cell heterogeneity and diversity analysis have been pushed with the development of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). To detect clusters of cells is a key step in the analysis of scRNA-seq. However, the high-dimensionality of scRNA-seq data and the imbalances in the number of different subcellular types are ubiquitous in real scRNA-seq data sets, which poses a huge challenge to the single-cell-type detection.We propose a meta-learning-based model, SiaClust, which is the combination of Siamese Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and improved spectral clustering, to achieve scRNA-seq cell type detection. To be specific, with the help of the constrained Sigmoid kernel, the raw high-dimensionality data is mapped to a low-dimensional space, and the Siamese CNN learns the differences between the cell types in the low-dimensional feature space. The similarity matrix learned by Siamese CNN is used in combination with improved spectral clustering and t-distribution Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) for visualization. SiaClust highlights the differences between cell types by comparing the similarity of the samples, whereas blurring the differences within the cell types is better in processing high-dimensional and imbalanced data. SiaClust significantly improves clustering accuracy by using data generated by nine different species and tissues through different scNA-seq protocols for extensive evaluation, as well as analogies to state-of-the-art single-cell clustering models. More importantly, SiaClust accurately locates the exact site of dropout gene, and is more flexible with data size and cell type.
40205439	2025	Genome biology	Filtering cells with high mitochondrial content depletes viable metabolically altered malignant cell populations in cancer single-cell studies.	BACKGROUND: Single-cell transcriptomics has transformed our understanding of cellular diversity, yet noise from technical artifacts and low-quality cells can obscure key biological signals. A common practice is filtering out cells with a high percentage of mitochondrial RNA counts (pctMT), typically indicative of cell death. However, commonly used filtering thresholds, primarily derived from studies on healthy tissues, may be overly stringent for malignant cells, which often naturally exhibit higher baseline mitochondrial gene expression. RESULTS: We examine nine public single-cell RNA-seq datasets from various cancers, including 441,445 cells from 134 patients, and public spatial transcriptomics data, assessing the viability of malignant cells with high pctMT. Our analysis reveals that malignant cells exhibit significantly higher pctMT than nonmalignant cells, without a notable increase in dissociation-induced stress scores. Malignant cells with high pctMT show metabolic dysregulation, including increased xenobiotic metabolism, relevant to therapeutic response. Analysis of pctMT in cancer cell lines further reveals links to drug resistance. We also observe associations between pctMT and malignant cell transcriptional heterogeneity, as well as patient clinical features. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides insights into the functional characteristics of malignant cells with elevated pctMT, challenging current quality control practices in tumor single-cell RNA-seq analyses and offering potential improvements in data interpretation for future cancer studies.
35106553	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	Vec2image: an explainable artificial intelligence model for the feature representation and classification of high-dimensional biological data by vector-to-image conversion.	Feature representation and discriminative learning are proven models and technologies in artificial intelligence fields; however, major challenges for machine learning on large biological datasets are learning an effective model with mechanistical explanation on the model determination and prediction. To satisfy such demands, we developed Vec2image, an explainable convolutional neural network framework for characterizing the feature engineering, feature selection and classifier training that is mainly based on the collaboration of principal component coordinate conversion, deep residual neural networks and embedded k-nearest neighbor representation on pseudo images of high-dimensional biological data, where the pseudo images represent feature measurements and feature associations simultaneously. Vec2image has achieved better performance compared with other popular methods and illustrated its efficiency on feature selection in cell marker identification from tissue-specific single-cell datasets. In particular, in a case study on type 2 diabetes (T2D) by multiple human islet scRNA-seq datasets, Vec2image first displayed robust performance on T2D classification model building across different datasets, then a specific Vec2image model was trained to accurately recognize the cell state and efficiently rank feature genes relevant to T2D which uncovered potential T2D cellular pathogenesis; and next the cell activity changes, cell composition imbalances and cell-cell communication dysfunctions were associated to our finding T2D feature genes from both population-shared and individual-specific perspectives. Collectively, Vec2image is a new and efficient explainable artificial intelligence methodology that can be widely applied in human-readable classification and prediction on the basis of pseudo image representation of biological deep sequencing data.
39899596	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Cell-type deconvolution for bulk RNA-seq data using single-cell reference: a comparative analysis and recommendation guideline.	The accurate estimation of cell type proportions in tissues is crucial for various downstream analyses. With the increasing availability of single-cell sequencing data, numerous deconvolution methods that use single-cell RNA sequencing data as a reference have been developed. However, a unified understanding of how these deconvolution approaches perform in practical applications is still lacking. To address this, we systematically assessed the accuracy and robustness of nine deconvolution methods that use single-cell RNA sequencing data as a reference, evaluating them on real bulk data with cell proportions verified through flow cytometry, as well as simulated bulk data generated from five single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. Our study highlights the importance of several factors-including reference dataset construction strategies, dataset size, cell type subdivision, and cell type inconsistency-on the accuracy and robustness of deconvolution results. We also propose a set of recommended guidelines for software users in diverse scenarios.
40698863	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Applications and techniques of single-cell RNA sequencing across diverse species.	Single-cell ribonucleic acid sequencing (scRNA-seq) is an important tool in molecular biology, allowing transcriptomic profiling at the single-cell level. This transformative technology has provided unprecedented insights into cellular heterogeneity, lineage differentiation, and cell-type-specific gene expression patterns, significantly advancing our understanding of complex biological systems. scRNA-seq is broadly applied across various fields, including oncology, where it sheds light on intratumoral heterogeneity and precision medicine strategies, and developmental biology, where it uncovers cellular trajectories in both model and non-model organisms. Additionally, scRNA-seq has been instrumental in ecological genomics, which can help elucidate cellular responses to environmental perturbations and species interactions. Despite these advancements, several challenges remain, particularly technical and financial barriers, limiting its application to non-model organisms and tissues with complex cellular compositions. Addressing these issues will require continued innovation in single-cell isolation methods, cost-effective sequencing technologies, and sophisticated bioinformatics tools. As scRNA-seq advances, it can deepen our understanding of biological systems, with broad implications for personalized medicine, evolutionary biology, and ecological research.
30799483	2019	Nucleic acids research	SuperCT: a supervised-learning framework for enhanced characterization of single-cell transcriptomic profiles.	Characterization of individual cell types is fundamental to the study of multicellular samples. Single-cell RNAseq techniques, which allow high-throughput expression profiling of individual cells, have significantly advanced our ability of this task. Currently, most of the scRNA-seq data analyses are commenced with unsupervised clustering. Clusters are often assigned to different cell types based on the enriched canonical markers. However, this process is inefficient and arbitrary. In this study, we present a technical framework of training the expandable supervised-classifier in order to reveal the single-cell identities as soon as the single-cell expression profile is input. Using multiple scRNA-seq datasets we demonstrate the superior accuracy, robustness, compatibility and expandability of this new solution compared to the traditional methods. We use two examples of the model upgrade to demonstrate how the projected evolution of the cell-type classifier is realized.
34035047	2021	Genome research	A joint deep learning model enables simultaneous batch effect correction, denoising, and clustering in single-cell transcriptomics.	Recent developments of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) technologies have led to enormous biological discoveries. As the scale of scRNA-seq studies increases, a major challenge in analysis is batch effects, which are inevitable in studies involving human tissues. Most existing methods remove batch effects in a low-dimensional embedding space. Although useful for clustering, batch effects are still present in the gene expression space, leaving downstream gene-level analysis susceptible to batch effects. Recent studies have shown that batch effect correction in the gene expression space is much harder than in the embedding space. Methods such as Seurat 3.0 rely on the mutual nearest neighbor (MNN) approach to remove batch effects in gene expression, but MNN can only analyze two batches at a time, and it becomes computationally infeasible when the number of batches is large. Here, we present CarDEC, a joint deep learning model that simultaneously clusters and denoises scRNA-seq data while correcting batch effects both in the embedding and the gene expression space. Comprehensive evaluations spanning different species and tissues showed that CarDEC outperforms Scanorama, DCA + Combat, scVI, and MNN. With CarDEC denoising, non-highly variable genes offer as much signal for clustering as the highly variable genes (HVGs), suggesting that CarDEC substantially boosted information content in scRNA-seq. We also showed that trajectory analysis using CarDEC's denoised and batch-corrected expression as input revealed marker genes and transcription factors that are otherwise obscured in the presence of batch effects. CarDEC is computationally fast, making it a desirable tool for large-scale scRNA-seq studies.
35914950	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	Learning discriminative and structural samples for rare cell types with deep generative model.	Cell types (subpopulations) serve as bio-markers for the diagnosis and therapy of complex diseases, and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) measures expression of genes at cell level, paving the way for the identification of cell types. Although great efforts have been devoted to this issue, it remains challenging to identify rare cell types in scRNA-seq data because of the few-shot problem, lack of interpretability and separation of generating samples and clustering of cells. To attack these issues, a novel deep generative model for leveraging the small samples of cells (aka scLDS2) is proposed by precisely estimating the distribution of different cells, which discriminate the rare and non-rare cell types with adversarial learning. Specifically, to enhance interpretability of samples, scLDS2 generates the sparse faked samples of cells with $\ell _1$-norm, where the relations among cells are learned, facilitating the identification of cell types. Furthermore, scLDS2 directly obtains cell types from the generated samples by learning the block structure such that cells belonging to the same types are similar to each other with the nuclear-norm. scLDS2 joins the generation of samples, classification of the generated and truth samples for cells and feature extraction into a unified generative framework, which transforms the rare cell types detection problem into a classification problem, paving the way for the identification of cell types with joint learning. The experimental results on 20 datasets demonstrate that scLDS2 significantly outperforms 17 state-of-the-art methods in terms of various measurements with 25.12% improvement in adjusted rand index on average, providing an effective strategy for scRNA-seq data with rare cell types. (The software is coded using python, and is freely available for academic https://github.com/xkmaxidian/scLDS2).
34571530	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	scDEA: differential expression analysis in single-cell RNA-sequencing data via ensemble learning.	The identification of differentially expressed genes between different cell groups is a crucial step in analyzing single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Even though various differential expression analysis methods for scRNA-seq data have been proposed based on different model assumptions and strategies recently, the differentially expressed genes identified by them are quite different from each other, and the performances of them depend on the underlying data structures. In this paper, we propose a new ensemble learning-based differential expression analysis method, scDEA, to produce a more stable and accurate result. scDEA integrates the P-values obtained from 12 individual differential expression analysis methods for each gene using a P-value combination method. Comprehensive experiments show that scDEA outperforms the state-of-the-art individual methods with different experimental settings and evaluation metrics. We expect that scDEA will serve a wide range of users, including biologists, bioinformaticians and data scientists, who need to detect differentially expressed genes in scRNA-seq data.
34888622	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scShaper: an ensemble method for fast and accurate linear trajectory inference from single-cell RNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: Computational models are needed to infer a representation of the cells, i.e. a trajectory, from single-cell RNA-sequencing data that model cell differentiation during a dynamic process. Although many trajectory inference methods exist, their performance varies greatly depending on the dataset and hence there is a need to establish more accurate, better generalizable methods. RESULTS: We introduce scShaper, a new trajectory inference method that enables accurate linear trajectory inference. The ensemble approach of scShaper generates a continuous smooth pseudotime based on a set of discrete pseudotimes. We demonstrate that scShaper is able to infer accurate trajectories for a variety of trigonometric trajectories, including many for which the commonly used principal curves method fails. A comprehensive benchmarking with state-of-the-art methods revealed that scShaper achieved superior accuracy of the cell ordering and, in particular, the differentially expressed genes. Moreover, scShaper is a fast method with few hyperparameters, making it a promising alternative to the principal curves method for linear pseudotemporal ordering. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: scShaper is available as an R package at https://github.com/elolab/scshaper. The test data are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5734488.

40794574	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Less is more: improving cell-type identification with augmentation-free single-cell RNA-Seq contrastive learning.	MOTIVATION: Cell-type identification is one of the most important tasks in single-cell RNA Sequencing (scRNA-Seq) analysis. Recent research has revealed contrastive learning's great potential in handling multiple cell-type identification tasks. RESULTS: In this work, we proposed a novel augmentation-free scRNA-Seq contrastive learning (AF-RCL) algorithm, which simplifies the conventional data augmentation operation and adopts a new contrastive learning loss function. A large-scale empirical evaluation suggests that AF-RCL not only outperformed other contrastive learning-based cell-type identification methods but also obtained state-of-the-art predictive performance compared with other well-known cell-type identification methods. Further analysis also shows AF-RCL's advantages in learning high-quality discriminative feature representations based on scRNA-Seq expression profiles. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code is available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.28830311.v1 and at https://github.com/ibrahimsaggaf/AFRCL.

40662778	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Fast and scalable Wasserstein-1 neural optimal transport solver for single-cell perturbation prediction.	"MOTIVATION: Predicting single-cell perturbation responses requires mapping between two unpaired single-cell data distributions. Optimal transport (OT) theory provides a principled framework for constructing such mappings by minimizing transport cost. Recently, Wasserstein-2 (W2) neural optimal transport solvers (e.g. CellOT) have been used for this prediction task. However, W2 OT relies on the general Kantorovich dual formulation, which involves optimizing over two conjugate functions, leading to a complex min-max optimization problem that converges slowly. RESULTS: To address these challenges, we propose a novel solver based on the Wasserstein-1 (W1) dual formulation. Unlike W2, the W1 dual simplifies the optimization to a maximization problem over a single 1-Lipschitz function, thus eliminating the need for time-consuming min-max optimization. While solving the W1 dual only reveals the transport direction and does not directly provide a unique optimal transport map, we incorporate an additional step using adversarial training to determine an appropriate transport step size, effectively recovering the transport map. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed W1 neural optimal transport solver can mimic the W2 OT solvers in finding a unique and ""monotonic"" map on 2D datasets. Moreover, the W1 OT solver achieves performance on par with or surpasses W2 OT solvers on real single-cell perturbation datasets. Furthermore, we show that W1 OT solver achieves 25 approximately 45x speedup, scales better on high dimensional transportation task, and can be directly applied on single-cell RNA-seq dataset with highly variable genes. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Our implementation and experiments are open-sourced at https://github.com/poseidonchan/w1ot."
33077966	2020	Nature methods	MARS: discovering novel cell types across heterogeneous single-cell experiments.	Although tremendous effort has been put into cell-type annotation, identification of previously uncharacterized cell types in heterogeneous single-cell RNA-seq data remains a challenge. Here we present MARS, a meta-learning approach for identifying and annotating known as well as new cell types. MARS overcomes the heterogeneity of cell types by transferring latent cell representations across multiple datasets. MARS uses deep learning to learn a cell embedding function as well as a set of landmarks in the cell embedding space. The method has a unique ability to discover cell types that have never been seen before and annotate experiments that are as yet unannotated. We apply MARS to a large mouse cell atlas and show its ability to accurately identify cell types, even when it has never seen them before. Further, MARS automatically generates interpretable names for new cell types by probabilistically defining a cell type in the embedding space.
35960757	2022	PLoS computational biology	De novo spatiotemporal modelling of cell-type signatures in the developmental human heart using graph convolutional neural networks.	With the emergence of high throughput single cell techniques, the understanding of the molecular and cellular diversity of mammalian organs have rapidly increased. In order to understand the spatial organization of this diversity, single cell data is often integrated with spatial data to create probabilistic cell maps. However, targeted cell typing approaches relying on existing single cell data achieve incomplete and biased maps that could mask the true diversity present in a tissue slide. Here we applied a de novo technique to spatially resolve and characterize cellular diversity of in situ sequencing data during human heart development. We obtained and made accessible well defined spatial cell-type maps of fetal hearts from 4.5 to 9 post conception weeks, not biased by probabilistic cell typing approaches. With our analysis, we could characterize previously unreported molecular diversity within cardiomyocytes and epicardial cells and identified their characteristic expression signatures, comparing them with specific subpopulations found in single cell RNA sequencing datasets. We further characterized the differentiation trajectories of epicardial cells, identifying a clear spatial component on it. All in all, our study provides a novel technique for conducting de novo spatial-temporal analyses in developmental tissue samples and a useful resource for online exploration of cell-type differentiation during heart development at sub-cellular image resolution.
27176874	2016	Genome biology	Single-cell analysis of CD4+ T-cell differentiation reveals three major cell states and progressive acceleration of proliferation.	BACKGROUND: Differentiation of lymphocytes is frequently accompanied by cell cycle changes, interplay that is of central importance for immunity but is still incompletely understood. Here, we interrogate and quantitatively model how proliferation is linked to differentiation in CD4+ T cells. RESULTS: We perform ex vivo single-cell RNA-sequencing of CD4+ T cells during a mouse model of infection that elicits a type 2 immune response and infer that the differentiated, cytokine-producing cells cycle faster than early activated precursor cells. To dissect this phenomenon quantitatively, we determine expression profiles across consecutive generations of differentiated and undifferentiated cells during Th2 polarization in vitro. We predict three discrete cell states, which we verify by single-cell quantitative PCR. Based on these three states, we extract rates of death, division and differentiation with a branching state Markov model to describe the cell population dynamics. From this multi-scale modelling, we infer a significant acceleration in proliferation from the intermediate activated cell state to the mature cytokine-secreting effector state. We confirm this acceleration both by live imaging of single Th2 cells and in an ex vivo Th1 malaria model by single-cell RNA-sequencing. CONCLUSION: The link between cytokine secretion and proliferation rate holds both in Th1 and Th2 cells in vivo and in vitro, indicating that this is likely a general phenomenon in adaptive immunity.
33901274	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	TIMEx: tumor-immune microenvironment deconvolution web-portal for bulk transcriptomics using pan-cancer scRNA-seq signatures.	SUMMARY: The heterogeneous cell types of the tumor-immune microenvironment (TIME) play key roles in determining cancer progression, metastasis and response to treatment. We report the development of TIMEx, a novel TIME deconvolution method emphasizing on estimating infiltrating immune cells for bulk transcriptomics using pan-cancer single-cell RNA-seq signatures. We also implemented a comprehensive, user-friendly web-portal for users to evaluate TIMEx and other deconvolution methods with bulk transcriptomic profiles. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: TIMEx web-portal is freely accessible at http://timex.moffitt.org. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
32366989	2020	Nature methods	Souporcell: robust clustering of single-cell RNA-seq data by genotype without reference genotypes.	Methods to deconvolve single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data are necessary for samples containing a mixture of genotypes, whether they are natural or experimentally combined. Multiplexing across donors is a popular experimental design that can avoid batch effects, reduce costs and improve doublet detection. By using variants detected in scRNA-seq reads, it is possible to assign cells to their donor of origin and identify cross-genotype doublets that may have highly similar transcriptional profiles, precluding detection by transcriptional profile. More subtle cross-genotype variant contamination can be used to estimate the amount of ambient RNA. Ambient RNA is caused by cell lysis before droplet partitioning and is an important confounder of scRNA-seq analysis. Here we develop souporcell, a method to cluster cells using the genetic variants detected within the scRNA-seq reads. We show that it achieves high accuracy on genotype clustering, doublet detection and ambient RNA estimation, as demonstrated across a range of challenging scenarios.
35073995	2022	Genome biology	IDEAS: individual level differential expression analysis for single-cell RNA-seq data.	We consider an increasingly popular study design where single-cell RNA-seq data are collected from multiple individuals and the question of interest is to find genes that are differentially expressed between two groups of individuals. Towards this end, we propose a statistical method named IDEAS (individual level differential expression analysis for scRNA-seq). For each gene, IDEAS summarizes its expression in each individual by a distribution and then assesses whether these individual-specific distributions are different between two groups of individuals. We apply IDEAS to assess gene expression differences of autism patients versus controls and COVID-19 patients with mild versus severe symptoms.
38317025	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	AGImpute: imputation of scRNA-seq data based on a hybrid GAN with dropouts identification.	MOTIVATION: Dropout events bring challenges in analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing data as they introduce noise and distort the true distributions of gene expression profiles. Recent studies focus on estimating dropout probability and imputing dropout events by leveraging information from similar cells or genes. However, the number of dropout events differs in different cells, due to the complex factors, such as different sequencing protocols, cell types, and batch effects. The dropout event differences are not fully considered in assessing the similarities between cells and genes, which compromises the reliability of downstream analysis. RESULTS: This work proposes a hybrid Generative Adversarial Network with dropouts identification to impute single-cell RNA sequencing data, named AGImpute. First, the numbers of dropout events in different cells in scRNA-seq data are differentially estimated by using a dynamic threshold estimation strategy. Next, the identified dropout events are imputed by a hybrid deep learning model, combining Autoencoder with a Generative Adversarial Network. To validate the efficiency of the AGImpute, it is compared with seven state-of-the-art dropout imputation methods on two simulated datasets and seven real single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. The results show that AGImpute imputes the least number of dropout events than other methods. Moreover, AGImpute enhances the performance of downstream analysis, including clustering performance, identifying cell-specific marker genes, and inferring trajectory in the time-course dataset. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code can be obtained from https://github.com/xszhu-lab/AGImpute.
33595622	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	IRIS-FGM: an integrative single-cell RNA-Seq interpretation system for functional gene module analysis.	SUMMARY: Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) data is useful in discovering cell heterogeneity and signature genes in specific cell populations in cancer and other complex diseases. Specifically, the investigation of condition-specific functional gene modules (FGM) can help to understand interactive gene networks and complex biological processes in different cell clusters. QUBIC2 is recognized as one of the most efficient and effective biclustering tools for condition-specific FGM identification from scRNA-Seq data. However, its limited availability to a C implementation restricted its application to only a few downstream analysis functionalities. We developed an R package named IRIS-FGM (Integrative scRNA-Seq Interpretation System for Functional Gene Module analysis) to support the investigation of FGMs and cell clustering using scRNA-Seq data. Empowered by QUBIC2, IRIS-FGM can effectively identify condition-specific FGMs, predict cell types/clusters, uncover differentially expressed genes and perform pathway enrichment analysis. It is noteworthy that IRIS-FGM can also take Seurat objects as input, facilitating easy integration with the existing analysis pipeline. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: IRIS-FGM is implemented in the R environment (as of version 3.6) with the source code freely available at https://github.com/BMEngineeR/IRISFGM. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
34655292	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	sciCNV: high-throughput paired profiling of transcriptomes and DNA copy number variations at single-cell resolution.	Chromosome copy number variations (CNVs) are a near-universal feature of cancer; however, their individual effects on cellular function are often incompletely understood. Single-cell ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing (scRNA-seq) might be leveraged to reveal the function of intra-clonal CNVs; however, it cannot directly link cellular gene expression to CNVs. Here, we report a high-throughput scRNA-seq analysis pipeline that provides paired CNV profiles and transcriptomes for single cells, enabling exploration of the effects of CNVs on cellular programs. RTAM1 and -2 normalization methods are described, and are shown to improve transcriptome alignment between cells, increasing the sensitivity of scRNA-seq for CNV detection. We also report single-cell inferred chromosomal copy number variation (sciCNV), a tool for inferring single-cell CNVs from scRNA-seq at 19-46 Mb resolution. Comparison of sciCNV with existing RNA-based CNV methods reveals useful advances in sensitivity and specificity. Using sciCNV, we demonstrate that scRNA-seq can be used to examine the cellular effects of cancer CNVs. As an example, sciCNV is used to identify subclonal multiple myeloma (MM) cells with +8q22-24. Studies of the gene expression of intra-clonal MM cells with and without the CNV demonstrate that +8q22-24 upregulates MYC and MYC-target genes, messenger RNA processing and protein synthesis, which is consistent with established models. In conclusion, we provide new tools for scRNA-seq that enable paired profiling of the CNVs and transcriptomes of single cells, facilitating rapid and accurate deconstruction of the effects of cancer CNVs on cellular programming.
27923064	2016	PLoS computational biology	Sparse Regression Based Structure Learning of Stochastic Reaction Networks from Single Cell Snapshot Time Series.	Stochastic chemical reaction networks constitute a model class to quantitatively describe dynamics and cell-to-cell variability in biological systems. The topology of these networks typically is only partially characterized due to experimental limitations. Current approaches for refining network topology are based on the explicit enumeration of alternative topologies and are therefore restricted to small problem instances with almost complete knowledge. We propose the reactionet lasso, a computational procedure that derives a stepwise sparse regression approach on the basis of the Chemical Master Equation, enabling large-scale structure learning for reaction networks by implicitly accounting for billions of topology variants. We have assessed the structure learning capabilities of the reactionet lasso on synthetic data for the complete TRAIL induced apoptosis signaling cascade comprising 70 reactions. We find that the reactionet lasso is able to efficiently recover the structure of these reaction systems, ab initio, with high sensitivity and specificity. With only < 1% false discoveries, the reactionet lasso is able to recover 45% of all true reactions ab initio among > 6000 possible reactions and over 102000 network topologies. In conjunction with information rich single cell technologies such as single cell RNA sequencing or mass cytometry, the reactionet lasso will enable large-scale structure learning, particularly in areas with partial network structure knowledge, such as cancer biology, and thereby enable the detection of pathological alterations of reaction networks. We provide software to allow for wide applicability of the reactionet lasso.
38599684	2024	Genome research	Transcriptional programs mediating neuronal toxicity and altered glial-neuronal signaling in a Drosophila knock-in tauopathy model.	Missense mutations in the gene encoding the microtubule-associated protein TAU (current and approved symbol is MAPT) cause autosomal dominant forms of frontotemporal dementia. Multiple models of frontotemporal dementia based on transgenic expression of human TAU in experimental model organisms, including Drosophila, have been described. These models replicate key features of the human disease but do not faithfully recreate the genetic context of the human disorder. Here we use CRISPR-Cas-mediated gene editing to model frontotemporal dementia caused by the TAU P301L mutation by creating the orthologous mutation, P251L, in the endogenous Drosophila tau gene. Flies heterozygous or homozygous for Tau P251L display age-dependent neurodegeneration, display metabolic defects, and accumulate DNA damage in affected neurons. To understand the molecular events promoting neuronal dysfunction and death in knock-in flies, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on approximately 130,000 cells from brains of Tau P251L mutant and control flies. We found that expression of disease-associated mutant tau altered gene expression cell autonomously in all neuronal cell types identified. Gene expression was also altered in glial cells, suggestive of non-cell-autonomous regulation. Cell signaling pathways, including glial-neuronal signaling, were broadly dysregulated as were brain region and cell type-specific protein interaction networks and gene regulatory programs. In summary, we present here a genetic model of tauopathy that faithfully recapitulates the genetic context and phenotypic features of the human disease, and use the results of comprehensive single-cell sequencing analysis to outline pathways of neurotoxicity and highlight the potential role of non-cell-autonomous changes in glia.
29481632	2019	Briefings in bioinformatics	Evaluation of tools for highly variable gene discovery from single-cell RNA-seq data.	Traditional RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) allows the detection of gene expression variations between two or more cell populations through differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis. However, genes that contribute to cell-to-cell differences are not discoverable with RNA-seq because RNA-seq samples are obtained from a mixture of cells. Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) allows the detection of gene expression in each cell. With scRNA-seq, highly variable gene (HVG) discovery allows the detection of genes that contribute strongly to cell-to-cell variation within a homogeneous cell population, such as a population of embryonic stem cells. This analysis is implemented in many software packages. In this study, we compare seven HVG methods from six software packages, including BASiCS, Brennecke, scLVM, scran, scVEGs and Seurat. Our results demonstrate that reproducibility in HVG analysis requires a larger sample size than DEG analysis. Discrepancies between methods and potential issues in these tools are discussed and recommendations are made.
35998893	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	CellDrift: inferring perturbation responses in temporally sampled single-cell data.	Cells and tissues respond to perturbations in multiple ways that can be sensitively reflected in the alterations of gene expression. Current approaches to finding and quantifying the effects of perturbations on cell-level responses over time disregard the temporal consistency of identifiable gene programs. To leverage the occurrence of these patterns for perturbation analyses, we developed CellDrift (https://github.com/KANG-BIOINFO/CellDrift), a generalized linear model-based functional data analysis method that is capable of identifying covarying temporal patterns of various cell types in response to perturbations. As compared to several other approaches, CellDrift demonstrated superior performance in the identification of temporally varied perturbation patterns and the ability to impute missing time points. We applied CellDrift to multiple longitudinal datasets, including COVID-19 disease progression and gastrointestinal tract development, and demonstrated its ability to identify specific gene programs associated with sequential biological processes, trajectories and outcomes.
36207601	2022	Nature biotechnology	Single-cell RNA-seq keeps cells alive.	
37337297	2023	Genome biology	The effect of background noise and its removal on the analysis of single-cell expression data.	BACKGROUND: In droplet-based single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq experiments, not all reads associated with one cell barcode originate from the encapsulated cell. Such background noise is attributed to spillage from cell-free ambient RNA or barcode swapping events. RESULTS: Here, we characterize this background noise exemplified by three scRNA-seq and two snRNA-seq replicates of mouse kidneys. For each experiment, cells from two mouse subspecies are pooled, allowing to identify cross-genotype contaminating molecules and thus profile background noise. Background noise is highly variable across replicates and cells, making up on average 3-35% of the total counts (UMIs) per cell and we find that noise levels are directly proportional to the specificity and detectability of marker genes. In search of the source of background noise, we find multiple lines of evidence that the majority of background molecules originates from ambient RNA. Finally, we use our genotype-based estimates to evaluate the performance of three methods (CellBender, DecontX, SoupX) that are designed to quantify and remove background noise. We find that CellBender provides the most precise estimates of background noise levels and also yields the highest improvement for marker gene detection. By contrast, clustering and classification of cells are fairly robust towards background noise and only small improvements can be achieved by background removal that may come at the cost of distortions in fine structure. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings help to better understand the extent, sources and impact of background noise in single-cell experiments and provide guidance on how to deal with it.
35395014	2022	PLoS computational biology	Using topic modeling to detect cellular crosstalk in scRNA-seq.	Cell-cell interactions are vital for numerous biological processes including development, differentiation, and response to inflammation. Currently, most methods for studying interactions on scRNA-seq level are based on curated databases of ligands and receptors. While those methods are useful, they are limited to our current biological knowledge. Recent advances in single cell protocols have allowed for physically interacting cells to be captured, and as such we have the potential to study interactions in a complemantary way without relying on prior knowledge. We introduce a new method based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for detecting genes that change as a result of interaction. We apply our method to synthetic datasets to demonstrate its ability to detect genes that change in an interacting population compared to a reference population. Next, we apply our approach to two datasets of physically interacting cells to identify the genes that change as a result of interaction, examples include adhesion and co-stimulatory molecules which confirm physical interaction between cells. For each dataset we produce a ranking of genes that are changing in subpopulations of the interacting cells. In addition to the genes discussed in the original publications, we highlight further candidates for interaction in the top 100 and 300 ranked genes. Lastly, we apply our method to a dataset generated by a standard droplet-based protocol not designed to capture interacting cells, and discuss its suitability for analysing interactions. We present a method that streamlines detection of interactions and does not require prior clustering and generation of synthetic reference profiles to detect changes in expression.
38619038	2024	Nucleic acids research	Fourteen years of cellular deconvolution: methodology, applications, technical evaluation and outstanding challenges.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) is a recent technology that allows for the measurement of the expression of all genes in each individual cell contained in a sample. Information at the single-cell level has been shown to be extremely useful in many areas. However, performing single-cell experiments is expensive. Although cellular deconvolution cannot provide the same comprehensive information as single-cell experiments, it can extract cell-type information from bulk RNA data, and therefore it allows researchers to conduct studies at cell-type resolution from existing bulk datasets. For these reasons, a great effort has been made to develop such methods for cellular deconvolution. The large number of methods available, the requirement of coding skills, inadequate documentation, and lack of performance assessment all make it extremely difficult for life scientists to choose a suitable method for their experiment. This paper aims to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive review of 53 deconvolution methods regarding their methodology, applications, performance, and outstanding challenges. More importantly, the article presents a benchmarking of all these 53 methods using 283 cell types from 30 tissues of 63 individuals. We also provide an R package named DeconBenchmark that allows readers to execute and benchmark the reviewed methods (https://github.com/tinnlab/DeconBenchmark).
28379537	2017	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	TASIC: determining branching models from time series single cell data.	MOTIVATION: Single cell RNA-Seq analysis holds great promise for elucidating the networks and pathways controlling cellular differentiation and disease. However, the analysis of time series single cell RNA-Seq data raises several new computational challenges. Cells at each time point are often sampled from a mixture of cell types, each of which may be a progenitor of one, or several, specific fates making it hard to determine which cells should be used to reconstruct temporal trajectories. In addition, cells, even from the same time point, may be unsynchronized making it hard to rely on the measured time for determining these trajectories. RESULTS: We present TASIC a new method for determining temporal trajectories, branching and cell assignments in single cell time series experiments. Unlike prior approaches TASIC uses on a probabilistic graphical model to integrate expression and time information making it more robust to noise and stochastic variations. Applying TASIC to in vitro myoblast differentiation and in-vivo lung development data we show that it accurately reconstructs developmental trajectories from single cell experiments. The reconstructed models enabled us to identify key genes involved in cell fate determination and to obtain new insights about a specific type of lung cells and its role in development. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The TASIC software package is posted in the supporting website. The datasets used in the paper are publicly available. CONTACT: zivbj@cs.cmu.edu. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
35706040	2022	Genome biology	SCADIE: simultaneous estimation of cell type proportions and cell type-specific gene expressions using SCAD-based iterative estimating procedure.	A challenge in bulk gene differential expression analysis is to differentiate changes due to cell type-specific gene expression and cell type proportions. SCADIE is an iterative algorithm that simultaneously estimates cell type-specific gene expression profiles and cell type proportions, and performs cell type-specific differential expression analysis at the group level. Through its unique penalty and objective function, SCADIE more accurately identifies cell type-specific differentially expressed genes than existing methods, including those that may be missed from single cell RNA-Seq data. SCADIE has robust performance with respect to the choice of deconvolution methods and the sources and quality of input data.
40347979	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	An overview of computational methods in single-cell transcriptomic cell type annotation.	The rapid accumulation of single-cell RNA sequencing data has provided unprecedented computational resources for cell type annotation, significantly advancing our understanding of cellular heterogeneity. Leveraging gene expression profiles derived from transcriptomic data, researchers can accurately infer cell types, sparking the development of numerous innovative annotation methods. These methods utilize a range of strategies, including marker genes, correlation-based matching, and supervised learning, to classify cell types. In this review, we systematically examine these annotation approaches based on transcriptomics-specific gene expression profiles and provide a comprehensive comparison and categorization of these methods. Furthermore, we focus on the main challenges in the annotation process, especially the long-tail distribution problem arising from data imbalance in rare cell types. We discuss the potential of deep learning techniques to address these issues and enhance model capability in recognizing novel cell types within an open-world framework.
40931362	2025	Genome biology	Single-cell atlas in the living fossil Yangtze sturgeon provides insight into the evolution of fish.	BACKGROUND: Fish are the largest group of vertebrates. Studying the characteristics, functions, and interactions of different fish cells is important for understanding their roles in disease and evolution. However, most single cell RNA-seq studies in fish are restricted to a few specific organs, leaving a comprehensive cell landscape that aims to characterize the heterogeneity and connections among body-wide organs largely unexplored. RESULTS: We construct a single-cell atlas from the Yangtze sturgeon, Acipenser dabryanus, containing 82,401 high-quality cells and identify 72 major cell types. We compare differentially expressed genes among enterocytes in each part of the intestines and reveal the differences in absorption function of pyloric caecum, duodenum, spiral intestine, and rectum. Best4/Otop2 cells, newly identified in human, are also found in the intestines of sturgeon, indicating that these cells originated in an ancient period. We confirm the status of Muller glia as resident stem cells in fish nervous systems. We also characterize the different immune function between mucosa- and systemic-associated tissues. We detect several unexpected types of cells in Yangtze sturgeon, confirming that sturgeon is basal to teleosts. Cross-species analysis further indicates that sturgeon might occupy an ancient evolutionary position bridging the transition from cartilaginous to bony fish. In addition, novel cell markers, transcription factors, and intercellular communications are identified and found to be associated with the biological functions of specific types of cells. CONCLUSION: We generate the cellular landscape of an ancient fish and provide a valuable resource for revealing the cellular heterogeneity and biology of vertebrates.
29688282	2018	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Two-phase differential expression analysis for single cell RNA-seq.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has brought the study of the transcriptome to higher resolution and makes it possible for scientists to provide answers with more clarity to the question of 'differential expression'. However, most computational methods still stick with the old mentality of viewing differential expression as a simple 'up or down' phenomenon. We advocate that we should fully embrace the features of single cell data, which allows us to observe binary (from Off to On) as well as continuous (the amount of expression) regulations. RESULTS: We develop a method, termed SC2P, that first identifies the phase of expression a gene is in, by taking into account of both cell- and gene-specific contexts, in a model-based and data-driven fashion. We then identify two forms of transcription regulation: phase transition, and magnitude tuning. We demonstrate that compared with existing methods, SC2P provides substantial improvement in sensitivity without sacrificing the control of false discovery, as well as better robustness. Furthermore, the analysis provides better interpretation of the nature of regulation types in different genes. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: SC2P is implemented as an open source R package publicly available at https://github.com/haowulab/SC2P. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
39821189	2025	PLoS computational biology	Integration of unpaired single cell omics data by deep transfer graph convolutional network.	The rapid advance of large-scale atlas-level single cell RNA sequences and single-cell chromatin accessibility data provide extraordinary avenues to broad and deep insight into complex biological mechanism. Leveraging the datasets and transfering labels from scRNA-seq to scATAC-seq will empower the exploration of single-cell omics data. However, the current label transfer methods have limited performance, largely due to the lower capable of preserving fine-grained cell populations and intrinsic or extrinsic heterogeneity between datasets. Here, we present a robust deep transfer model based graph convolutional network, scTGCN, which achieves versatile performance in preserving biological variation, while achieving integration hundreds of thousands cells in minutes with low memory consumption. We show that scTGCN is powerful to the integration of mouse atlas data and multimodal data generated from APSA-seq and CITE-seq. Thus, scTGCN shows high label transfer accuracy and effectively knowledge transfer across different modalities.
39814561	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Explainable deep neural networks for predicting sample phenotypes from single-cell transcriptomics.	Recent advances in single-cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-Seq) technologies have revolutionized our ability to gather molecular insights into different phenotypes at the level of individual cells. The analysis of the resulting data poses significant challenges, and proper statistical methods are required to analyze and extract information from scRNA-Seq datasets. Sample classification based on gene expression data has proven effective and valuable for precision medicine applications. However, standard classification schemas are often not suitable for scRNA-Seq due to their unique characteristics, and new algorithms are required to effectively analyze and classify samples at the single-cell level. Furthermore, existing methods for this purpose have limitations in their usability. Those reasons motivated us to develop singleDeep, an end-to-end pipeline that streamlines the analysis of scRNA-Seq data training deep neural networks, enabling robust prediction and characterization of sample phenotypes. We used singleDeep to make predictions on scRNA-Seq datasets from different conditions, including systemic lupus erythematosus, Alzheimer's disease and coronavirus disease 2019. Our results demonstrate strong diagnostic performance, validated both internally and externally. Moreover, singleDeep outperformed traditional machine learning methods and alternative single-cell approaches. In addition to prediction accuracy, singleDeep provides valuable insights into cell types and gene importance estimation for phenotypic characterization. This functionality provided additional and valuable information in our use cases. For instance, we corroborated that some interferon signature genes are consistently relevant for autoimmunity across all immune cell types in lupus. On the other hand, we discovered that genes linked to dementia have relevant roles in specific brain cell populations, such as APOE in astrocytes.
41286991	2025	Genome biology	scKGBERT: a knowledge-enhanced foundation model for single-cell transcriptomics.	Single-cell transcriptomics enables precise characterization of cellular heterogeneity, but current pre-trained models relying solely on expression data fail to capture gene associations. We present scKGBERT, a knowledge-enhanced foundation model integrating 41 M single-cell RNA-seq profiles and 8.9 M protein-protein interactions to jointly learn gene and cell representations. scKGBERT employs Gaussian attention to emphasize key genes and improve biomarker identification, achieving superior performance across gene annotation, drug response, and disease prediction tasks. scKGBERT enhances biological interpretability and offers a powerful resource for precision medicine and disease mechanism discovery.
37769630	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Self-supervised deep clustering of single-cell RNA-seq data to hierarchically detect rare cell populations.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a widely used technique for characterizing individual cells and studying gene expression at the single-cell level. Clustering plays a vital role in grouping similar cells together for various downstream analyses. However, the high sparsity and dimensionality of large scRNA-seq data pose challenges to clustering performance. Although several deep learning-based clustering algorithms have been proposed, most existing clustering methods have limitations in capturing the precise distribution types of the data or fully utilizing the relationships between cells, leaving a considerable scope for improving the clustering performance, particularly in detecting rare cell populations from large scRNA-seq data. We introduce DeepScena, a novel single-cell hierarchical clustering tool that fully incorporates nonlinear dimension reduction, negative binomial-based convolutional autoencoder for data fitting, and a self-supervision model for cell similarity enhancement. In comprehensive evaluation using multiple large-scale scRNA-seq datasets, DeepScena consistently outperformed seven popular clustering tools in terms of accuracy. Notably, DeepScena exhibits high proficiency in identifying rare cell populations within large datasets that contain large numbers of clusters. When applied to scRNA-seq data of multiple myeloma cells, DeepScena successfully identified not only previously labeled large cell types but also subpopulations in CD14 monocytes, T cells and natural killer cells, respectively.
37185897	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	A scalable unsupervised learning of scRNAseq data detects rare cells through integration of structure-preserving embedding, clustering and outlier detection.	Single-cell RNA-seq analysis has become a powerful tool to analyse the transcriptomes of individual cells. In turn, it has fostered the possibility of screening thousands of single cells in parallel. Thus, contrary to the traditional bulk measurements that only paint a macroscopic picture, gene measurements at the cell level aid researchers in studying different tissues and organs at various stages. However, accurate clustering methods for such high-dimensional data remain exiguous and a persistent challenge in this domain. Of late, several methods and techniques have been promulgated to address this issue. In this article, we propose a novel framework for clustering large-scale single-cell data and subsequently identifying the rare-cell sub-populations. To handle such sparse, high-dimensional data, we leverage PaCMAP (Pairwise Controlled Manifold Approximation), a feature extraction algorithm that preserves both the local and the global structures of the data and Gaussian Mixture Model to cluster single-cell data. Subsequently, we exploit Edited Nearest Neighbours sampling and Isolation Forest/One-class Support Vector Machine to identify rare-cell sub-populations. The performance of the proposed method is validated using the publicly available datasets with varying degrees of cell types and rare-cell sub-populations. On several benchmark datasets, the proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method successfully identifies cell types that constitute populations ranging from 0.1 to 8% with F1-scores of 0.91 0.09. The source code is available at https://github.com/scrab017/RarPG.
31134269	2019	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	snakePipes: facilitating flexible, scalable and integrative epigenomic analysis.

39073828	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Detecting novel cell type in single-cell chromatin accessibility data via open-set domain adaptation.	Recent advances in single-cell technologies enable the rapid growth of multi-omics data. Cell type annotation is one common task in analyzing single-cell data. It is a challenge that some cell types in the testing set are not present in the training set (i.e. unknown cell types). Most scATAC-seq cell type annotation methods generally assign each cell in the testing set to one known type in the training set but neglect unknown cell types. Here, we present OVAAnno, an automatic cell types annotation method which utilizes open-set domain adaptation to detect unknown cell types in scATAC-seq data. Comprehensive experiments show that OVAAnno successfully identifies known and unknown cell types. Further experiments demonstrate that OVAAnno also performs well on scRNA-seq data. Our codes are available online at https://github.com/lisaber/OVAAnno/tree/master.
37874950	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Quantum annealing-based clustering of single cell RNA-seq data.	Cluster analysis is a crucial stage in the analysis and interpretation of single-cell gene expression (scRNA-seq) data. It is an inherently ill-posed problem whose solutions depend heavily on hyper-parameter and algorithmic choice. The popular approach of K-means clustering, for example, depends heavily on the choice of K and the convergence of the expectation-maximization algorithm to local minima of the objective. Exhaustive search of the space for multiple good quality solutions is known to be a complex problem. Here, we show that quantum computing offers a solution to exploring the cost function of clustering by quantum annealing, implemented on a quantum computing facility offered by D-Wave [1]. Out formulation extracts minimum vertex cover of an affinity graph to sub-sample the cell population and quantum annealing to optimise the cost function. A distribution of low-energy solutions can thus be extracted, offering alternate hypotheses about how genes group together in their space of expressions.
31873725	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Causal network perturbations for instance-specific analysis of single cell and disease samples.	MOTIVATION: Complex diseases involve perturbation in multiple pathways and a major challenge in clinical genomics is characterizing pathway perturbations in individual samples. This can lead to patient-specific identification of the underlying mechanism of disease thereby improving diagnosis and personalizing treatment. Existing methods rely on external databases to quantify pathway activity scores. This ignores the data dependencies and that pathways are incomplete or condition-specific. RESULTS: ssNPA is a new approach for subtyping samples based on deregulation of their gene networks. ssNPA learns a causal graph directly from control data. Sample-specific network neighborhood deregulation is quantified via the error incurred in predicting the expression of each gene from its Markov blanket. We evaluate the performance of ssNPA on liver development single-cell RNA-seq data, where the correct cell timing is recovered; and two TCGA datasets, where ssNPA patient clusters have significant survival differences. In all analyses ssNPA consistently outperforms alternative methods, highlighting the advantage of network-based approaches.

41171131	2025	Nucleic acids research	CellSNVReg: a multidimensional resource for SNV-mediated regulatory perturbations in single-cell and spatial omics.	Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) represent the most prevalent form of genetic variation and can perturb gene regulation, RNA processing, and protein function across multiple molecular layers, ultimately altering cellular functional states and contributing to disease development. Here, we present CellSNVReg (http://bio-bigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/CellSNVReg/index.jsp), a comprehensive multidimensional resource systematically characterizing regulatory perturbations caused by SNVs at cell-type and spatial resolutions in humans. By integrating 4.6 million cellular profiles from scRNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, and scATAC-seq across normal, tumor, and other disease tissues, CellSNVReg identifies an average of over 70 000 regulatory perturbations per sample across six dimensions: miRNA-target, transcription factor (TF)-target, enhancer-target, RBP-target, protein-protein interaction, and neoantigen generation, and further characterizes differential expression of perturbed target genes together with associated perturbation networks. For each perturbation, CellSNVReg provides qualitative annotations and quantitative scores to assess SNV perturbation impact, potentially facilitating prioritization of candidate driver SNVs in disease-relevant contexts. To assess downstream functional consequences, the platform links SNV-perturbed targets to alterations in cell functions, states, stemness, metabolism, cell-cell communication, and drug repurposing. In summary, CellSNVReg offers a high-resolution framework for dissecting the functional impact of SNVs across diverse regulatory layers, enabling exploration of the landscape of SNV-mediated regulatory disruptions and their phenotypic consequences in normal and disease contexts.
32883324	2020	Genome biology	EPISCORE: cell type deconvolution of bulk tissue DNA methylomes from single-cell RNA-Seq data.	Cell type heterogeneity presents a challenge to the interpretation of epigenome data, compounded by the difficulty in generating reliable single-cell DNA methylomes for large numbers of cells and samples. We present EPISCORE, a computational algorithm that performs virtual microdissection of bulk tissue DNA methylation data at single cell-type resolution for any solid tissue. EPISCORE applies a probabilistic epigenetic model of gene regulation to a single-cell RNA-seq tissue atlas to generate a tissue-specific DNA methylation reference matrix, allowing quantification of cell-type proportions and cell-type-specific differential methylation signals in bulk tissue data. We validate EPISCORE in multiple epigenome studies and tissue types.
35485740	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Imputing dropouts for single-cell RNA sequencing based on multi-objective optimization.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have been testified revolutionary for their promotion on the profiling of single-cell transcriptomes at single-cell resolution. Excess zeros due to various technical noises, called dropouts, will mislead downstream analyses. Therefore, it is crucial to have accurate imputation methods to address the dropout problem. RESULTS: In this article, we develop a new dropout imputation method for scRNA-seq data based on multi-objective optimization. Our method is different from existing ones, which assume that the underlying data has a preconceived structure and impute the dropouts according to the information learned from such structure. We assume that the data combines three types of latent structures, including the horizontal structure (genes are similar to each other), the vertical structure (cells are similar to each other) and the low-rank structure. The combination weights and latent structures are learned using multi-objective optimization. And, the weighted average of the observed data and the imputation results learned from the three types of structures are considered as the final result. Comprehensive downstream experiments show the superiority of our method in terms of recovery of true gene expression profiles, differential expression analysis, cell clustering and cell trajectory inference. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The R package is available at https://github.com/Zhangxf-ccnu/scMOO and https://zenodo.org/record/5785195. The codes to reproduce the downstream analyses in this article can be found at https://github.com/Zhangxf-ccnu/scMOO_experiments_codes and https://zenodo.org/record/5786211. The detailed list of data sets used in the present study is represented in Supplementary Table S1 in the Supplementary materials.

34499096	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	PsiNorm: a scalable normalization for single-cell RNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables transcriptome-wide gene expression measurements at single-cell resolution providing a comprehensive view of the compositions and dynamics of tissue and organism development. The evolution of scRNA-seq protocols has led to a dramatic increase of cells throughput, exacerbating many of the computational and statistical issues that previously arose for bulk sequencing. In particular, with scRNA-seq data all the analyses steps, including normalization, have become computationally intensive, both in terms of memory usage and computational time. In this perspective, new accurate methods able to scale efficiently are desirable. RESULTS: Here, we propose PsiNorm, a between-sample normalization method based on the power-law Pareto distribution parameter estimate. Here, we show that the Pareto distribution well resembles scRNA-seq data, especially those coming from platforms that use unique molecular identifiers. Motivated by this result, we implement PsiNorm, a simple and highly scalable normalization method. We benchmark PsiNorm against seven other methods in terms of cluster identification, concordance and computational resources required. We demonstrate that PsiNorm is among the top performing methods showing a good trade-off between accuracy and scalability. Moreover, PsiNorm does not need a reference, a characteristic that makes it useful in supervised classification settings, in which new out-of-sample data need to be normalized. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: PsiNorm is implemented in the scone Bioconductor package and available at https://bioconductor.org/packages/scone/. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
37353813	2023	Genome biology	VarID2 quantifies gene expression noise dynamics and unveils functional heterogeneity of ageing hematopoietic stem cells.	Variability of gene expression due to stochasticity of transcription or variation of extrinsic signals, termed biological noise, is a potential driving force of cellular differentiation. Utilizing single-cell RNA-sequencing, we develop VarID2 for the quantification of biological noise at single-cell resolution. VarID2 reveals enhanced nuclear versus cytoplasmic noise, and distinct regulatory modes stratified by correlation between noise, expression, and chromatin accessibility. Noise levels are minimal in murine hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and increase during differentiation and ageing. Differential noise identifies myeloid-biased Dlk1+ long-term HSCs in aged mice with enhanced quiescence and self-renewal capacity. VarID2 reveals noise dynamics invisible to conventional single-cell transcriptome analysis.
36689467	2023	PLoS computational biology	Intra-tumor heterogeneity, turnover rate and karyotype space shape susceptibility to missegregation-induced extinction.	The phenotypic efficacy of somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) stems from their incidence per base pair of the genome, which is orders of magnitudes greater than that of point mutations. One mitotic event stands out in its potential to significantly change a cell's SCNA burden-a chromosome missegregation. A stochastic model of chromosome mis-segregations has been previously developed to describe the evolution of SCNAs of a single chromosome type. Building upon this work, we derive a general deterministic framework for modeling missegregations of multiple chromosome types. The framework offers flexibility to model intra-tumor heterogeneity in the SCNAs of all chromosomes, as well as in missegregation- and turnover rates. The model can be used to test how selection acts upon coexisting karyotypes over hundreds of generations. We use the model to calculate missegregation-induced population extinction (MIE) curves, that separate viable from non-viable populations as a function of their turnover- and missegregation rates. Turnover- and missegregation rates estimated from scRNA-seq data are then compared to theoretical predictions. We find convergence of theoretical and empirical results in both the location of MIE curves and the necessary conditions for MIE. When a dependency of missegregation rate on karyotype is introduced, karyotypes associated with low missegregation rates act as a stabilizing refuge, rendering MIE impossible unless turnover rates are exceedingly high. Intra-tumor heterogeneity, including heterogeneity in missegregation rates, increases as tumors progress, rendering MIE unlikely.
37898127	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Single-cell RNA-sequencing data clustering using variational graph attention auto-encoder with self-supervised leaning.	The emergence of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) technology makes it possible to capture their differences at the cellular level, which contributes to studying cell heterogeneity. By extracting, amplifying and sequencing the genome at the individual cell level, scRNA-seq can be used to identify unknown or rare cell types as well as genes differentially expressed in specific cell types under different conditions using clustering for downstream analysis of scRNA-seq. Many clustering algorithms have been developed with much progress. However, scRNA-seq often appears with characteristics of high dimensions, sparsity and even the case of dropout events', which make the performance of scRNA-seq data clustering unsatisfactory. To circumvent the problem, a new deep learning framework, termed variational graph attention auto-encoder (VGAAE), is constructed for scRNA-seq data clustering. In the proposed VGAAE, a multi-head attention mechanism is introduced to learn more robust low-dimensional representations for the original scRNA-seq data and then self-supervised learning is also recommended to refine the clusters, whose number can be automatically determined using Jaccard index. Experiments have been conducted on different datasets and results show that VGAAE outperforms some other state-of-the-art clustering methods.
37561814	2023	PLoS computational biology	SARS-CoV-2 infection perturbs enhancer mediated transcriptional regulation of key pathways.	Despite extensive studies on the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection, there is still a lack of understanding of the downstream epigenetic and regulatory alterations in infected cells. In this study, we investigated changes in enhancer acetylation in epithelial lung cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 and their influence on transcriptional regulation and pathway activity. To achieve this, we integrated and reanalyzed data of enhancer acetylation, ex-vivo infection and single cell RNA-seq data from human patients. Our findings revealed coordinated changes in enhancers and transcriptional networks. We found that infected cells lose the WT1 transcription factor and demonstrate disruption of WT1-bound enhancers and of their associated target genes. Downstream targets of WT1 are involved in the regulation of the Wnt signaling and the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, which indeed exhibit increased activation levels. These findings may provide a potential explanation for the development of pulmonary fibrosis, a lethal complication of COVID-19. Moreover, we revealed over-acetylated enhancers associated with upregulated genes involved in cell adhesion, which could contribute to cell-cell infection of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, we demonstrated that enhancers may play a role in the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and contribute to excessive inflammation in the lungs, a typical complication of COVID-19. Overall, our analysis provided novel insights into the cell-autonomous dysregulation of enhancer regulation caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, a step on the path to a deeper molecular understanding of the disease.
39373051	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	scDFN: enhancing single-cell RNA-seq clustering with deep fusion networks.	Single-cell ribonucleic acid sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology can be used to perform high-resolution analysis of the transcriptomes of individual cells. Therefore, its application has gained popularity for accurately analyzing the ever-increasing content of heterogeneous single-cell datasets. Central to interpreting scRNA-seq data is the clustering of cells to decipher transcriptomic diversity and infer cell behavior patterns. However, its complexity necessitates the application of advanced methodologies capable of resolving the inherent heterogeneity and limited gene expression characteristics of single-cell data. Herein, we introduce a novel deep learning-based algorithm for single-cell clustering, designated scDFN, which can significantly enhance the clustering of scRNA-seq data through a fusion network strategy. The scDFN algorithm applies a dual mechanism involving an autoencoder to extract attribute information and an improved graph autoencoder to capture topological nuances, integrated via a cross-network information fusion mechanism complemented by a triple self-supervision strategy. This fusion is optimized through a holistic consideration of four distinct loss functions. A comparative analysis with five leading scRNA-seq clustering methodologies across multiple datasets revealed the superiority of scDFN, as determined by better the Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) and the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) metrics. Additionally, scDFN demonstrated robust multi-cluster dataset performance and exceptional resilience to batch effects. Ablation studies highlighted the key roles of the autoencoder and the improved graph autoencoder components, along with the critical contribution of the four joint loss functions to the overall efficacy of the algorithm. Through these advancements, scDFN set a new benchmark in single-cell clustering and can be used as an effective tool for the nuanced analysis of single-cell transcriptomics.
32051003	2020	Genome biology	Robustness and applicability of transcription factor and pathway analysis tools on single-cell RNA-seq data.	BACKGROUND: Many functional analysis tools have been developed to extract functional and mechanistic insight from bulk transcriptome data. With the advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), it is in principle possible to do such an analysis for single cells. However, scRNA-seq data has characteristics such as drop-out events and low library sizes. It is thus not clear if functional TF and pathway analysis tools established for bulk sequencing can be applied to scRNA-seq in a meaningful way. RESULTS: To address this question, we perform benchmark studies on simulated and real scRNA-seq data. We include the bulk-RNA tools PROGENy, GO enrichment, and DoRothEA that estimate pathway and transcription factor (TF) activities, respectively, and compare them against the tools SCENIC/AUCell and metaVIPER, designed for scRNA-seq. For the in silico study, we simulate single cells from TF/pathway perturbation bulk RNA-seq experiments. We complement the simulated data with real scRNA-seq data upon CRISPR-mediated knock-out. Our benchmarks on simulated and real data reveal comparable performance to the original bulk data. Additionally, we show that the TF and pathway activities preserve cell type-specific variability by analyzing a mixture sample sequenced with 13 scRNA-seq protocols. We also provide the benchmark data for further use by the community. CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses suggest that bulk-based functional analysis tools that use manually curated footprint gene sets can be applied to scRNA-seq data, partially outperforming dedicated single-cell tools. Furthermore, we find that the performance of functional analysis tools is more sensitive to the gene sets than to the statistic used.
32614380	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Simulation, power evaluation and sample size recommendation for single-cell RNA-seq.	MOTIVATION: Determining the sample size for adequate power to detect statistical significance is a crucial step at the design stage for high-throughput experiments. Even though a number of methods and tools are available for sample size calculation for microarray and RNA-seq in the context of differential expression (DE), this topic in the field of single-cell RNA sequencing is understudied. Moreover, the unique data characteristics present in scRNA-seq such as sparsity and heterogeneity increase the challenge. RESULTS: We propose POWSC, a simulation-based method, to provide power evaluation and sample size recommendation for single-cell RNA-sequencing DE analysis. POWSC consists of a data simulator that creates realistic expression data, and a power assessor that provides a comprehensive evaluation and visualization of the power and sample size relationship. The data simulator in POWSC outperforms two other state-of-art simulators in capturing key characteristics of real datasets. The power assessor in POWSC provides a variety of power evaluations including stratified and marginal power analyses for DEs characterized by two forms (phase transition or magnitude tuning), under different comparison scenarios. In addition, POWSC offers information for optimizing the tradeoffs between sample size and sequencing depth with the same total reads. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: POWSC is an open-source R package available online at https://github.com/suke18/POWSC. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
38243313	2024	Genome biology	DeepVelo: deep learning extends RNA velocity to multi-lineage systems with cell-specific kinetics.	Existing RNA velocity estimation methods strongly rely on predefined dynamics and cell-agnostic constant transcriptional kinetic rates, assumptions often violated in complex and heterogeneous single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Using a graph convolution network, DeepVelo overcomes these limitations by generalizing RNA velocity to cell populations containing time-dependent kinetics and multiple lineages. DeepVelo infers time-varying cellular rates of transcription, splicing, and degradation, recovers each cell's stage in the differentiation process, and detects functionally relevant driver genes regulating these processes. Application to various developmental and pathogenic processes demonstrates DeepVelo's capacity to study complex differentiation and lineage decision events in heterogeneous scRNA-seq data.
35953080	2022	Nucleic acids research	Onepot-Seq: capturing single-cell transcriptomes simultaneously in a continuous medium via transient localization of mRNA.	The development of single-cell RNA-seq has broadened the spectrum for biological research by providing a high-resolution analysis of cellular heterogeneity. However, the requirement for sophisticated devices for the compartmentalization of cells has limited its widespread applicability. Here, we develop Onepot-Seq, a device-free method, that harnesses the transient localization of mRNA after lysis to capture single-cell transcriptomes simultaneously in a continuous fluid medium. In mixed-species experiments, we obtained high-quality single-cell profiles. Further, cell type-specific poly(A)-conjugated antibodies allow Onepot-Seq to effectively capture target cells in complex populations. Chemical perturbations to cells can be profiled by Onepot-Seq at single-cell resolution. Onepot-Seq should allow routine transcriptional profiling at single-cell resolution, accelerating clinical and scientific discoveries in many fields of science.
35135612	2022	Genome biology	Benchmarking clustering algorithms on estimating the number of cell types from single-cell RNA-sequencing data.	BACKGROUND: A key task in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data analysis is to accurately detect the number of cell types in the sample, which can be critical for downstream analyses such as cell type identification. Various scRNA-seq data clustering algorithms have been specifically designed to automatically estimate the number of cell types through optimising the number of clusters in a dataset. The lack of benchmark studies, however, complicates the choice of the methods. RESULTS: We systematically benchmark a range of popular clustering algorithms on estimating the number of cell types in a variety of settings by sampling from the Tabula Muris data to create scRNA-seq datasets with a varying number of cell types, varying number of cells in each cell type, and different cell type proportions. The large number of datasets enables us to assess the performance of the algorithms, covering four broad categories of approaches, from various aspects using a panel of criteria. We further cross-compared the performance on datasets with high cell numbers using Tabula Muris and Tabula Sapiens data. CONCLUSIONS: We identify the strengths and weaknesses of each method on multiple criteria including the deviation of estimation from the true number of cell types, variability of estimation, clustering concordance of cells to their predefined cell types, and running time and peak memory usage. We then summarise these results into a multi-aspect recommendation to the users. The proposed stability-based approach for estimating the number of cell types is implemented in an R package and is freely available from ( https://github.com/PYangLab/scCCESS ).
29069469	2018	Nucleic acids research	Polysome-profiling in small tissue samples.	Polysome-profiling is commonly used to study translatomes and applies laborious extraction of efficiently translated mRNA (associated with >3 ribosomes) from a large volume across many fractions. This property makes polysome-profiling inconvenient for larger experimental designs or samples with low RNA amounts. To address this, we optimized a non-linear sucrose gradient which reproducibly enriches for efficiently translated mRNA in only one or two fractions, thereby reducing sample handling 5-10-fold. The technique generates polysome-associated RNA with a quality reflecting the starting material and, when coupled with smart-seq2 single-cell RNA sequencing, translatomes in small tissues from biobanks can be obtained. Translatomes acquired using optimized non-linear gradients resemble those obtained with the standard approach employing linear gradients. Polysome-profiling using optimized non-linear gradients in serum starved HCT-116 cells with or without p53 showed that p53 status associates with changes in mRNA abundance and translational efficiency leading to changes in protein levels. Moreover, p53 status also induced translational buffering whereby changes in mRNA levels are buffered at the level of mRNA translation. Thus, here we present a polysome-profiling technique applicable to large study designs, primary cells and frozen tissue samples such as those collected in biobanks.
40012008	2025	Genome biology	Cross-species imputation and comparison of single-cell transcriptomic profiles.	Cross-species comparison and prediction of gene expression profiles are important to understand regulatory changes during evolution and to transfer knowledge learned from model organisms to humans. Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) profiles enable us to capture gene expression profiles with respect to variations among individual cells; however, cross-species comparison of scRNA-seq profiles is challenging because of data sparsity, batch effects, and the lack of one-to-one cell matching across species. Moreover, single-cell profiles are challenging to obtain in certain biological contexts, limiting the scope of hypothesis generation. Here we developed Icebear, a neural network framework that decomposes single-cell measurements into factors representing cell identity, species, and batch factors. Icebear enables accurate prediction of single-cell gene expression profiles across species, thereby providing high-resolution cell type and disease profiles in under-characterized contexts. Icebear also facilitates direct cross-species comparison of single-cell expression profiles for conserved genes that are located on the X chromosome in eutherian mammals but on autosomes in chicken. This comparison, for the first time, revealed evolutionary and diverse adaptations of X-chromosome upregulation in mammals.
37930831	2024	Nucleic acids research	DiSignAtlas: an atlas of human and mouse disease signatures based on bulk and single-cell transcriptomics.	Molecular signatures are usually sets of biomolecules that can serve as diagnostic, prognostic, predictive, or therapeutic markers for a specific disease. Omics data derived from various high-throughput molecular biology technologies offer global, unbiased and appropriately comparable data, which can be used to identify such molecular signatures. To address the need for comprehensive disease signatures, DiSignAtlas (http://www.inbirg.com/disignatlas/) was developed to provide transcriptomics-based signatures for a wide range of diseases. A total of 181 434 transcriptome profiles were manually curated from studies involving 1836 nonredundant disease types in humans and mice. Then, 10 306 comparison datasets comprising both disease and control samples, including 328 single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, were established. Furthermore, a total of 3 775 317 differentially expressed genes in humans and 1 723 674 in mice were identified as disease signatures by analysing transcriptome profiles using commonly used pipelines. In addition to providing multiple methods for the retrieval of disease signatures, DiSignAtlas provides downstream functional enrichment analysis, cell type analysis and signature correlation analysis between diseases or species when available. Moreover, multiple analytical and comparison tools for disease signatures are available. DiSignAtlas is expected to become a valuable resource for both bioscientists and bioinformaticians engaged in translational research.
40069819	2025	Genome biology	Single-cell RNA-seq data have prevalent blood contamination but can be rescued by Originator, a computational tool separating single-cell RNA-seq by genetic and contextual information.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from complex human tissues have prevalent blood cell contamination during the sample preparation process. They may also comprise cells of different genetic makeups. We propose a new computational framework, Originator, which deciphers single cells by genetic origin and separates immune cells of blood contamination from those of expected tissue-resident cells. We demonstrate the accuracy of Originator at separating immune cells from the blood and tissue as well as cells of different genetic origins, using a variety of artificially mixed and real datasets, including pancreatic cancer and placentas as examples.
37231261	2024	Nature biotechnology	Dictionary learning for integrative, multimodal and scalable single-cell analysis.	Mapping single-cell sequencing profiles to comprehensive reference datasets provides a powerful alternative to unsupervised analysis. However, most reference datasets are constructed from single-cell RNA-sequencing data and cannot be used to annotate datasets that do not measure gene expression. Here we introduce 'bridge integration', a method to integrate single-cell datasets across modalities using a multiomic dataset as a molecular bridge. Each cell in the multiomic dataset constitutes an element in a 'dictionary', which is used to reconstruct unimodal datasets and transform them into a shared space. Our procedure accurately integrates transcriptomic data with independent single-cell measurements of chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, DNA methylation and protein levels. Moreover, we demonstrate how dictionary learning can be combined with sketching techniques to improve computational scalability and harmonize 8.6 million human immune cell profiles from sequencing and mass cytometry experiments. Our approach, implemented in version 5 of our Seurat toolkit ( http://www.satijalab.org/seurat ), broadens the utility of single-cell reference datasets and facilitates comparisons across diverse molecular modalities.
40581357	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	dbscATAC: a resource of single-cell super-enhancers/enhancers and gene markers derived from scATAC-seq data.	MOTIVATION: scATAC-seq enables high-resolution mapping of cis-regulatory elements. It has been widely applied to uncover cell-type-specific regulatory networks and complement scRNA-seq analysis in numerous studies. However, a large number of datasets generated by scATAC-seq remain underutilized due to limited exploration of super-enhancers/typical enhancers and gene markers. A comprehensive resource enabling cell-type-specific annotation of cis-regulatory elements and their dynamic enhancer-gene linkages remains an urgent unmet need for scATAC-seq. RESULTS: We present dbscATAC, a specialized single-cell database for annotating super-enhancers, gene markers, and enhancer-gene interactions derived from scATAC-seq data. Using improved machine learning algorithms, we identified 213 835 super-enhancers across 520 tissue/cell types from three species, as well as 347 484 gene markers, 13 470 526 enhancers, and 10 402 346 enhancer-gene interactions derived from 1 668 076 single cells spanning 1028 tissue/cell types in 13 species. An easy-to-use online platform with multiple analytic modules and hierarchical query options was developed for searching, browsing and visualizing single-cell super-enhancers, enhancers, and gene markers. dbscATAC provides a comprehensive resource to facilitate the exploration of enhancer landscapes, gene regulation, and cell-type-specific characteristics in single-cell epigenomics. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The database with all the super-enhancer/enhancer annotation data is available at http://singlecelldb.com/dbscATAC/index.php. And the source code of dbscATAC for prediction of SEs, enhancers, and gene markers are available at https://github.com/EvansGao/dbscATAC.

32483332	2020	Nature methods	Targeted Perturb-seq enables genome-scale genetic screens in single cells.	The transcriptome contains rich information on molecular, cellular and organismal phenotypes. However, experimental and statistical limitations constrain sensitivity and throughput of genetic screening with single-cell transcriptomics readout. To overcome these limitations, we introduce targeted Perturb-seq (TAP-seq), a sensitive, inexpensive and platform-independent method focusing single-cell RNA-seq coverage on genes of interest, thereby increasing the sensitivity and scale of genetic screens by orders of magnitude. TAP-seq permits routine analysis of thousands of CRISPR-mediated perturbations within a single experiment, detects weak effects and lowly expressed genes, and decreases sequencing requirements by up to 50-fold. We apply TAP-seq to generate perturbation-based enhancer-target gene maps for 1,778 enhancers within 2.5% of the human genome. We thereby show that enhancer-target association is jointly determined by three-dimensional contact frequency and epigenetic states, allowing accurate prediction of enhancer targets throughout the genome. In addition, we demonstrate that TAP-seq can identify cell subtypes with only 100 sequencing reads per cell.
40662783	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Incorporating hierarchical information into multiple instance learning for patient phenotype prediction with single-cell RNA-sequencing data.	MOTIVATION: Multiple instance learning (MIL) provides a structured approach to patient phenotype prediction with single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. However, existing MIL methods tend to overlook the hierarchical structure inherent in scRNA-seq data, especially the biological groupings of cells or cell types. This limitation may lead to suboptimal performance and poor interpretability at higher levels of cellular division. RESULTS: To address this gap, we present a novel approach to incorporate hierarchical information into the attention-based MIL framework. Specifically, our model applies the attention-based aggregation mechanism over both cells and cell types, thus enforcing a hierarchical structure on the flow of information throughout the model. Across extensive experiments, our proposed approach demonstrates highly competitive performance and shows robustness against limited sample sizes. Moreover, ablation test results show that simply applying the attention mechanism on cell types instead of cells leads to improved performance, underscoring the benefits of incorporating the hierarchical groupings. By identifying the critical cell types that are most relevant for prediction, we show that our model is capable of capturing biologically meaningful associations, suggesting its potential to facilitate biological discoveries. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Our source code is available at https://github.com/minhchaudo/hier-mil. All datasets used in this study are publicly available online.
37592036	2024	Nature biotechnology	Predicting transcriptional outcomes of novel multigene perturbations with GEARS.	Understanding cellular responses to genetic perturbation is central to numerous biomedical applications, from identifying genetic interactions involved in cancer to developing methods for regenerative medicine. However, the combinatorial explosion in the number of possible multigene perturbations severely limits experimental interrogation. Here, we present graph-enhanced gene activation and repression simulator (GEARS), a method that integrates deep learning with a knowledge graph of gene-gene relationships to predict transcriptional responses to both single and multigene perturbations using single-cell RNA-sequencing data from perturbational screens. GEARS is able to predict outcomes of perturbing combinations consisting of genes that were never experimentally perturbed. GEARS exhibited 40% higher precision than existing approaches in predicting four distinct genetic interaction subtypes in a combinatorial perturbation screen and identified the strongest interactions twice as well as prior approaches. Overall, GEARS can predict phenotypically distinct effects of multigene perturbations and thus guide the design of perturbational experiments.
33349700	2021	Nature biotechnology	A multicenter study benchmarking single-cell RNA sequencing technologies using reference samples.	Comparing diverse single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets generated by different technologies and in different laboratories remains a major challenge. Here we address the need for guidance in choosing algorithms leading to accurate biological interpretations of varied data types acquired with different platforms. Using two well-characterized cellular reference samples (breast cancer cells and B cells), captured either separately or in mixtures, we compared different scRNA-seq platforms and several preprocessing, normalization and batch-effect correction methods at multiple centers. Although preprocessing and normalization contributed to variability in gene detection and cell classification, batch-effect correction was by far the most important factor in correctly classifying the cells. Moreover, scRNA-seq dataset characteristics (for example, sample and cellular heterogeneity and platform used) were critical in determining the optimal bioinformatic method. However, reproducibility across centers and platforms was high when appropriate bioinformatic methods were applied. Our findings offer practical guidance for optimizing platform and software selection when designing an scRNA-seq study.
39163479	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Identifying cancer cells from calling single-nucleotide variants in scRNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data are widely used to study cancer cell states and their heterogeneity. However, the tumour microenvironment is usually a mixture of healthy and cancerous cells and it can be difficult to fully separate these two populations based on transcriptomics alone. If available, somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) observed in the scRNA-seq data could be used to identify the cancer population and match that information with the single cells' expression profile. However, calling somatic SNVs in scRNA-seq data is a challenging task, as most variants seen in the short-read data are not somatic, but can instead be germline variants, RNA edits or transcription, sequencing, or processing errors. In addition, only variants present in actively transcribed regions for each individual cell will be seen in the data. RESULTS: To address these challenges, we develop CCLONE (Cancer Cell Labelling On Noisy Expression), an interpretable tool adapted to handle the uncertainty and sparsity of SNVs called from scRNA-seq data. CCLONE jointly identifies cancer clonal populations, and their associated variants. We apply CCLONE on two acute myeloid leukaemia datasets and one lung adenocarcinoma dataset and show that CCLONE captures both genetic clones and somatic events for multiple patients. These results show how CCLONE can be used to gather insight into the course of the disease and the origin of cancer cells in scRNA-seq data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Source code is available at github.com/HaghverdiLab/CCLONE.
37850657	2024	Nucleic acids research	CellCommuNet: an atlas of cell-cell communication networks from single-cell RNA sequencing of human and mouse tissues in normal and disease states.	Cell-cell communication, as a basic feature of multicellular organisms, is crucial for maintaining the biological functions and microenvironmental homeostasis of cells, organs, and whole organisms. Alterations in cell-cell communication contribute to many diseases, including cancers. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides a powerful method for studying cell-cell communication by enabling the analysis of ligand-receptor interactions. Here, we introduce CellCommuNet (http://www.inbirg.com/cellcommunet/), a comprehensive data resource for exploring cell-cell communication networks in scRNA-seq data from human and mouse tissues in normal and disease states. CellCommuNet currently includes 376 single datasets from multiple sources, and 118 comparison datasets between disease and normal samples originating from the same study. CellCommuNet provides information on the strength of communication between cells and related signalling pathways and facilitates the exploration of differences in cell-cell communication between healthy and disease states. Users can also search for specific signalling pathways, ligand-receptor pairs, and cell types of interest. CellCommuNet provides interactive graphics illustrating cell-cell communication in different states, enabling differential analysis of communication strength between disease and control samples. This comprehensive database aims to be a valuable resource for biologists studying cell-cell communication networks.

40843971	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Boosting data interpretation with GIBOOST to enhance visualization of complex high-dimensional data.	High-dimensional single-cell data analysis is crucial for understanding complex biological interactions, yet conventional dimensionality reduction methods (DRMs) often fail to preserve both global and local structures. Existing DRMs, such as t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Potential of Heat-diffusion for Affinity-based Transition Embedding (PHATE), optimize different visualization objectives, resulting in trade-offs between cluster separability, spatial organization, and temporal coherence. To overcome these limitations, we introduce GIBOOST, an AI-driven framework that integrates outputs from multiple DRMs using a Bayesian framework and an optimized autoencoder. GIBOOST systematically selects and integrates the two most informative DRMs by evaluating key visualization features, including separability, spatial continuity, uniformity, cellular dynamics, and cluster sensitivity. Rather than prioritizing a single DRM, it identifies the optimal combination that maximizes clustering sensitivity (GI) while preserving biologically relevant spatial and temporal structures. This integration is further refined through a GI-optimized autoencoder, which optimizes the joint distribution of GI, neuron count, and batch size effects to improve visualization quality. We demonstrate GIBOOST's efficacy across multiple dynamic biological processes, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition, CiPSC reprogramming, spermatogenesis, and placental development. Compared to nine individual DRMs, GIBOOST enhances clustering sensitivity and biological relevance by ~30%, enabling more accurate interpretation of differentiation trajectories and cell-cell interactions. When applied to a large single-cell RNA-seq dataset (~400 000 cells, 28 cell types, seven placental regions), GIBOOST uncovers novel immune-placenta interactions, providing deeper insights into cross-tissue communication during pregnancy. By improving both the visualization and interpretability of high-dimensional data, GIBOOST serves as a powerful tool for computational systems biology, enabling a more accurate exploration of complex cellular systems.
34850101	2022	Nucleic acids research	Enhancing biological signals and detection rates in single-cell RNA-seq experiments with cDNA library equalization.	Considerable effort has been devoted to refining experimental protocols to reduce levels of technical variability and artifacts in single-cell RNA-sequencing data (scRNA-seq). We here present evidence that equalizing the concentration of cDNA libraries prior to pooling, a step not consistently performed in single-cell experiments, improves gene detection rates, enhances biological signals, and reduces technical artifacts in scRNA-seq data. To evaluate the effect of equalization on various protocols, we developed Scaffold, a simulation framework that models each step of an scRNA-seq experiment. Numerical experiments demonstrate that equalization reduces variation in sequencing depth and gene-specific expression variability. We then performed a set of experiments in vitro with and without the equalization step and found that equalization increases the number of genes that are detected in every cell by 17-31%, improves discovery of biologically relevant genes, and reduces nuisance signals associated with cell cycle. Further support is provided in an analysis of publicly available data.
34500471	2021	Nucleic acids research	scDeepSort: a pre-trained cell-type annotation method for single-cell transcriptomics using deep learning with a weighted graph neural network.	Advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have furthered the simultaneous classification of thousands of cells in a single assay based on transcriptome profiling. In most analysis protocols, single-cell type annotation relies on marker genes or RNA-seq profiles, resulting in poor extrapolation. Still, the accurate cell-type annotation for single-cell transcriptomic data remains a great challenge. Here, we introduce scDeepSort (https://github.com/ZJUFanLab/scDeepSort), a pre-trained cell-type annotation tool for single-cell transcriptomics that uses a deep learning model with a weighted graph neural network (GNN). Using human and mouse scRNA-seq data resources, we demonstrate the high performance and robustness of scDeepSort in labeling 764 741 cells involving 56 human and 32 mouse tissues. Significantly, scDeepSort outperformed other known methods in annotating 76 external test datasets, reaching an 83.79% accuracy across 265 489 cells in humans and mice. Moreover, we demonstrate the universality of scDeepSort using more challenging datasets and using references from different scRNA-seq technology. Above all, scDeepSort is the first attempt to annotate cell types of scRNA-seq data with a pre-trained GNN model, which can realize the accurate cell-type annotation without additional references, i.e. markers or RNA-seq profiles.
30289442	2020	Briefings in bioinformatics	Quantifying Waddington's epigenetic landscape: a comparison of single-cell potency measures.	MOTIVATION: Estimating differentiation potency of single cells is a task of great biological and clinical significance, as it may allow identification of normal and cancer stem cell phenotypes. However, very few single-cell potency models have been proposed, and their robustness and reliability across independent studies have not yet been fully assessed. RESULTS: Using nine independent single-cell RNA-Seq experiments, we here compare four different single-cell potency models to each other, in their ability to discriminate cells that ought to differ in terms of differentiation potency. Two of the potency models approximate potency via network entropy measures that integrate the single-cell RNA-Seq profile of a cell with a protein interaction network. The comparison between the four models reveals that integration of RNA-Seq data with a protein interaction network dramatically improves the robustness and reliability of single-cell potency estimates. We demonstrate that underlying this robustness is a correlation relationship, according to which high differentiation potency is positively associated with overexpression of network hubs. We further show that overexpressed network hubs are strongly enriched for ribosomal mitochondrial proteins, suggesting that their mRNA levels may provide a universal marker of a cell's potency. Thus, this study provides novel systems-biological insight into cellular potency and may provide a foundation for improved models of differentiation potency with far-reaching implications for the discovery of novel stem cell or progenitor cell phenotypes.
33219685	2021	Nucleic acids research	Lnc2Cancer 3.0: an updated resource for experimentally supported lncRNA/circRNA cancer associations and web tools based on RNA-seq and scRNA-seq data.	An updated Lnc2Cancer 3.0 (http://www.bio-bigdata.net/lnc2cancer or http://bio-bigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/lnc2cancer) database, which includes comprehensive data on experimentally supported long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs) associated with human cancers. In addition, web tools for analyzing lncRNA expression by high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) are described. Lnc2Cancer 3.0 was updated with several new features, including (i) Increased cancer-associated lncRNA entries over the previous version. The current release includes 9254 lncRNA-cancer associations, with 2659 lncRNAs and 216 cancer subtypes. (ii) Newly adding 1049 experimentally supported circRNA-cancer associations, with 743 circRNAs and 70 cancer subtypes. (iii) Experimentally supported regulatory mechanisms of cancer-related lncRNAs and circRNAs, involving microRNAs, transcription factors (TF), genetic variants, methylation and enhancers were included. (iv) Appending experimentally supported biological functions of cancer-related lncRNAs and circRNAs including cell growth, apoptosis, autophagy, epithelial mesenchymal transformation (EMT), immunity and coding ability. (v) Experimentally supported clinical relevance of cancer-related lncRNAs and circRNAs in metastasis, recurrence, circulation, drug resistance, and prognosis was included. Additionally, two flexible online tools, including RNA-seq and scRNA-seq web tools, were developed to enable fast and customizable analysis and visualization of lncRNAs in cancers. Lnc2Cancer 3.0 is a valuable resource for elucidating the associations between lncRNA, circRNA and cancer.
41212919	2025	PLoS computational biology	Inferring pathway activity from single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data with PaaSc.	Recent advances in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics have revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity. However, translating high-dimensional data into functional pathway insights remains challenging. To address this obstacle, we developed PaaSc (Pathway activity analysis of Single-cell), a computational method for inferring pathway activity at single-cell resolution. PaaSc employs multiple correspondence analysis to simultaneously project cells and genes into a common latent space and selects pathway-associated dimensions through linear regression to infer pathway activity scores. We validated PaaSc across diverse benchmarking datasets, including those that jointly profiled protein and RNA levels, as well as large-scale cancer scRNA-seq cohorts. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, PaaSc demonstrated superior performance in multiple applications: scoring cell type-specific gene sets, identifying cell senescence-associated pathways, and exploring GWAS trait-associated cell types. Importantly, PaaSc maintained accuracy despite batch effects and demonstrated robust performance across different data modalities, including scATAC-seq and spatial transcriptomics data. Our results demonstrate that PaaSc accurately captures dynamic cellular states and spatial patterns, thereby advancing our understanding of cellular dynamics, aging, and disease mechanisms.
38386700	2024	PLoS computational biology	A novel batch-effect correction method for scRNA-seq data based on Adversarial Information Factorization.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology produces an unprecedented resolution at the level of a unique cell, raising great hopes in medicine. Nevertheless, scRNA-seq data suffer from high variations due to the experimental conditions, called batch effects, preventing any aggregated downstream analysis. Adversarial Information Factorization provides a robust batch-effect correction method that does not rely on prior knowledge of the cell types nor a specific normalization strategy while being adapted to any downstream analysis task. It compares to and even outperforms state-of-the-art methods in several scenarios: low signal-to-noise ratio, batch-specific cell types with few cells, and a multi-batches dataset with imbalanced batches and batch-specific cell types. Moreover, it best preserves the relative gene expression between cell types, yielding superior differential expression analysis results. Finally, in a more complex setting of a Leukemia cohort, our method preserved most of the underlying biological information for each patient while aligning the batches, improving the clustering metrics in the aggregated dataset.
29481549	2018	Nature methods	Bias, robustness and scalability in single-cell differential expression analysis.	Many methods have been used to determine differential gene expression from single-cell RNA (scRNA)-seq data. We evaluated 36 approaches using experimental and synthetic data and found considerable differences in the number and characteristics of the genes that are called differentially expressed. Prefiltering of lowly expressed genes has important effects, particularly for some of the methods developed for bulk RNA-seq data analysis. However, we found that bulk RNA-seq analysis methods do not generally perform worse than those developed specifically for scRNA-seq. We also present conquer, a repository of consistently processed, analysis-ready public scRNA-seq data sets that is aimed at simplifying method evaluation and reanalysis of published results. Each data set provides abundance estimates for both genes and transcripts, as well as quality control and exploratory analysis reports.
35179571	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	ACTIVA: realistic single-cell RNA-seq generation with automatic cell-type identification using introspective variational autoencoders.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) technologies allow for measurements of gene expression at a single-cell resolution. This provides researchers with a tremendous advantage for detecting heterogeneity, delineating cellular maps or identifying rare subpopulations. However, a critical complication remains: the low number of single-cell observations due to limitations by rarity of subpopulation, tissue degradation or cost. This absence of sufficient data may cause inaccuracy or irreproducibility of downstream analysis. In this work, we present Automated Cell-Type-informed Introspective Variational Autoencoder (ACTIVA): a novel framework for generating realistic synthetic data using a single-stream adversarial variational autoencoder conditioned with cell-type information. Within a single framework, ACTIVA can enlarge existing datasets and generate specific subpopulations on demand, as opposed to two separate models [such as single-cell GAN (scGAN) and conditional scGAN (cscGAN)]. Data generation and augmentation with ACTIVA can enhance scRNAseq pipelines and analysis, such as benchmarking new algorithms, studying the accuracy of classifiers and detecting marker genes. ACTIVA will facilitate analysis of smaller datasets, potentially reducing the number of patients and animals necessary in initial studies. RESULTS: We train and evaluate models on multiple public scRNAseq datasets. In comparison to GAN-based models (scGAN and cscGAN), we demonstrate that ACTIVA generates cells that are more realistic and harder for classifiers to identify as synthetic which also have better pair-wise correlation between genes. Data augmentation with ACTIVA significantly improves classification of rare subtypes (more than 45% improvement compared with not augmenting and 4% better than cscGAN) all while reducing run-time by an order of magnitude in comparison to both models. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The codes and datasets are hosted on Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5879639). Tutorials are available at https://github.com/SindiLab/ACTIVA. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
34374742	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	Supervised application of internal validation measures to benchmark dimensionality reduction methods in scRNA-seq data.	A typical single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiment will measure on the order of 20 000 transcripts and thousands, if not millions, of cells. The high dimensionality of such data presents serious complications for traditional data analysis methods and, as such, methods to reduce dimensionality play an integral role in many analysis pipelines. However, few studies have benchmarked the performance of these methods on scRNA-seq data, with existing comparisons assessing performance via downstream analysis accuracy measures, which may confound the interpretation of their results. Here, we present the most comprehensive benchmark of dimensionality reduction methods in scRNA-seq data to date, utilizing over 300 000 compute hours to assess the performance of over 25 000 low-dimension embeddings across 33 dimensionality reduction methods and 55 scRNA-seq datasets. We employ a simple, yet novel, approach, which does not rely on the results of downstream analyses. Internal validation measures (IVMs), traditionally used as an unsupervised method to assess clustering performance, are repurposed to measure how well-formed biological clusters are after dimensionality reduction. Performance was further evaluated over nearly 200 000 000 iterations of DBSCAN, a density-based clustering algorithm, showing that hyperparameter optimization using IVMs as the objective function leads to near-optimal clustering. Methods were also assessed on the extent to which they preserve the global structure of the data, and on their computational memory and time requirements across a large range of sample sizes. Our comprehensive benchmarking analysis provides a valuable resource for researchers and aims to guide best practice for dimensionality reduction in scRNA-seq analyses, and we highlight Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Potential of Heat-diffusion for Affinity-based Transition Embedding as high-performing algorithms.
33524142	2021	Nucleic acids research	Flexible comparison of batch correction methods for single-cell RNA-seq using BatchBench.	As the cost of single-cell RNA-seq experiments has decreased, an increasing number of datasets are now available. Combining newly generated and publicly accessible datasets is challenging due to non-biological signals, commonly known as batch effects. Although there are several computational methods available that can remove batch effects, evaluating which method performs best is not straightforward. Here, we present BatchBench (https://github.com/cellgeni/batchbench), a modular and flexible pipeline for comparing batch correction methods for single-cell RNA-seq data. We apply BatchBench to eight methods, highlighting their methodological differences and assess their performance and computational requirements through a compendium of well-studied datasets. This systematic comparison guides users in the choice of batch correction tool, and the pipeline makes it easy to evaluate other datasets.
36063454	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	CCPLS reveals cell-type-specific spatial dependence of transcriptomes in single cells.	MOTIVATION: Cell-cell communications regulate internal cellular states, e.g. gene expression and cell functions, and play pivotal roles in normal development and disease states. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing methods have revealed cell-to-cell expression variability of highly variable genes (HVGs), which is also crucial. Nevertheless, the regulation of cell-to-cell expression variability of HVGs via cell-cell communications is still largely unexplored. The recent advent of spatial transcriptome methods has linked gene expression profiles to the spatial context of single cells, which has provided opportunities to reveal those regulations. The existing computational methods extract genes with expression levels influenced by neighboring cell types. However, limitations remain in the quantitativeness and interpretability: they neither focus on HVGs nor consider the effects of multiple neighboring cell types. RESULTS: Here, we propose CCPLS (Cell-Cell communications analysis by Partial Least Square regression modeling), which is a statistical framework for identifying cell-cell communications as the effects of multiple neighboring cell types on cell-to-cell expression variability of HVGs, based on the spatial transcriptome data. For each cell type, CCPLS performs PLS regression modeling and reports coefficients as the quantitative index of the cell-cell communications. Evaluation using simulated data showed our method accurately estimated the effects of multiple neighboring cell types on HVGs. Furthermore, applications to the two real datasets demonstrate that CCPLS can extract biologically interpretable insights from the inferred cell-cell communications. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The R package is available at https://github.com/bioinfo-tsukuba/CCPLS. The data are available at https://github.com/bioinfo-tsukuba/CCPLS_paper. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
38760566	2025	Nature biotechnology	Bidirectional epigenetic editing reveals hierarchies in gene regulation.	CRISPR perturbation methods are limited in their ability to study non-coding elements and genetic interactions. In this study, we developed a system for bidirectional epigenetic editing, called CRISPRai, in which we apply activating (CRISPRa) and repressive (CRISPRi) perturbations to two loci simultaneously in the same cell. We developed CRISPRai Perturb-seq by coupling dual perturbation gRNA detection with single-cell RNA sequencing, enabling study of pooled perturbations in a mixed single-cell population. We applied this platform to study the genetic interaction between two hematopoietic lineage transcription factors, SPI1 and GATA1, and discovered novel characteristics of their co-regulation on downstream target genes, including differences in SPI1 and GATA1 occupancy at genes that are regulated through different modes. We also studied the regulatory landscape of IL2 (interleukin-2) in Jurkat T cells, primary T cells and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells and elucidated mechanisms of enhancer-mediated IL2 gene regulation. CRISPRai facilitates investigation of context-specific genetic interactions, provides new insights into gene regulation and will enable exploration of non-coding disease-associated variants.
37735263	2024	Nature biotechnology	Detection of transcriptome-wide microRNA-target interactions in single cells with agoTRIBE.	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) exert their gene regulatory effects on numerous biological processes based on their selection of target transcripts. Current experimental methods available to identify miRNA targets are laborious and require millions of cells. Here we have overcome these limitations by fusing the miRNA effector protein Argonaute2 to the RNA editing domain of ADAR2, allowing the detection of miRNA targets transcriptome-wide in single cells. miRNAs guide the fusion protein to their natural target transcripts, causing them to undergo A>I editing, which can be detected by sensitive single-cell RNA sequencing. We show that agoTRIBE identifies functional miRNA targets, which are supported by evolutionary sequence conservation. In one application of the method we study microRNA interactions in single cells and identify substantial differential targeting across the cell cycle. AgoTRIBE also provides transcriptome-wide measurements of RNA abundance and allows the deconvolution of miRNA targeting in complex tissues at the single-cell level.
31501550	2019	Nature methods	Probabilistic cell-type assignment of single-cell RNA-seq for tumor microenvironment profiling.	Single-cell RNA sequencing has enabled the decomposition of complex tissues into functionally distinct cell types. Often, investigators wish to assign cells to cell types through unsupervised clustering followed by manual annotation or via 'mapping' to existing data. However, manual interpretation scales poorly to large datasets, mapping approaches require purified or pre-annotated data and both are prone to batch effects. To overcome these issues, we present CellAssign, a probabilistic model that leverages prior knowledge of cell-type marker genes to annotate single-cell RNA sequencing data into predefined or de novo cell types. CellAssign automates the process of assigning cells in a highly scalable manner across large datasets while controlling for batch and sample effects. We demonstrate the advantages of CellAssign through extensive simulations and analysis of tumor microenvironment composition in high-grade serous ovarian cancer and follicular lymphoma.
26084335	2015	Genome biology	Single-cell mRNA sequencing identifies subclonal heterogeneity in anti-cancer drug responses of lung adenocarcinoma cells.	BACKGROUND: Intra-tumoral genetic and functional heterogeneity correlates with cancer clinical prognoses. However, the mechanisms by which intra-tumoral heterogeneity impacts therapeutic outcome remain poorly understood. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of single tumor cells can provide comprehensive information about gene expression and single-nucleotide variations in individual tumor cells, which may allow for the translation of heterogeneous tumor cell functional responses into customized anti-cancer treatments. RESULTS: We isolated 34 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumor cells from a lung adenocarcinoma patient tumor xenograft. Individual tumor cells were subjected to single cell RNA-seq for gene expression profiling and expressed mutation profiling. Fifty tumor-specific single-nucleotide variations, including KRAS(G12D), were observed to be heterogeneous in individual PDX cells. Semi-supervised clustering, based on KRAS(G12D) mutant expression and a risk score representing expression of 69 lung adenocarcinoma-prognostic genes, classified PDX cells into four groups. PDX cells that survived in vitro anti-cancer drug treatment displayed transcriptome signatures consistent with the group characterized by KRAS(G12D) and low risk score. CONCLUSIONS: Single-cell RNA-seq on viable PDX cells identified a candidate tumor cell subgroup associated with anti-cancer drug resistance. Thus, single-cell RNA-seq is a powerful approach for identifying unique tumor cell-specific gene expression profiles which could facilitate the development of optimized clinical anti-cancer strategies.
39797728	2025	Nucleic acids research	inDrops-2: a flexible, versatile and cost-efficient droplet microfluidic approach for high-throughput scRNA-seq of fresh and preserved clinical samples.	The expansion of single-cell analytical techniques has empowered the exploration of diverse biological questions at the individual cells. Droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) methods have been particularly widely used due to their high-throughput capabilities and small reaction volumes. While commercial systems have contributed to the widespread adoption of droplet-based scRNA-seq, their relatively high cost limits the ability to profile large numbers of cells and samples. Moreover, as the scale of single-cell sequencing continues to expand, accommodating diverse workflows and cost-effective multi-biospecimen profiling becomes more critical. Herein, we present inDrops-2, an open-source scRNA-seq technology designed to profile live or preserved cells with a sensitivity matching that of state-of-the-art commercial systems but at a 6-fold lower cost. We demonstrate the flexibility of inDrops-2, by implementing two prominent scRNA-seq protocols, based on exponential and linear amplification of barcoded-complementary DNA, and provide useful insights into the advantages and disadvantages inherent to each approach. We applied inDrops-2 to simultaneously profile multiple human lung carcinoma samples that had been subjected to cell preservation, long-term storage and multiplexing to obtain a multiregional cellular profile of the tumor microenvironment. The scalability, sensitivity and cost efficiency make inDrops-2 stand out among other droplet-based scRNA-seq methods, ideal for large-scale studies on rare cell molecular signatures.
38701413	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	scEWE: high-order element-wise weighted ensemble clustering for heterogeneity analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data.	With the emergence of large amount of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, the exploration of computational methods has become critical in revealing biological mechanisms. Clustering is a representative for deciphering cellular heterogeneity embedded in scRNA-seq data. However, due to the diversity of datasets, none of the existing single-cell clustering methods shows overwhelming performance on all datasets. Weighted ensemble methods are proposed to integrate multiple results to improve heterogeneity analysis performance. These methods are usually weighted by considering the reliability of the base clustering results, ignoring the performance difference of the same base clustering on different cells. In this paper, we propose a high-order element-wise weighting strategy based self-representative ensemble learning framework: scEWE. By assigning different base clustering weights to individual cells, we construct and optimize the consensus matrix in a careful and exquisite way. In addition, we extracted the high-order information between cells, which enhanced the ability to represent the similarity relationship between cells. scEWE is experimentally shown to significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods, which strongly demonstrates the effectiveness of the method and supports the potential applications in complex single-cell data analytical problems.
40775355	2025	Genome biology	scTail: precise polyadenylation site detection and its alternative usage analysis from reads 1 preserved 3' scRNA-seq data.	The first-strand reads (often reads 1) of three-prime single-cell RNA-seq (3' scRNA-seq) can contain informative cDNA for analysis of polyadenylation sites (PAS), but are often overlooked or trimmed. Here, we describe a computational method, scTail, to identify PAS using first-strand reads and quantify its expression leveraging second-strand reads, consequently enabling detection of alternative PAS usage. Compared with other methods, scTail detects PAS more precisely and retains high sensitivity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that combining scTail and BRIE2 can discover differential alternative PAS usage in various biological processes including cancers and time-series development, giving critical insight into PAS regulation.
35188181	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis based on non-uniform epsilon-neighborhood network.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology provides the possibility to study cell heterogeneity and cell development on the resolution of individual cells. Arguably, three of the most important computational targets on scRNA-seq data analysis are data visualization, cell clustering and trajectory inference. Although a substantial number of algorithms have been developed, most of them do not treat the three targets in a systematic or consistent manner. RESULTS: In this article, we propose an efficient scRNA-seq analysis framework, which accomplishes the three targets consistently by non-uniform epsilon-neighborhood (NEN) network. First, a network is generated by our NEN method, which combines the advantages of both k-nearest neighbors (KNN) and epsilon-neighborhood (EN) to represent the manifold that data points reside in gene space. Then from such a network, we use its layout, its community and further its shortest path to achieve the purpose of scRNA-seq data visualization, clustering and trajectory inference. The results on both synthetic and real datasets indicate that our NEN method not only can visually provide the global topological structure of a dataset accurately compared with t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) and UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection), but also has superior performances on clustering and pseudotime ordering of cells over the existing approaches. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: This analysis method has been made into a python package called ccnet and is freely available at https://github.com/Just-Jia/ccNet. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
31892341	2019	Genome biology	scRNA-seq assessment of the human lung, spleen, and esophagus tissue stability after cold preservation.	BACKGROUND: The Human Cell Atlas is a large international collaborative effort to map all cell types of the human body. Single-cell RNA sequencing can generate high-quality data for the delivery of such an atlas. However, delays between fresh sample collection and processing may lead to poor data and difficulties in experimental design. RESULTS: This study assesses the effect of cold storage on fresh healthy spleen, esophagus, and lung from >/= 5 donors over 72 h. We collect 240,000 high-quality single-cell transcriptomes with detailed cell type annotations and whole genome sequences of donors, enabling future eQTL studies. Our data provide a valuable resource for the study of these 3 organs and will allow cross-organ comparison of cell types. We see little effect of cold ischemic time on cell yield, total number of reads per cell, and other quality control metrics in any of the tissues within the first 24 h. However, we observe a decrease in the proportions of lung T cells at 72 h, higher percentage of mitochondrial reads, and increased contamination by background ambient RNA reads in the 72-h samples in the spleen, which is cell type specific. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we present robust protocols for tissue preservation for up to 24 h prior to scRNA-seq analysis. This greatly facilitates the logistics of sample collection for Human Cell Atlas or clinical studies since it increases the time frames for sample processing.
38578796	2024	PLoS computational biology	Partial label learning for automated classification of single-cell transcriptomic profiles.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNASeq) data plays a major role in advancing our understanding of developmental biology. An important current question is how to classify transcriptomic profiles obtained from scRNASeq experiments into the various cell types and identify the lineage relationship for individual cells. Because of the fast accumulation of datasets and the high dimensionality of the data, it has become challenging to explore and annotate single-cell transcriptomic profiles by hand. To overcome this challenge, automated classification methods are needed. Classical approaches rely on supervised training datasets. However, due to the difficulty of obtaining data annotated at single-cell resolution, we propose instead to take advantage of partial annotations. The partial label learning framework assumes that we can obtain a set of candidate labels containing the correct one for each data point, a simpler setting than requiring a fully supervised training dataset. We study and extend when needed state-of-the-art multi-class classification methods, such as SVM, kNN, prototype-based, logistic regression and ensemble methods, to the partial label learning framework. Moreover, we study the effect of incorporating the structure of the label set into the methods. We focus particularly on the hierarchical structure of the labels, as commonly observed in developmental processes. We show, on simulated and real datasets, that these extensions enable to learn from partially labeled data, and perform predictions with high accuracy, particularly with a nonlinear prototype-based method. We demonstrate that the performances of our methods trained with partially annotated data reach the same performance as fully supervised data. Finally, we study the level of uncertainty present in the partially annotated data, and derive some prescriptive results on the effect of this uncertainty on the accuracy of the partial label learning methods. Overall our findings show how hierarchical and non-hierarchical partial label learning strategies can help solve the problem of automated classification of single-cell transcriptomic profiles, interestingly these methods rely on a much less stringent type of annotated datasets compared to fully supervised learning methods.
34016135	2021	Genome biology	MichiGAN: sampling from disentangled representations of single-cell data using generative adversarial networks.	Deep generative models such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) generate and manipulate high-dimensional images. We systematically assess the complementary strengths and weaknesses of these models on single-cell gene expression data. We also develop MichiGAN, a novel neural network that combines the strengths of VAEs and GANs to sample from disentangled representations without sacrificing data generation quality. We learn disentangled representations of three large single-cell RNA-seq datasets and use MichiGAN to sample from these representations. MichiGAN allows us to manipulate semantically distinct aspects of cellular identity and predict single-cell gene expression response to drug treatment.
35136924	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	scHFC: a hybrid fuzzy clustering method for single-cell RNA-seq data optimized by natural computation.	Rapid development of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has allowed researchers to explore biological phenomena at the cellular scale. Clustering is a crucial and helpful step for researchers to study the heterogeneity of cell. Although many clustering methods have been proposed, massive dropout events and the curse of dimensionality in scRNA-seq data make it still difficult to analysis because they reduce the accuracy of clustering methods, leading to misidentification of cell types. In this work, we propose the scHFC, which is a hybrid fuzzy clustering method optimized by natural computation based on Fuzzy C Mean (FCM) and Gath-Geva (GG) algorithms. Specifically, principal component analysis algorithm is utilized to reduce the dimensions of scRNA-seq data after it is preprocessed. Then, FCM algorithm optimized by simulated annealing algorithm and genetic algorithm is applied to cluster the data to output a membership matrix, which represents the initial clustering result and is taken as the input for GG algorithm to get the final clustering results. We also develop a cluster number estimation method called multi-index comprehensive estimation, which can estimate the cluster numbers well by combining four clustering effectiveness indexes. The performance of the scHFC method is evaluated on 17 scRNA-seq datasets, and compared with six state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results validate the better performance of our scHFC method in terms of clustering accuracy and stability of algorithm. In short, scHFC is an effective method to cluster cells for scRNA-seq data, and it presents great potential for downstream analysis of scRNA-seq data.

39584702	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	BioDSNN: a dual-stream neural network with hybrid biological knowledge integration for multi-gene perturbation response prediction.	Studying the outcomes of genetic perturbation based on single-cell RNA-seq data is crucial for understanding genetic regulation of cells. However, the high cost of cellular experiments and single-cell sequencing restrict us from measuring the full combination space of genetic perturbations and cell types. Consequently, a bunch of computational models have been proposed to predict unseen combinations based on existing data. Among them, generative models, e.g. variational autoencoder and diffusion models, have the superiority in capturing the perturbed data distribution, but lack a biologically understandable foundation for generalization. On the other side of the spectrum, Gene Regulation Networks or gene pathway knowledge have been exploited for more reasonable generalization enhancement. Unfortunately, they do not reach a balanced processing of the two data modalities, leading to a degraded fitting ability. Hence, we propose a dual-stream architecture. Before the information from two modalities are merged, the sequencing data are learned with a generative model while three types of knowledge data are comprehensively processed with graph networks and a masked transformer, enforcing a deep understanding of single-modality data, respectively. The benchmark results show an approximate 20% reduction in terms of mean squared error, proving the effectiveness of the model.
28541377	2017	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	ASAP: a web-based platform for the analysis and interactive visualization of single-cell RNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows whole transcriptome profiling of thousands of individual cells, enabling the molecular exploration of tissues at the cellular level. Such analytical capacity is of great interest to many research groups in the world, yet these groups often lack the expertise to handle complex scRNA-seq datasets. RESULTS: We developed a fully integrated, web-based platform aimed at the complete analysis of scRNA-seq data post genome alignment: from the parsing, filtering and normalization of the input count data files, to the visual representation of the data, identification of cell clusters, differentially expressed genes (including cluster-specific marker genes), and functional gene set enrichment. This Automated Single-cell Analysis Pipeline (ASAP) combines a wide range of commonly used algorithms with sophisticated visualization tools. Compared with existing scRNA-seq analysis platforms, researchers (including those lacking computational expertise) are able to interact with the data in a straightforward fashion and in real time. Furthermore, given the overlap between scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq analysis workflows, ASAP should conceptually be broadly applicable to any RNA-seq dataset. As a validation, we demonstrate how we can use ASAP to simply reproduce the results from a single-cell study of 91 mouse cells involving five distinct cell types. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The tool is freely available at asap.epfl.ch and R/Python scripts are available at github.com/DeplanckeLab/ASAP. CONTACT: bart.deplancke@epfl.ch. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
38366925	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scSemiGCN: boosting cell-type annotation from noise-resistant graph neural networks with extremely limited supervision.	MOTIVATION: Cell-type annotation is fundamental in revealing cell heterogeneity for single-cell data analysis. Although a host of works have been developed, the low signal-to-noise-ratio single-cell RNA-sequencing data that suffers from batch effects and dropout still poses obstacles in discovering grouped patterns for cell types by unsupervised learning and its alternative-semi-supervised learning that utilizes a few labeled cells as guidance for cell-type annotation. RESULTS: We propose a robust cell-type annotation method scSemiGCN based on graph convolutional networks. Built upon a denoised network structure that characterizes reliable cell-to-cell connections, scSemiGCN generates pseudo labels for unannotated cells. Then supervised contrastive learning follows to refine the noisy single-cell data. Finally, message passing with the refined features over the denoised network structure is conducted for semi-supervised cell-type annotation. Comparison over several datasets with six methods under extremely limited supervision validates the effectiveness and efficiency of scSemiGCN for cell-type annotation. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Implementation of scSemiGCN is available at https://github.com/Jane9898/scSemiGCN.
33622385	2021	Genome biology	MEDALT: single-cell copy number lineage tracing enabling gene discovery.	We present a Minimal Event Distance Aneuploidy Lineage Tree (MEDALT) algorithm that infers the evolution history of a cell population based on single-cell copy number (SCCN) profiles, and a statistical routine named lineage speciation analysis (LSA), whichty facilitates discovery of fitness-associated alterations and genes from SCCN lineage trees. MEDALT appears more accurate than phylogenetics approaches in reconstructing copy number lineage. From data from 20 triple-negative breast cancer patients, our approaches effectively prioritize genes that are essential for breast cancer cell fitness and predict patient survival, including those implicating convergent evolution.The source code of our study is available at https://github.com/KChen-lab/MEDALT .
35380614	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	SPCS: a spatial and pattern combined smoothing method for spatial transcriptomic expression.	High-dimensional, localized ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing is now possible owing to recent developments in spatial transcriptomics (ST). ST is based on highly multiplexed sequence analysis and uses barcodes to match the sequenced reads to their respective tissue locations. ST expression data suffer from high noise and dropout events; however, smoothing techniques have the promise to improve the data interpretability prior to performing downstream analyses. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data similarly suffer from these limitations, and smoothing methods developed for scRNA-seq can only utilize associations in transcriptome space (also known as one-factor smoothing methods). Since they do not account for spatial relationships, these one-factor smoothing methods cannot take full advantage of ST data. In this study, we present a novel two-factor smoothing technique, spatial and pattern combined smoothing (SPCS), that employs the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) technique to utilize information from transcriptome and spatial relationships. By performing SPCS on multiple ST slides from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and simulated high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) datasets, smoothed ST slides have better separability, partition accuracy and biological interpretability than the ones smoothed by preexisting one-factor methods. Source code of SPCS is provided in Github (https://github.com/Usos/SPCS).
35314812	2022	Nature biotechnology	Spatial charting of single-cell transcriptomes in tissues.	Single-cell RNA sequencing methods can profile the transcriptomes of single cells but cannot preserve spatial information. Conversely, spatial transcriptomics assays can profile spatial regions in tissue sections, but do not have single-cell resolution. Here, we developed a computational method called CellTrek that combines these two datasets to achieve single-cell spatial mapping through coembedding and metric learning approaches. We benchmarked CellTrek using simulation and in situ hybridization datasets, which demonstrated its accuracy and robustness. We then applied CellTrek to existing mouse brain and kidney datasets and showed that CellTrek can detect topological patterns of different cell types and cell states. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics experiments on two ductal carcinoma in situ tissues and applied CellTrek to identify tumor subclones that were restricted to different ducts, and specific T cell states adjacent to the tumor areas. Our data show that CellTrek can accurately map single cells in diverse tissue types to resolve their spatial organization.
32518404	2020	Nature biotechnology	Single-cell RNA counting at allele and isoform resolution using Smart-seq3.	Large-scale sequencing of RNA from individual cells can reveal patterns of gene, isoform and allelic expression across cell types and states(1). However, current short-read single-cell RNA-sequencing methods have limited ability to count RNAs at allele and isoform resolution, and long-read sequencing techniques lack the depth required for large-scale applications across cells(2,3). Here we introduce Smart-seq3, which combines full-length transcriptome coverage with a 5' unique molecular identifier RNA counting strategy that enables in silico reconstruction of thousands of RNA molecules per cell. Of the counted and reconstructed molecules, 60% could be directly assigned to allelic origin and 30-50% to specific isoforms, and we identified substantial differences in isoform usage in different mouse strains and human cell types. Smart-seq3 greatly increased sensitivity compared to Smart-seq2, typically detecting thousands more transcripts per cell. We expect that Smart-seq3 will enable large-scale characterization of cell types and states across tissues and organisms.
38487851	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	scGIR: deciphering cellular heterogeneity via gene ranking in single-cell weighted gene correlation networks.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating cellular heterogeneity through high-throughput analysis of individual cells. Nevertheless, challenges arise from prevalent sequencing dropout events and noise effects, impacting subsequent analyses. Here, we introduce a novel algorithm, Single-cell Gene Importance Ranking (scGIR), which utilizes a single-cell gene correlation network to evaluate gene importance. The algorithm transforms single-cell sequencing data into a robust gene correlation network through statistical independence, with correlation edges weighted by gene expression levels. We then constructed a random walk model on the resulting weighted gene correlation network to rank the importance of genes. Our analysis of gene importance using PageRank algorithm across nine authentic scRNA-seq datasets indicates that scGIR can effectively surmount technical noise, enabling the identification of cell types and inference of developmental trajectories. We demonstrated that the edges of gene correlation, weighted by expression, play a critical role in enhancing the algorithm's performance. Our findings emphasize that scGIR outperforms in enhancing the clustering of cell subtypes, reverse identifying differentially expressed marker genes, and uncovering genes with potential differential importance. Overall, we proposed a promising method capable of extracting more information from single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, potentially shedding new lights on cellular processes and disease mechanisms.
40442373	2025	Nature methods	A visual-omics foundation model to bridge histopathology with spatial transcriptomics.	Artificial intelligence has revolutionized computational biology. Recent developments in omics technologies, including single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, provide detailed genomic data alongside tissue histology. However, current computational models focus on either omics or image analysis, lacking their integration. To address this, we developed OmiCLIP, a visual-omics foundation model linking hematoxylin and eosin images and transcriptomics using tissue patches from Visium data. We transformed transcriptomic data into 'sentences' by concatenating top-expressed gene symbols from each patch. We curated a dataset of 2.2 million paired tissue images and transcriptomic data across 32 organs to train OmiCLIP integrating histology and transcriptomics. Building on OmiCLIP, our Loki platform offers five key functions: tissue alignment, annotation via bulk RNA sequencing or marker genes, cell-type decomposition, image-transcriptomics retrieval and spatial transcriptomics gene expression prediction from hematoxylin and eosin-stained images. Compared with 22 state-of-the-art models on 5 simulations, and 19 public and 4 in-house experimental datasets, Loki demonstrated consistent accuracy and robustness.
41267095	2025	Genome biology	Benchmarking deep learning methods for biologically conserved single-cell integration.	BACKGROUND: Advancements in single-cell RNA sequencing have enabled the analysis of millions of cells, but integrating such data across samples and methods while mitigating batch effects remains challenging. Deep learning approaches address this by learning biologically conserved gene expression representations, yet systematic benchmarking of loss functions and integration performance is lacking. RESULTS: We evaluate 16 integration methods using a unified variational autoencoder framework, incorporating batch and cell-type information. Results reveal limitations in the single-cell integration benchmarking index (scIB) for preserving intra-cell-type information. To address this, we introduce a correlation-based loss function and enhance benchmarking metrics to better capture biological conservation. Using cell annotations from lung and breast atlases, our approach improves biological signal preservation. We propose a refined integration framework, scIB-E, and metrics that provide deeper insights into the integration process and offer guidance for advanced developments in integrating increasingly complex single-cell data. CONCLUSIONS: This benchmark highlights the potential of deep learning-based approaches for single-cell data integration, emphasizing the importance of biologically informed metrics and improved benchmarking strategies.
36653899	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Context-dependent gene regulatory network reveals regulation dynamics and cell trajectories using unspliced transcripts.	Gene regulatory networks govern complex gene expression programs in various biological phenomena, including embryonic development, cell fate decisions and oncogenesis. Single-cell techniques are increasingly being used to study gene expression, providing higher resolution than traditional approaches. However, inferring a comprehensive gene regulatory network across different cell types remains a challenge. Here, we propose to construct context-dependent gene regulatory networks (CDGRNs) from single-cell RNA sequencing data utilizing both spliced and unspliced transcript expression levels. A gene regulatory network is decomposed into subnetworks corresponding to different transcriptomic contexts. Each subnetwork comprises the consensus active regulation pairs of transcription factors and their target genes shared by a group of cells, inferred by a Gaussian mixture model. We find that the union of gene regulation pairs in all contexts is sufficient to reconstruct differentiation trajectories. Functions specific to the cell cycle, cell differentiation or tissue-specific functions are enriched throughout the developmental process in each context. Surprisingly, we also observe that the network entropy of CDGRNs decreases along differentiation trajectories, indicating directionality in differentiation. Overall, CDGRN allows us to establish the connection between gene regulation at the molecular level and cell differentiation at the macroscopic level.
38444088	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Incorporating temporal information during feature engineering bolsters emulation of spatio-temporal emergence.	MOTIVATION: Emergent biological dynamics derive from the evolution of lower-level spatial and temporal processes. A long-standing challenge for scientists and engineers is identifying simple low-level rules that give rise to complex higher-level dynamics. High-resolution biological data acquisition enables this identification and has evolved at a rapid pace for both experimental and computational approaches. Simultaneously harnessing the resolution and managing the expense of emerging technologies-e.g. live cell imaging, scRNAseq, agent-based models-requires a deeper understanding of how spatial and temporal axes impact biological systems. Effective emulation is a promising solution to manage the expense of increasingly complex high-resolution computational models. In this research, we focus on the emulation of a tumor microenvironment agent-based model to examine the relationship between spatial and temporal environment features, and emergent tumor properties. RESULTS: Despite significant feature engineering, we find limited predictive capacity of tumor properties from initial system representations. However, incorporating temporal information derived from intermediate simulation states dramatically improves the predictive performance of machine learning models. We train a deep-learning emulator on intermediate simulation states and observe promising enhancements over emulators trained solely on initial conditions. Our results underscore the importance of incorporating temporal information in the evaluation of spatio-temporal emergent behavior. Nevertheless, the emulators exhibit inconsistent performance, suggesting that the underlying model characterizes unique cell populations dynamics that are not easily replaced. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: All source codes for the agent-based model, emulation, and analyses are publicly available at the corresponding DOIs: 10.5281/zenodo.10622155, 10.5281/zenodo.10611675, 10.5281/zenodo.10621244, respectively.
31693086	2019	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Improved dropClust R package with integrative analysis support for scRNA-seq data.

41084016	2025	Genome biology	Spatial and single-cell expression analyses reveal complex expression domains in early wheat spike development.	BACKGROUND: Wheat is important for global food security. Understanding the molecular mechanisms driving spike and spikelet development can benefit the development of more productive varieties. RESULTS: Here we integrate single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to generate an atlas of cell clusters and expression domains during the early stages of wheat spike development. We characterize spatiotemporal expression of 99 genes by smFISH in 48,225 cells at early transition (W1.5), late double ridge (W2.5), and floret primordia stages (W3.5). These cells are grouped into 21 different expression domains, including four in the basal region of the developing spikelets and three different meristematic regions, which are consistent across spikelets and sections. Using induced mutants, we reveal functional roles associated with the specific expression patterns of LFY in intercalary meristems, SPL14 in inflorescence meristems, and FZP in glume axillae. Complementary scRNA-seq profiling of 26,009 cells from W2.5 and W3.5 stages identifies 23 distinct cell clusters. We use the scRNA-seq information to impute the expression of 74,464 genes into the spatially anchored smFISH-labelled cells and generate a public website to visualize them. We then use experimental and imputed expression profiles, together with co-expression studies and correlation matrices, to annotate the scRNA-seq clusters. From co-expression analyses, we identify genes associated with boundary genes TCP24 and FZP, as well as the meristematic genes AGL6 and ULT1. CONCLUSIONS: The smFISH and scRNA-seq studies provide complementary tools for dissecting gene networks that regulate spike development and identifying new co-expressed genes for functional characterization.
39851075	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Complex hierarchical structures analysis in single-cell data with Poincare deep manifold transformation.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers remarkable insights into cellular development and differentiation by capturing the gene expression profiles of individual cells. The role of dimensionality reduction and visualization in the interpretation of scRNA-seq data has gained widely acceptance. However, current methods face several challenges, including incomplete structure-preserving strategies and high distortion in embeddings, which fail to effectively model complex cell trajectories with multiple branches. To address these issues, we propose the Poincare deep manifold transformation (PoincareDMT) method, which maps high-dimensional scRNA-seq data to a hyperbolic Poincare disk. This approach preserves global structure from a graph Laplacian matrix while achieving local structure correction through a structure module combined with data augmentation. Additionally, PoincareDMT alleviates batch effects by integrating a batch graph that accounts for batch labels into the low-dimensional embeddings during network training. Furthermore, PoincareDMT introduces the Shapley additive explanations method based on trained model to identify the important marker genes in specific clusters and cell differentiation process. Therefore, PoincareDMT provides a unified framework for multiple key tasks essential for scRNA-seq analysis, including trajectory inference, pseudotime inference, batch correction, and marker gene selection. We validate PoincareDMT through extensive evaluations on both simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets, demonstrating its superior performance in preserving global and local data structures compared to existing methods.
40052442	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Unveiling a novel cancer hallmark by evaluation of neural infiltration in cancer.	Cancer cells acquire necessary functional capabilities for malignancy through the influence of the nervous system. We evaluate the extent of neural infiltration within the tumor microenvironment (TME) across multiple cancer types, highlighting its role as a cancer hallmark. We identify cancer-related neural genes using 40 bulk RNA-seq datasets across 10 cancer types, developing a predictive score for cancer-related neural infiltration (C-Neural score). Cancer samples with elevated C-Neural scores exhibit perineural invasion, recurrence, metastasis, higher stage or grade, or poor prognosis. Epithelial cells show the highest C-Neural scores among all cell types in 55 single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. The epithelial cells with high C-Neural scores (epi-highCNs) characterized by increased copy number variation, reduced cell differentiation, higher epithelial-mesenchymal transition scores, and elevated metabolic level. Epi-highCNs frequently communicate with Schwann cells by FN1 signaling pathway. The co-culture experiment indicates that Schwann cells may facilitate cancer progression through upregulation of VDAC1. Moreover, C-Neural scores positively correlate with the infiltration of antitumor immune cells, indicating potential response for immunotherapy. Melanoma patients with high C-Neural scores may benefit from trametinib. These analyses illuminate the extent of neural influence within TME, suggesting potential role as a cancer hallmark and offering implications for effective therapeutic strategies against cancer.
40813249	2025	Genome research	Multicondition and multimodal temporal profile inference during mouse embryonic development.	The emergence of single-cell time-series data sets enables modeling of changes in various types of cellular profiles over time. However, because of the disruptive nature of single-cell measurements, it is impossible to capture the full temporal trajectory of a particular cell. Furthermore, single-cell profiles can be collected at mismatched time points across different conditions (e.g., sex, batch, disease) and data modalities (e.g., scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq), which makes modeling challenging. Here, we propose a joint modeling framework, Sunbear, for integrating multicondition and multimodal single-cell profiles across time. Sunbear can be used to impute single-cell temporal profile changes, align multi-data set and multimodal profiles across time, and extrapolate single-cell profiles in a missing modality. We apply Sunbear to reveal sex-biased transcription during mouse embryonic development and predict dynamic relationships between epigenetic priming and transcription for cells in which multimodal profiles are unavailable. Sunbear thus enables the projection of single-cell time-series snapshots to multimodal and multicondition views of cellular trajectories.
33834202	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	WEDGE: imputation of gene expression values from single-cell RNA-seq datasets using biased matrix decomposition.	The low capture rate of expressed RNAs from single-cell sequencing technology is one of the major obstacles to downstream functional genomics analyses. Recently, a number of imputation methods have emerged for single-cell transcriptome data, however, recovering missing values in very sparse expression matrices remains a substantial challenge. Here, we propose a new algorithm, WEDGE (WEighted Decomposition of Gene Expression), to impute gene expression matrices by using a biased low-rank matrix decomposition method. WEDGE successfully recovered expression matrices, reproduced the cell-wise and gene-wise correlations and improved the clustering of cells, performing impressively for applications with sparse datasets. Overall, this study shows a potent approach for imputing sparse expression matrix data, and our WEDGE algorithm should help many researchers to more profitably explore the biological meanings embedded in their single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. The source code of WEDGE has been released at https://github.com/QuKunLab/WEDGE.
38653489	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Single-cell multi-omics analysis identifies context-specific gene regulatory gates and mechanisms.	There is a growing interest in inferring context specific gene regulatory networks from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. This involves identifying the regulatory relationships between transcription factors (TFs) and genes in individual cells, and then characterizing these relationships at the level of specific cell types or cell states. In this study, we introduce scGATE (single-cell gene regulatory gate) as a novel computational tool for inferring TF-gene interaction networks and reconstructing Boolean logic gates involving regulatory TFs using scRNA-seq data. In contrast to current Boolean models, scGATE eliminates the need for individual formulations and likelihood calculations for each Boolean rule (e.g. AND, OR, XOR). By employing a Bayesian framework, scGATE infers the Boolean rule after fitting the model to the data, resulting in significant reductions in time-complexities for logic-based studies. We have applied assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (scATAC-seq) data and TF DNA binding motifs to filter out non-relevant TFs in gene regulations. By integrating single-cell clustering with these external cues, scGATE is able to infer context specific networks. The performance of scGATE is evaluated using synthetic and real single-cell multi-omics data from mouse tissues and human blood, demonstrating its superiority over existing tools for reconstructing TF-gene networks. Additionally, scGATE provides a flexible framework for understanding the complex combinatorial and cooperative relationships among TFs regulating target genes by inferring Boolean logic gates among them.
40905625	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scnanoseq: an nf-core pipeline for Oxford Nanopore single-cell RNA-sequencing.	MOTIVATION: Recent advancements in long-read single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have facilitated the quantification of full-length transcripts and isoforms at the single-cell level. Historically, long-read data would need to be complemented with short-read single-cell data in order to overcome the higher sequencing errors to correctly identify cellular barcodes and unique molecular identifiers. Improvements in Oxford Nanopore sequencing, and development of novel computational methods have removed this requirement. Though these methods now exist, the limited availability of modular and portable workflows remains a challenge. RESULTS: Here, we present, nf-core/scnanoseq, a secondary analysis pipeline for long-read single-cell and single-nuclei RNA that delivers gene and transcript-level quantification. The scnanoseq pipeline is implemented using Nextflow and is built upon the nf-core framework, enabling portability across computational environments, scalability and reproducibility of results across pipeline runs. The nf-core/scnanoseq workflow follows best practices for analyzing single-cell and single-nuclei data, performing barcode detection and correction, genome and transcriptome read alignment, unique molecular identifier deduplication, gene and transcript quantification, and extensive quality control reporting. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code, and detailed documentation are freely available at https://github.com/nf-core/scnanoseq and https://nf-co.re/scnanoseq under the MIT License. Documentation for the version of nf-core/scnanoseq used for this paper, including default parameters and descriptions of output files are available at https://nf-co.re/scnanoseq/1.1.0.
40086881	2025	Genome research	Accurate fusion transcript identification from long- and short-read isoform sequencing at bulk or single-cell resolution.	Gene fusions are found as cancer drivers in diverse adult and pediatric cancers. Accurate detection of fusion transcripts is essential in cancer clinical diagnostics and prognostics and for guiding therapeutic development. Most currently available methods for fusion transcript detection are compatible with Illumina RNA-seq involving highly accurate short-read sequences. Recent advances in long-read isoform sequencing enable the detection of fusion transcripts at unprecedented resolution in bulk and single-cell samples. Here, we developed a new computational tool, CTAT-LR-Fusion, to detect fusion transcripts from long-read RNA-seq with or without companion short reads, with applications to bulk or single-cell transcriptomes. We demonstrate that CTAT-LR-Fusion exceeds the fusion detection accuracy of alternative methods as benchmarked with simulated and genuine long-read RNA-seq. Using short- and long-read RNA-seq, we further apply CTAT-LR-Fusion to bulk transcriptomes of nine tumor cell lines and to tumor single cells derived from a melanoma sample and three metastatic high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma samples. In both bulk and single-cell RNA-seq, long isoform reads yield higher sensitivity for fusion detection than short reads with notable exceptions. By combining short and long reads in CTAT-LR-Fusion, we are able to further maximize the detection of fusion splicing isoforms and fusion-expressing tumor cells.
30404663	2018	Genome biology	Simulation-based benchmarking of isoform quantification in single-cell RNA-seq.	Single-cell RNA-seq has the potential to facilitate isoform quantification as the confounding factor of a mixed population of cells is eliminated. However, best practice for using existing quantification methods has not been established. We carry out a benchmark for five popular isoform quantification tools. Performance is generally good for simulated data based on SMARTer and SMART-seq2 data. The reduction in performance compared with bulk RNA-seq is small. An important biological insight comes from our analysis of real data which shows that genes that express two isoforms in bulk RNA-seq predominantly express one or neither isoform in individual cells.
39700255	2024	PLoS computational biology	Predicting lung aging using scRNA-Seq data.	Age prediction based on single cell RNA-Sequencing data (scRNA-Seq) can provide information for patients' susceptibility to various diseases and conditions. In addition, such analysis can be used to identify aging related genes and pathways. To enable age prediction based on scRNA-Seq data, we developed PolyEN, a new regression model which learns continuous representation for expression over time. These representations are then used by PolyEN to integrate genes to predict an age. Existing and new lung aging data we profiled demonstrated PolyEN's improved performance over existing methods for age prediction. Our results identified lung epithelial cells as the most significant predictors for non-smokers while lung endothelial cells led to the best chronological age prediction results for smokers.
33741686	2021	Genome research	Alignment of single-cell RNA-seq samples without overcorrection using kernel density matching.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology is poised to replace bulk cell RNA sequencing for many biological and medical applications as it allows users to measure gene expression levels in a cell type-specific manner. However, data produced by scRNA-seq often exhibit batch effects that can be specific to a cell type, to a sample, or to an experiment, which prevent integration or comparisons across multiple experiments. Here, we present Dmatch, a method that leverages an external expression atlas of human primary cells and kernel density matching to align multiple scRNA-seq experiments for downstream biological analysis. Dmatch facilitates alignment of scRNA-seq data sets with cell types that may overlap only partially and thus allows integration of multiple distinct scRNA-seq experiments to extract biological insights. In simulation, Dmatch compares favorably to other alignment methods, both in terms of reducing sample-specific clustering and in terms of avoiding overcorrection. When applied to scRNA-seq data collected from clinical samples in a healthy individual and five autoimmune disease patients, Dmatch enabled cell type-specific differential gene expression comparisons across biopsy sites and disease conditions and uncovered a shared population of pro-inflammatory monocytes across biopsy sites in RA patients. We further show that Dmatch increases the number of eQTLs mapped from population scRNA-seq data. Dmatch is fast, scalable, and improves the utility of scRNA-seq for several important applications. Dmatch is freely available online.
34849562	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	Deep learning-based advances and applications for single-cell RNA-sequencing data analysis.	The rapid development of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has raised significant computational and analytical challenges. The application of deep learning to scRNA-seq data analysis is rapidly evolving and can overcome the unique challenges in upstream (quality control and normalization) and downstream (cell-, gene- and pathway-level) analysis of scRNA-seq data. In the present study, recent advances and applications of deep learning-based methods, together with specific tools for scRNA-seq data analysis, were summarized. Moreover, the future perspectives and challenges of deep-learning techniques regarding the appropriate analysis and interpretation of scRNA-seq data were investigated. The present study aimed to provide evidence supporting the biomedical application of deep learning-based tools and may aid biologists and bioinformaticians in navigating this exciting and fast-moving area.
41183107	2025	PLoS computational biology	Branch-specific gene discovery in cell differentiation using multi-omics graph attention.	Understanding gene regulation during cell differentiation requires effective integration of multi-omics single-cell data. In this study, we propose BranchKGN, a heterogeneous graph transformer-based framework for identifying branch-specific key genes along cell differentiation trajectories. By integrating scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data into a unified gene representation, we infer differentiation trajectories using Slingshot and construct a heterogeneous graph capturing gene-cell relationships. Through attention-based graph learning, BranchKGN assigns gene importance scores within each cell, enabling the identification of genes consistently informative across branch point cells and their descendant lineages. These genes are then used to reconstruct gene regulatory networks and differentiation trajectories. Validation on three independent datasets demonstrates that the identified gene sets not only capture key regulators of cell fate bifurcation but also support accurate reconstruction of differentiation trajectories. Our results highlight the effectiveness of BranchKGN in dissecting gene regulation dynamics during cellular transitions and provide a valuable tool for multi-omics single-cell analysis.
39171840	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scDiffusion: conditional generation of high-quality single-cell data using diffusion model.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data are important for studying the laws of life at single-cell level. However, it is still challenging to obtain enough high-quality scRNA-seq data. To mitigate the limited availability of data, generative models have been proposed to computationally generate synthetic scRNA-seq data. Nevertheless, the data generated with current models are not very realistic yet, especially when we need to generate data with controlled conditions. In the meantime, diffusion models have shown their power in generating data with high fidelity, providing a new opportunity for scRNA-seq generation. RESULTS: In this study, we developed scDiffusion, a generative model combining the diffusion model and foundation model to generate high-quality scRNA-seq data with controlled conditions. We designed multiple classifiers to guide the diffusion process simultaneously, enabling scDiffusion to generate data under multiple condition combinations. We also proposed a new control strategy called Gradient Interpolation. This strategy allows the model to generate continuous trajectories of cell development from a given cell state. Experiments showed that scDiffusion could generate single-cell gene expression data closely resembling real scRNA-seq data. Also, scDiffusion can conditionally produce data on specific cell types including rare cell types. Furthermore, we could use the multiple-condition generation of scDiffusion to generate cell type that was out of the training data. Leveraging the Gradient Interpolation strategy, we generated a continuous developmental trajectory of mouse embryonic cells. These experiments demonstrate that scDiffusion is a powerful tool for augmenting the real scRNA-seq data and can provide insights into cell fate research. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: scDiffusion is openly available at the GitHub repository https://github.com/EperLuo/scDiffusion or Zenodo https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.13268742.
34579774	2021	Genome biology	Single-cell landscape of nuclear configuration and gene expression during stem cell differentiation and X inactivation.	"BACKGROUND: Mammalian development is associated with extensive changes in gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and nuclear structure. Here, we follow such changes associated with mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation and X inactivation by integrating, for the first time, allele-specific data from these three modalities obtained by high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and Hi-C. RESULTS: Allele-specific contact decay profiles obtained by single-cell Hi-C clearly show that the inactive X chromosome has a unique profile in differentiated cells that have undergone X inactivation. Loss of this inactive X-specific structure at mitosis is followed by its reappearance during the cell cycle, suggesting a ""bookmark"" mechanism. Differentiation of embryonic stem cells to follow the onset of X inactivation is associated with changes in contact decay profiles that occur in parallel on both the X chromosomes and autosomes. Single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq show evidence of a delay in female versus male cells, due to the presence of two active X chromosomes at early stages of differentiation. The onset of the inactive X-specific structure in single cells occurs later than gene silencing, consistent with the idea that chromatin compaction is a late event of X inactivation. Single-cell Hi-C highlights evidence of discrete changes in nuclear structure characterized by the acquisition of very long-range contacts throughout the nucleus. Novel computational approaches allow for the effective alignment of single-cell gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and 3D chromosome structure. CONCLUSIONS: Based on trajectory analyses, three distinct nuclear structure states are detected reflecting discrete and profound simultaneous changes not only to the structure of the X chromosomes, but also to that of autosomes during differentiation. Our study reveals that long-range structural changes to chromosomes appear as discrete events, unlike progressive changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility."
38701411	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	AI identifies potent inducers of breast cancer stem cell differentiation based on adversarial learning from gene expression data.	Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a subpopulation of cancer cells within tumors that exhibit stem-like properties and represent a potentially effective therapeutic target toward long-term remission by means of differentiation induction. By leveraging an artificial intelligence approach solely based on transcriptomics data, this study scored a large library of small molecules based on their predicted ability to induce differentiation in stem-like cells. In particular, a deep neural network model was trained using publicly available single-cell RNA-Seq data obtained from untreated human-induced pluripotent stem cells at various differentiation stages and subsequently utilized to screen drug-induced gene expression profiles from the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) database. The challenge of adapting such different data domains was tackled by devising an adversarial learning approach that was able to effectively identify and remove domain-specific bias during the training phase. Experimental validation in MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 cells demonstrated the efficacy of five out of six tested molecules among those scored highest by the model. In particular, the efficacy of triptolide, OTS-167, quinacrine, granisetron and A-443654 offer a potential avenue for targeted therapies against breast CSCs.
40662821	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Prediction of gene regulatory connections with joint single-cell foundation models and graph-based learning.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data offers unprecedented opportunities to infer gene regulatory networks (GRNs) at a fine-grained resolution, shedding light on cellular phenotypes at the molecular level. However, the high sparsity, noise, and dropout events inherent in scRNA-seq data pose significant challenges for accurate and reliable GRN inference. The rapid growth in experimentally validated transcription factor-DNA binding data has enabled supervised machine learning methods, which rely on known regulatory interactions to learn patterns, and achieve high accuracy in GRN inference by framing it as a gene regulatory link prediction task. This study addresses the gene regulatory link prediction problem by learning vectorized representations at the gene level to predict missing regulatory interactions. However, a higher performance of supervised learning methods requires a large amount of known TF-DNA binding data, which is often experimentally expensive and therefore limited in amount. Advances in large-scale pre-training and transfer learning provide a transformative opportunity to address this challenge. In this study, we leverage large-scale pre-trained models, trained on extensive scRNA-seq datasets and known as single-cell foundation models (scFMs). These models are combined with joint graph-based learning to establish a robust foundation for gene regulatory link prediction. RESULTS: We propose scRegNet, a novel and effective framework that leverages scFMs with joint graph-based learning for gene regulatory link prediction. scRegNet achieves state-of-the-art results in comparison with nine baseline methods on seven scRNA-seq benchmark datasets. Additionally, scRegNet is more robust than the baseline methods on noisy training data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code is available at https://github.com/sindhura-cs/scRegNet.
39226185	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	SCIntRuler: guiding the integration of multiple single-cell RNA-seq datasets with a novel statistical metric.	MOTIVATION: The growing number of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) studies highlights the potential benefits of integrating multiple datasets, such as augmenting sample sizes and enhancing analytical robustness. Inherent diversity and batch discrepancies within samples or across studies continue to pose significant challenges for computational analyses. Questions persist in practice, lacking definitive answers: Should we use a specific integration method or opt for simply merging the datasets during joint analysis? Among all the existing data integration methods, which one is more suitable in specific scenarios? RESULT: To fill the gap, we introduce SCIntRuler, a novel statistical metric for guiding the integration of multiple scRNA-seq datasets. SCIntRuler helps researchers make informed decisions regarding the necessity of data integration and the selection of an appropriate integration method. Our simulations and real data applications demonstrate that SCIntRuler streamlines decision-making processes and facilitates the analysis of diverse scRNA-seq datasets under varying contexts, thereby alleviating the complexities associated with the integration of heterogeneous scRNA-seq datasets. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The implementation of our method is available on CRAN as an open-source R package with a user-friendly manual available: https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/SCIntRuler/index.html.
35598334	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	Identifying the critical states of complex diseases by the dynamic change of multivariate distribution.	The dynamics of complex diseases are not always smooth; they are occasionally abrupt, i.e. there is a critical state transition or tipping point at which the disease undergoes a sudden qualitative shift. There are generally a few significant differences in the critical state in terms of gene expressions or other static measurements, which may lead to the failure of traditional differential expression-based biomarkers to identify such a tipping point. In this study, we propose a computational method, the direct interaction network-based divergence, to detect the critical state of complex diseases by exploiting the dynamic changes in multivariable distributions inferred from observable samples and local biomolecular direct interaction networks. Such a method is model-free and applicable to both bulk and single-cell expression data. Our approach was validated by successfully identifying the tipping point just before the occurrence of a critical transition for both a simulated data set and seven real data sets, including those from The Cancer Genome Atlas and two single-cell RNA-sequencing data sets of cell differentiation. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses also validated the computational results from the perspectives of both molecules and networks.
31028376	2019	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scMatch: a single-cell gene expression profile annotation tool using reference datasets.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) measures gene expression at the resolution of individual cells. Massively multiplexed single-cell profiling has enabled large-scale transcriptional analyses of thousands of cells in complex tissues. In most cases, the true identity of individual cells is unknown and needs to be inferred from the transcriptomic data. Existing methods typically cluster (group) cells based on similarities of their gene expression profiles and assign the same identity to all cells within each cluster using the averaged expression levels. However, scRNA-seq experiments typically produce low-coverage sequencing data for each cell, which hinders the clustering process. RESULTS: We introduce scMatch, which directly annotates single cells by identifying their closest match in large reference datasets. We used this strategy to annotate various single-cell datasets and evaluated the impacts of sequencing depth, similarity metric and reference datasets. We found that scMatch can rapidly and robustly annotate single cells with comparable accuracy to another recent cell annotation tool (SingleR), but that it is quicker and can handle larger reference datasets. We demonstrate how scMatch can handle large customized reference gene expression profiles that combine data from multiple sources, thus empowering researchers to identify cell populations in any complex tissue with the desired precision. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: scMatch (Python code) and the FANTOM5 reference dataset are freely available to the research community here https://github.com/forrest-lab/scMatch. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
38632952	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Topological and geometric analysis of cell states in single-cell transcriptomic data.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables dissecting cellular heterogeneity in tissues, resulting in numerous biological discoveries. Various computational methods have been devised to delineate cell types by clustering scRNA-seq data, where clusters are often annotated using prior knowledge of marker genes. In addition to identifying pure cell types, several methods have been developed to identify cells undergoing state transitions, which often rely on prior clustering results. The present computational approaches predominantly investigate the local and first-order structures of scRNA-seq data using graph representations, while scRNA-seq data frequently display complex high-dimensional structures. Here, we introduce scGeom, a tool that exploits the multiscale and multidimensional structures in scRNA-seq data by analyzing the geometry and topology through curvature and persistent homology of both cell and gene networks. We demonstrate the utility of these structural features to reflect biological properties and functions in several applications, where we show that curvatures and topological signatures of cell and gene networks can help indicate transition cells and the differentiation potential of cells. We also illustrate that structural characteristics can improve the classification of cell types.
39556617	2024	PLoS computational biology	Storm: Incorporating transient stochastic dynamics to infer the RNA velocity with metabolic labeling information.	The time-resolved scRNA-seq (tscRNA-seq) provides the possibility to infer physically meaningful kinetic parameters, e.g., the transcription, splicing or RNA degradation rate constants with correct magnitudes, and RNA velocities by incorporating temporal information. Previous approaches utilizing the deterministic dynamics and steady-state assumption on gene expression states are insufficient to achieve favorable results for the data involving transient process. We present a dynamical approach, Storm (Stochastic models of RNA metabolic-labeling), to overcome these limitations by solving stochastic differential equations of gene expression dynamics. The derivation reveals that the new mRNA sequencing data obeys different types of cell-specific Poisson distributions when jointly considering both biological and cell-specific technical noise. Storm deals with measured counts data directly and extends the RNA velocity methodology based on metabolic labeling scRNA-seq data to transient stochastic systems. Furthermore, we relax the constant parameter assumption over genes/cells to obtain gene-cell-specific transcription/splicing rates and gene-specific degradation rates, thus revealing time-dependent and cell-state-specific transcriptional regulations. Storm will facilitate the study of the statistical properties of tscRNA-seq data, eventually advancing our understanding of the dynamic transcription regulation during development and disease.
36038632	2023	Nature biotechnology	Human ureteric bud organoids recapitulate branching morphogenesis and differentiate into functional collecting duct cell types.	Directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into functional ureteric and collecting duct (CD) epithelia is essential to kidney regenerative medicine. Here we describe highly efficient, serum-free differentiation of hPSCs into ureteric bud (UB) organoids and functional CD cells. The hPSCs are first induced into pronephric progenitor cells at 90% efficiency and then aggregated into spheres with a molecular signature similar to the nephric duct. In a three-dimensional matrix, the spheres form UB organoids that exhibit branching morphogenesis similar to the fetal UB and correct distal tip localization of RET expression. Organoid-derived cells incorporate into the UB tips of the progenitor niche in chimeric fetal kidney explant culture. At later stages, the UB organoids differentiate into CD organoids, which contain >95% CD cell types as estimated by single-cell RNA sequencing. The CD epithelia demonstrate renal electrophysiologic functions, with ENaC-mediated vectorial sodium transport by principal cells and V-type ATPase proton pump activity by FOXI1-induced intercalated cells.
39565208	2025	Nucleic acids research	sc2GWAS: a comprehensive platform linking single cell and GWAS traits of human.	Identifying cell populations associated with risk variants is essential for uncovering cell-specific mechanisms that drive disease development and progression. Integrating genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become an effective strategy for detecting trait-cell relationships. The accumulation of trait-related single cell data has led to an urgent need for its comprehensively processing. To address this, we developed sc2GWAS (https://bio.liclab.net/sc2GWAS/), which aims to document large-scale GWAS trait-cell regulatory pairs at single-cell resolution and provide comprehensive annotations and enrichment analyses for these related pairs. The current version of sc2GWAS curates a total of 15 078 310 candidate trait-cell pairs from > 6 300 000 individual cells, offering a valuable resource for exploring complex regulatory relationships between traits and cells. We applied strict quality control measures on both scRNA-seq data and GWAS data, ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the datasets for the identification of trait-relevant cells and genes. In addition, sc2GWAS provides ranked lists of trait-relevant genes and extensive (epi) genetic annotations, making it a valuable resource for downstream analyses. We demonstrate the utility of the platform by investigating Alzheimer's disease, where we identified significant associations between the disease and microglial cells, with the APOE gene emerging as particularly significant. This platform facilitates detailed research into complex trait-cell and trait-gene interactions, we anticipate that sc2GWAS will become a comprehensive and valuable platform for exploring GWAS trait-cell regulatory mechanisms.
31823809	2019	Genome biology	Accuracy, robustness and scalability of dimensionality reduction methods for single-cell RNA-seq analysis.	BACKGROUND: Dimensionality reduction is an indispensable analytic component for many areas of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis. Proper dimensionality reduction can allow for effective noise removal and facilitate many downstream analyses that include cell clustering and lineage reconstruction. Unfortunately, despite the critical importance of dimensionality reduction in scRNA-seq analysis and the vast number of dimensionality reduction methods developed for scRNA-seq studies, few comprehensive comparison studies have been performed to evaluate the effectiveness of different dimensionality reduction methods in scRNA-seq. RESULTS: We aim to fill this critical knowledge gap by providing a comparative evaluation of a variety of commonly used dimensionality reduction methods for scRNA-seq studies. Specifically, we compare 18 different dimensionality reduction methods on 30 publicly available scRNA-seq datasets that cover a range of sequencing techniques and sample sizes. We evaluate the performance of different dimensionality reduction methods for neighborhood preserving in terms of their ability to recover features of the original expression matrix, and for cell clustering and lineage reconstruction in terms of their accuracy and robustness. We also evaluate the computational scalability of different dimensionality reduction methods by recording their computational cost. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the comprehensive evaluation results, we provide important guidelines for choosing dimensionality reduction methods for scRNA-seq data analysis. We also provide all analysis scripts used in the present study at www.xzlab.org/reproduce.html.
34724962	2021	Genome biology	Enhanced chromatin accessibility contributes to X chromosome dosage compensation in mammals.	BACKGROUND: Precise gene dosage of the X chromosomes is critical for normal development and cellular function. In mice, XX female somatic cells show transcriptional X chromosome upregulation of their single active X chromosome, while the other X chromosome is inactive. Moreover, the inactive X chromosome is reactivated during development in the inner cell mass and in germ cells through X chromosome reactivation, which can be studied in vitro by reprogramming of somatic cells to pluripotency. How chromatin processes and gene regulatory networks evolved to regulate X chromosome dosage in the somatic state and during X chromosome reactivation remains unclear. RESULTS: Using genome-wide approaches, allele-specific ATAC-seq and single-cell RNA-seq, in female embryonic fibroblasts and during reprogramming to pluripotency, we show that chromatin accessibility on the upregulated mammalian active X chromosome is increased compared to autosomes. We further show that increased accessibility on the active X chromosome is erased by reprogramming, accompanied by erasure of transcriptional X chromosome upregulation and the loss of increased transcriptional burst frequency. In addition, we characterize gene regulatory networks during reprogramming and X chromosome reactivation, revealing changes in regulatory states. Our data show that ZFP42/REX1, a pluripotency-associated gene that evolved specifically in placental mammals, targets multiple X-linked genes, suggesting an evolutionary link between ZFP42/REX1, X chromosome reactivation, and pluripotency. CONCLUSIONS: Our data reveal the existence of intrinsic compensatory mechanisms that involve modulation of chromatin accessibility to counteract X-to-Autosome gene dosage imbalances caused by evolutionary or in vitro X chromosome loss and X chromosome inactivation in mammalian cells.
34472590	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	A comparison of deep learning-based pre-processing and clustering approaches for single-cell RNA sequencing data.	The emergence of single cell RNA sequencing has facilitated the studied of genomes, transcriptomes and proteomes. As available single-cell RNA-seq datasets are released continuously, one of the major challenges facing traditional RNA analysis tools is the high-dimensional, high-sparsity, high-noise and large-scale characteristics of single-cell RNA-seq data. Deep learning technologies match the characteristics of single-cell RNA-seq data perfectly and offer unprecedented promise. Here, we give a systematic review for most popular single-cell RNA-seq analysis methods and tools based on deep learning models, involving the procedures of data preprocessing (quality control, normalization, data correction, dimensionality reduction and data visualization) and clustering task for downstream analysis. We further evaluate the deep model-based analysis methods of data correction and clustering quantitatively on 11 gold standard datasets. Moreover, we discuss the data preferences of these methods and their limitations, and give some suggestions and guidance for users to select appropriate methods and tools.
35258562	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scGate: marker-based purification of cell types from heterogeneous single-cell RNA-seq datasets.	SUMMARY: A common bioinformatics task in single-cell data analysis is to purify a cell type or cell population of interest from heterogeneous datasets. Here, we present scGate, an algorithm that automatizes marker-based purification of specific cell populations, without requiring training data or reference gene expression profiles. scGate purifies a cell population of interest using a set of markers organized in a hierarchical structure, akin to gating strategies employed in flow cytometry. scGate outperforms state-of-the-art single-cell classifiers and it can be applied to multiple modalities of single-cell data (e.g. RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, CITE-seq). scGate is implemented as an R package and integrated with the Seurat framework, providing an intuitive tool to isolate cell populations of interest from heterogeneous single-cell datasets. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: scGate is available as an R package at https://github.com/carmonalab/scGate (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6202614). Several reproducible workflows describing the main functions and usage of the package on different single-cell modalities, as well as the code to reproduce the benchmark, can be found at https://github.com/carmonalab/scGate.demo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6202585) and https://github.com/carmonalab/scGate.benchmark.

40966644	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Graph-based deep learning for integrating single-cell and bulk transcriptomic data to identify clinical cancer subtypes.	The integration of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and bulk transcriptomic data has become essential for deciphering the complex heterogeneity of cancer and identifying clinical cancer subtypes. However, the inherent challenges posed by the high dimensionality, sparsity, and noise characteristics of scRNA-seq data have significantly hindered its widespread clinical translation. To address these limitations, we introduce single-cell and bulk transcriptomic graph deep learning, a graph-based deep learning method that synergistically integrates scRNA-seq and bulk transcriptomic data to precisely identify cancer subtypes and predict clinical outcomes. scBGDL constructs sample-specific gene graphs modeling complex gene-gene interactions and cellular relationships. The architecture employs Graph Attention Networks for feature aggregation, MinCutPool layers for dimensionality reduction, and Transformer modules to capture high-order biological dependencies. Independently validated in each of 16 distinct The Cancer Genome Atlas cancer types, scBGDL significantly outperformed existing methods in prognostic accuracy (mean C-index: 0.7060 versus 0.6709 max competitor), demonstrating robustness and generalizability to diverse transcriptional architectures. To demonstrate clinical versatility, we further evaluated scBGDL in three therapeutic contexts using multicenter cohorts: lung adenocarcinoma survival prediction (n = 1099), epithelial ovarian cancer platinum-based chemotherapy response (n = 762), skin cutaneous melanoma immunotherapy outcome (n = 305). scBGDL consistently delivered robust risk stratification (log-rank P < 0.05 across cohorts), identified key driver edges, and uncovered clinically relevant biological interpretations. By enabling multimodal data integration and interpretable biological insights, scBGDL advances precision oncology for prognosis prediction, therapy optimization, and biomarker discovery. The source code for scBGDL model is available online (https://github.com/NEFLab/scBGDL).
35870444	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	FitDevo: accurate inference of single-cell developmental potential using sample-specific gene weight.	The quantification of developmental potential is critical for determining developmental stages and identifying essential molecular signatures in single-cell studies. Here, we present FitDevo, a novel method for inferring developmental potential using scRNA-seq data. The main idea of FitDevo is first to generate sample-specific gene weight (SSGW) and then infer developmental potential by calculating the correlation between SSGW and gene expression. SSGW is generated using a generalized linear model that combines sample-specific information and gene weight learned from a training dataset covering scRNA-seq data of 17 previously published datasets. We have rigorously validated FitDevo's effectiveness using a testing dataset with scRNA-seq data from 28 existing datasets and have also demonstrated its superiority over current methods. Furthermore, FitDevo's broad application scope has been illustrated using three practical scenarios: deconvolution analysis of epidermis, spatial transcriptomic data analysis of hearts and intestines, and developmental potential analysis of breast cancer. The source code and related data are available at https://github.com/jumphone/fitdevo.
40581358	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	SeuratIntegrate: an R package to facilitate the use of integration methods with Seurat.	MOTIVATION: Integrating multiple datasets has become an increasingly common task in scRNA-seq analysis. The advent of single-cell atlases adds further complexity, as they often involve combining data with nested batch effects. While common tools such as Seurat offer access to batch-correction methods, the diversity of available options remains limited. With growing evidence that integration method performance varies significantly between datasets, making an informed decision in selecting the most appropriate integration approach is not trivial. A broader range of accessible methods combined with a comprehensive toolbox for comparative integration analysis, would support more effective and flexible single-cell data integration workflows. RESULTS: Built on Seurat's foundations, we developed SeuratIntegrate, an open source R package that expands integration methods available to Seurat users, including Python-based approaches, while operating entirely within the R environment. The package enables integration benchmarking using well-established performance metrics, and provides automated Python environment management, cross-language object conversion, and tools for score handling and visualization. All features are designed for ease of use and extensibility. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code, installation process and vignettes demonstrating usage are freely available on GitHub: https://github.com/cbib/Seurat-Integrate. A Zenodo deposit contains a copy of the package code along with the data to reproduce the results presented above (accession 10.5281/zenodo.14288360). The package is released under the MIT License.
35349708	2022	Nucleic acids research	Joint dimension reduction and clustering analysis of single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data.	Dimension reduction and (spatial) clustering is usually performed sequentially; however, the low-dimensional embeddings estimated in the dimension-reduction step may not be relevant to the class labels inferred in the clustering step. We therefore developed a computation method, Dimension-Reduction Spatial-Clustering (DR-SC), that can simultaneously perform dimension reduction and (spatial) clustering within a unified framework. Joint analysis by DR-SC produces accurate (spatial) clustering results and ensures the effective extraction of biologically informative low-dimensional features. DR-SC is applicable to spatial clustering in spatial transcriptomics that characterizes the spatial organization of the tissue by segregating it into multiple tissue structures. Here, DR-SC relies on a latent hidden Markov random field model to encourage the spatial smoothness of the detected spatial cluster boundaries. Underlying DR-SC is an efficient expectation-maximization algorithm based on an iterative conditional mode. As such, DR-SC is scalable to large sample sizes and can optimize the spatial smoothness parameter in a data-driven manner. With comprehensive simulations and real data applications, we show that DR-SC outperforms existing clustering and spatial clustering methods: it extracts more biologically relevant features than conventional dimension reduction methods, improves clustering performance, and offers improved trajectory inference and visualization for downstream trajectory inference analyses.
32641141	2020	Genome biology	Sierra: discovery of differential transcript usage from polyA-captured single-cell RNA-seq data.	High-throughput single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool for studying gene expression in single cells. Most current scRNA-seq bioinformatics tools focus on analysing overall expression levels, largely ignoring alternative mRNA isoform expression. We present a computational pipeline, Sierra, that readily detects differential transcript usage from data generated by commonly used polyA-captured scRNA-seq technology. We validate Sierra by comparing cardiac scRNA-seq cell types to bulk RNA-seq of matched populations, finding significant overlap in differential transcripts. Sierra detects differential transcript usage across human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the Tabula Muris, and 3 (')UTR shortening in cardiac fibroblasts. Sierra is available at https://github.com/VCCRI/Sierra .
37715282	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Inferring single-cell gene regulatory network by non-redundant mutual information.	Gene regulatory network plays a crucial role in controlling the biological processes of living creatures. Deciphering the complex gene regulatory networks from experimental data remains a major challenge in system biology. Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing technology bring massive high-resolution data, enabling computational inference of cell-specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Many relevant algorithms have been developed to achieve this goal in the past years. However, GRN inference is still less ideal due to the extra noises involved in pseudo-time information and large amounts of dropouts in datasets. Here, we present a novel GRN inference method named Normi, which is based on non-redundant mutual information. Normi manipulates these problems by employing a sliding size-fixed window approach on the entire trajectory and conducts average smoothing strategy on the gene expression of the cells in each window to obtain representative cells. To further alleviate the impact of dropouts, we utilize the mixed KSG estimator to quantify the high-order time-delayed mutual information among genes, then filter out the redundant edges by adopting Max-Relevance and Min Redundancy algorithm. Moreover, we determined the optimal time delay for each gene pair by distance correlation. Normi outperforms other state-of-the-art GRN inference methods on both simulated data and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets, demonstrating its superiority in robustness. The performance of Normi in real scRNA-seq data further reveals its ability to identify the key regulators and crucial biological processes.
32246821	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Joint learning dimension reduction and clustering of single-cell RNA-sequencing data.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) profiles transcriptome of individual cells, which enables the discovery of cell types or subtypes by using unsupervised clustering. Current algorithms perform dimension reduction before cell clustering because of noises, high-dimensionality and linear inseparability of scRNA-seq data. However, independence of dimension reduction and clustering fails to fully characterize patterns in data, resulting in an undesirable performance. RESULTS: In this study, we propose a flexible and accurate algorithm for scRNA-seq data by jointly learning dimension reduction and cell clustering (aka DRjCC), where dimension reduction is performed by projected matrix decomposition and cell type clustering by non-negative matrix factorization. We first formulate joint learning of dimension reduction and cell clustering into a constrained optimization problem and then derive the optimization rules. The advantage of DRjCC is that feature selection in dimension reduction is guided by cell clustering, significantly improving the performance of cell type discovery. Eleven scRNA-seq datasets are adopted to validate the performance of algorithms, where the number of single cells varies from 49 to 68 579 with the number of cell types ranging from 3 to 14. The experimental results demonstrate that DRjCC significantly outperforms 13 state-of-the-art methods in terms of various measurements on cell type clustering (on average 17.44% by improvement). Furthermore, DRjCC is efficient and robust across different scRNA-seq datasets from various tissues. The proposed model and methods provide an effective strategy to analyze scRNA-seq data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The software is coded using matlab, and is free available for academic https://github.com/xkmaxidian/DRjCC. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

34503564	2021	Genome biology	Evaluation of some aspects in supervised cell type identification for single-cell RNA-seq: classifier, feature selection, and reference construction.	BACKGROUND: Cell type identification is one of the most important questions in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis. With the accumulation of public scRNA-seq data, supervised cell type identification methods have gained increasing popularity due to better accuracy, robustness, and computational performance. Despite all the advantages, the performance of the supervised methods relies heavily on several key factors: feature selection, prediction method, and, most importantly, choice of the reference dataset. RESULTS: In this work, we perform extensive real data analyses to systematically evaluate these strategies in supervised cell identification. We first benchmark nine classifiers along with six feature selection strategies and investigate the impact of reference data size and number of cell types in cell type prediction. Next, we focus on how discrepancies between reference and target datasets and how data preprocessing such as imputation and batch effect correction affect prediction performance. We also investigate the strategies of pooling and purifying reference data. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our analysis results, we provide guidelines for using supervised cell typing methods. We suggest combining all individuals from available datasets to construct the reference dataset and use multi-layer perceptron (MLP) as the classifier, along with F-test as the feature selection method. All the code used for our analysis is available on GitHub ( https://github.com/marvinquiet/RefConstruction_supervisedCelltyping ).
38317054	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	CTISL: a dynamic stacking multi-class classification approach for identifying cell types from single-cell RNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: Effective identification of cell types is of critical importance in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis. To date, many supervised machine learning-based predictors have been implemented to identify cell types from scRNA-seq datasets. Despite the technical advances of these state-of-the-art tools, most existing predictors were single classifiers, of which the performances can still be significantly improved. It is therefore highly desirable to employ the ensemble learning strategy to develop more accurate computational models for robust and comprehensive identification of cell types on scRNA-seq datasets. RESULTS: We propose a two-layer stacking model, termed CTISL (Cell Type Identification by Stacking ensemble Learning), which integrates multiple classifiers to identify cell types. In the first layer, given a reference scRNA-seq dataset with known cell types, CTISL dynamically combines multiple cell-type-specific classifiers (i.e. support-vector machine and logistic regression) as the base learners to deliver the outcomes for the input of a meta-classifier in the second layer. We conducted a total of 24 benchmarking experiments on 17 human and mouse scRNA-seq datasets to evaluate and compare the prediction performance of CTISL and other state-of-the-art predictors. The experiment results demonstrate that CTISL achieves superior or competitive performance compared to these state-of-the-art approaches. We anticipate that CTISL can serve as a useful and reliable tool for cost-effective identification of cell types from scRNA-seq datasets.

29378643	2018	Genome biology	A Reproducibility-Based Computational Framework Identifies an Inducible, Enhanced Antiviral State in Dendritic Cells from HIV-1 Elite Controllers.	BACKGROUND: Human immunity relies on the coordinated responses of many cellular subsets and functional states. Inter-individual variations in cellular composition and communication could thus potentially alter host protection. Here, we explore this hypothesis by applying single-cell RNA-sequencing to examine viral responses among the dendritic cells (DCs) of three elite controllers (ECs) of HIV-1 infection. RESULTS: To overcome the potentially confounding effects of donor-to-donor variability, we present a generally applicable computational framework for identifying reproducible patterns in gene expression across donors who share a unifying classification. Applying it, we discover a highly functional antiviral DC state in ECs whose fractional abundance after in vitro exposure to HIV-1 correlates with higher CD4(+) T cell counts and lower HIV-1 viral loads, and that effectively primes polyfunctional T cell responses in vitro. By integrating information from existing genomic databases into our reproducibility-based analysis, we identify and validate select immunomodulators that increase the fractional abundance of this state in primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy individuals in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our results demonstrate how single-cell approaches can reveal previously unappreciated, yet important, immune behaviors and empower rational frameworks for modulating systems-level immune responses that may prove therapeutically and prophylactically useful.
32207533	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Resolving single-cell heterogeneity from hundreds of thousands of cells through sequential hybrid clustering and NMF.	MOTIVATION: The rapid proliferation of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) technologies has spurred the development of diverse computational approaches to detect transcriptionally coherent populations. While the complexity of the algorithms for detecting heterogeneity has increased, most require significant user-tuning, are heavily reliant on dimension reduction techniques and are not scalable to ultra-large datasets. We previously described a multi-step algorithm, Iterative Clustering and Guide-gene Selection (ICGS), which applies intra-gene correlation and hybrid clustering to uniquely resolve novel transcriptionally coherent cell populations from an intuitive graphical user interface. RESULTS: We describe a new iteration of ICGS that outperforms state-of-the-art scRNA-Seq detection workflows when applied to well-established benchmarks. This approach combines multiple complementary subtype detection methods (HOPACH, sparse non-negative matrix factorization, cluster 'fitness', support vector machine) to resolve rare and common cell-states, while minimizing differences due to donor or batch effects. Using data from multiple cell atlases, we show that the PageRank algorithm effectively downsamples ultra-large scRNA-Seq datasets, without losing extremely rare or transcriptionally similar yet distinct cell types and while recovering novel transcriptionally distinct cell populations. We believe this new approach holds tremendous promise in reproducibly resolving hidden cell populations in complex datasets. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: ICGS2 is implemented in Python. The source code and documentation are available at http://altanalyze.org. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
39666603	2024	PLoS computational biology	Hierarchical marker genes selection in scRNA-seq analysis.	When analyzing scRNA-seq data containing heterogeneous cell populations, an important task is to select informative marker genes to distinguish various cell clusters and annotate the clusters with biologically meaningful cell types. In existing analysis methods and pipelines, marker genes are typically identified using a one-vs-all strategy, examining differential expression between one cell cluster versus the combination of all other cell clusters. However, this strategy applied to cell clusters belonging to closely related cell types often generates overlapping marker genes, which capture the common signature of closely related cell clusters but provide limited information for distinguishing them. To address the limitations of the one-vs-all strategy, we propose a hierarchical marker gene selection strategy that groups similar cell clusters and selects marker genes in a hierarchical manner. This strategy is able to improve the accuracy and interpretability of cell type identification in single-cell RNA-seq data.
27663498	2017	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Robust classification of single-cell transcriptome data by nonnegative matrix factorization.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell transcriptome data provide unprecedented resolution to study heterogeneity in cell populations and present a challenge for unsupervised classification. Popular methods, like principal component analysis (PCA), often suffer from the high level of noise in the data. RESULTS: Here we adapt Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to study the problem of identifying subpopulations in single-cell transcriptome data. In contrast to the conventional gene-centered view of NMF, identifying metagenes, we used NMF in a cell-centered direction, identifying cell subtypes ('metacells'). Using three different datasets (based on RT-qPCR and single cell RNA-seq data, respectively), we show that NMF outperforms PCA in identifying subpopulations in an accurate and robust way, without the need for prior feature selection; moreover, NMF successfully recovered the broad classes on a large dataset (thousands of single-cell transcriptomes), as identified by a computationally sophisticated method. NMF allows to identify feature genes in a direct, unbiased manner. We propose novel approaches for determining a biologically meaningful number of subpopulations based on minimizing the ambiguity of classification. In conclusion, our study shows that NMF is a robust, informative and simple method for the unsupervised learning of cell subtypes from single-cell gene expression data.

31428793	2019	Nucleic acids research	Reconstructing complex lineage trees from scRNA-seq data using MERLoT.	Advances in single-cell transcriptomics techniques are revolutionizing studies of cellular differentiation and heterogeneity. It has become possible to track the trajectory of thousands of genes across the cellular lineage trees that represent the temporal emergence of cell types during dynamic processes. However, reconstruction of cellular lineage trees with more than a few cell fates has proved challenging. We present MERLoT (https://github.com/soedinglab/merlot), a flexible and user-friendly tool to reconstruct complex lineage trees from single-cell transcriptomics data. It can impute temporal gene expression profiles along the reconstructed tree. We show MERLoT's capabilities on various real cases and hundreds of simulated datasets.
38349062	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Self-supervised deep learning of gene-gene interactions for improved gene expression recovery.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful tool to gain biological insights at the cellular level. However, due to technical limitations of the existing sequencing technologies, low gene expression values are often omitted, leading to inaccurate gene counts. Existing methods, including advanced deep learning techniques, struggle to reliably impute gene expressions due to a lack of mechanisms that explicitly consider the underlying biological knowledge of the system. In reality, it has long been recognized that gene-gene interactions may serve as reflective indicators of underlying biology processes, presenting discriminative signatures of the cells. A genomic data analysis framework that is capable of leveraging the underlying gene-gene interactions is thus highly desirable and could allow for more reliable identification of distinctive patterns of the genomic data through extraction and integration of intricate biological characteristics of the genomic data. Here we tackle the problem in two steps to exploit the gene-gene interactions of the system. We first reposition the genes into a 2D grid such that their spatial configuration reflects their interactive relationships. To alleviate the need for labeled ground truth gene expression datasets, a self-supervised 2D convolutional neural network is employed to extract the contextual features of the interactions from the spatially configured genes and impute the omitted values. Extensive experiments with both simulated and experimental scRNA-seq datasets are carried out to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed strategy against the existing imputation methods.
36575523	2022	Genome biology	Biology-inspired data-driven quality control for scientific discovery in single-cell transcriptomics.	BACKGROUND: Quality control (QC) of cells, a critical first step in single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis, has largely relied on arbitrarily fixed data-agnostic thresholds applied to QC metrics such as gene complexity and fraction of reads mapping to mitochondrial genes. The few existing data-driven approaches perform QC at the level of samples or studies without accounting for biological variation. RESULTS: We first demonstrate that QC metrics vary with both tissue and cell types across technologies, study conditions, and species. We then propose data-driven QC (ddqc), an unsupervised adaptive QC framework to perform flexible and data-driven QC at the level of cell types while retaining critical biological insights and improved power for downstream analysis. ddqc applies an adaptive threshold based on the median absolute deviation on four QC metrics (gene and UMI complexity, fraction of reads mapping to mitochondrial and ribosomal genes). ddqc retains over a third more cells when compared to conventional data-agnostic QC filters. Finally, we show that ddqc recovers biologically meaningful trends in gradation of gene complexity among cell types that can help answer questions of biological interest such as which cell types express the least and most number of transcripts overall, and ribosomal transcripts specifically. CONCLUSIONS: ddqc retains cell types such as metabolically active parenchymal cells and specialized cells such as neutrophils which are often lost by conventional QC. Taken together, our work proposes a revised paradigm to quality filtering best practices-iterative QC, providing a data-driven QC framework compatible with observed biological diversity.
35639705	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scPreGAN, a deep generative model for predicting the response of single-cell expression to perturbation.	MOTIVATION: Rapid developments of single-cell RNA sequencing technologies allow study of responses to external perturbations at individual cell level. However, in many cases, it is hard to collect the perturbed cells, such as knowing the response of a cell type to the drug before actual medication to a patient. Prediction in silicon could alleviate the problem and save cost. Although several tools have been developed, their prediction accuracy leaves much room for improvement. RESULTS: In this article, we propose scPreGAN (Single-Cell data Prediction base on GAN), a deep generative model for predicting the response of single-cell expression to perturbation. ScPreGAN integrates autoencoder and generative adversarial network, the former is to extract common information of the unperturbed data and the perturbed data, the latter is to predict the perturbed data. Experiments on three real datasets show that scPreGAN outperforms three state-of-the-art methods, which can capture the complicated distribution of cell expression and generate the prediction data with the same expression abundance as the real data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The implementation of scPreGAN is available via https://github.com/JaneJiayiDong/scPreGAN.

37147723	2023	Genome biology	Modeling group heteroscedasticity in single-cell RNA-seq pseudo-bulk data.	Group heteroscedasticity is commonly observed in pseudo-bulk single-cell RNA-seq datasets and its presence can hamper the detection of differentially expressed genes. Since most bulk RNA-seq methods assume equal group variances, we introduce two new approaches that account for heteroscedastic groups, namely voomByGroup and voomWithQualityWeights using a blocked design (voomQWB). Compared to current gold-standard methods that do not account for group heteroscedasticity, we show results from simulations and various experiments that demonstrate the superior performance of voomByGroup and voomQWB in terms of error control and power when group variances in pseudo-bulk single-cell RNA-seq data are unequal.
37953308	2024	Nucleic acids research	StemDriver: a knowledgebase of gene functions for hematopoietic stem cell fate determination.	StemDriver is a comprehensive knowledgebase dedicated to the functional annotation of genes participating in the determination of hematopoietic stem cell fate, available at http://biomedbdc.wchscu.cn/StemDriver/. By utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing data, StemDriver has successfully assembled a comprehensive lineage map of hematopoiesis, capturing the entire continuum from the initial formation of hematopoietic stem cells to the fully developed mature cells. Extensive exploration and characterization were conducted on gene expression features corresponding to each lineage commitment. At the current version, StemDriver integrates data from 42 studies, encompassing a diverse range of 14 tissue types spanning from the embryonic phase to adulthood. In order to ensure uniformity and reliability, all data undergo a standardized pipeline, which includes quality data pre-processing, cell type annotation, differential gene expression analysis, identification of gene categories correlated with differentiation, analysis of highly variable genes along pseudo-time, and exploration of gene expression regulatory networks. In total, StemDriver assessed the function of 23 839 genes for human samples and 29 533 genes for mouse samples. Simultaneously, StemDriver also provided users with reference datasets and models for cell annotation. We believe that StemDriver will offer valuable assistance to research focused on cellular development and hematopoiesis.
31980032	2020	Genome biology	scMAGeCK links genotypes with multiple phenotypes in single-cell CRISPR screens.	We present scMAGeCK, a computational framework to identify genomic elements associated with multiple expression-based phenotypes in CRISPR/Cas9 functional screening that uses single-cell RNA-seq as readout. scMAGeCK outperforms existing methods, identifies genes and enhancers with known and novel functions in cell proliferation, and enables an unbiased construction of genotype-phenotype network. Single-cell CRISPR screening on mouse embryonic stem cells identifies key genes associated with different pluripotency states. Applying scMAGeCK on multiple datasets, we identify key factors that improve the power of single-cell CRISPR screening. Collectively, scMAGeCK is a novel tool to study genotype-phenotype relationships at a single-cell level.
32093753	2020	Genome biology	Linked optical and gene expression profiling of single cells at high-throughput.	Single-cell RNA sequencing has emerged as a powerful tool for characterizing cells, but not all phenotypes of interest can be observed through changes in gene expression. Linking sequencing with optical analysis has provided insight into the molecular basis of cellular function, but current approaches have limited throughput. Here, we present a high-throughput platform for linked optical and gene expression profiling of single cells. We demonstrate accurate fluorescence and gene expression measurements on thousands of cells in a single experiment. We use the platform to characterize DNA and RNA changes through the cell cycle and correlate antibody fluorescence with gene expression. The platform's ability to isolate rare cell subsets and perform multiple measurements, including fluorescence and sequencing-based analysis, holds potential for scalable multi-modal single-cell analysis.
25867922	2015	Nature biotechnology	High-throughput spatial mapping of single-cell RNA-seq data to tissue of origin.	Understanding cell type identity in a multicellular organism requires the integration of gene expression profiles from individual cells with their spatial location in a particular tissue. Current technologies allow whole-transcriptome sequencing of spatially identified cells but lack the throughput needed to characterize complex tissues. Here we present a high-throughput method to identify the spatial origin of cells assayed by single-cell RNA-sequencing within a tissue of interest. Our approach is based on comparing complete, specificity-weighted mRNA profiles of a cell with positional gene expression profiles derived from a gene expression atlas. We show that this method allocates cells to precise locations in the brain of the marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii with a success rate of 81%. Our method is applicable to any system that has a reference gene expression database of sufficiently high resolution.
37845779	2023	Genome biology	Data-driven identification of total RNA expression genes for estimation of RNA abundance in heterogeneous cell types highlighted in brain tissue.	We define and identify a new class of control genes for next-generation sequencing called total RNA expression genes (TREGs), which correlate with total RNA abundance in cell types of different sizes and transcriptional activity. We provide a data-driven method to identify TREGs from single-cell RNA sequencing data, allowing the estimation of total amount of RNA when restricted to quantifying a limited number of genes. We demonstrate our method in postmortem human brain using multiplex single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization and compare candidate TREGs against classic housekeeping genes. We identify AKT3 as a top TREG across five brain regions.
31907445	2020	Nature methods	Benchmarking algorithms for gene regulatory network inference from single-cell transcriptomic data.	We present a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art algorithms for inferring gene regulatory networks from single-cell transcriptional data. As the ground truth for assessing accuracy, we use synthetic networks with predictable trajectories, literature-curated Boolean models and diverse transcriptional regulatory networks. We develop a strategy to simulate single-cell transcriptional data from synthetic and Boolean networks that avoids pitfalls of previously used methods. Furthermore, we collect networks from multiple experimental single-cell RNA-seq datasets. We develop an evaluation framework called BEELINE. We find that the area under the precision-recall curve and early precision of the algorithms are moderate. The methods are better in recovering interactions in synthetic networks than Boolean models. The algorithms with the best early precision values for Boolean models also perform well on experimental datasets. Techniques that do not require pseudotime-ordered cells are generally more accurate. Based on these results, we present recommendations to end users. BEELINE will aid the development of gene regulatory network inference algorithms.
30535000	2019	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Optimal Gene Filtering for Single-Cell data (OGFSC)-a gene filtering algorithm for single-cell RNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell transcriptomic data are commonly accompanied by extremely high technical noise due to the low RNA concentrations from individual cells. Precise identification of differentially expressed genes and cell populations are heavily dependent on the effective reduction of technical noise, e.g. by gene filtering. However, there is still no well-established standard in the current approaches of gene filtering. Investigators usually filter out genes based on single fixed threshold, which commonly leads to both over- and under-stringent errors. RESULTS: In this study, we propose a novel algorithm, termed as Optimal Gene Filtering for Single-Cell data, to construct a thresholding curve based on gene expression levels and the corresponding variances. We validated our method on multiple single-cell RNA-seq datasets, including simulated and published experimental datasets. The results show that the known signal and known noise are reliably discriminated in the simulated datasets. In addition, the results of seven experimental datasets demonstrate that these cells of the same annotated types are more sharply clustered using our method. Interestingly, when we re-analyze the dataset from an aging research recently published in Science, we find a list of regulated genes which is different from that reported in the original study, because of using different filtering methods. However, the knowledge based on our findings better matches the progression of immunosenescence. In summary, we here provide an alternative opportunity to probe into the true level of technical noise in single-cell transcriptomic data.

36754847	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	A cofunctional grouping-based approach for non-redundant feature gene selection in unannotated single-cell RNA-seq analysis.	Feature gene selection has significant impact on the performance of cell clustering in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis. A well-rounded feature selection (FS) method should consider relevance, redundancy and complementarity of the features. Yet most existing FS methods focus on gene relevance to the cell types but neglect redundancy and complementarity, which undermines the cell clustering performance. We develop a novel computational method GeneClust to select feature genes for scRNA-seq cell clustering. GeneClust groups genes based on their expression profiles, then selects genes with the aim of maximizing relevance, minimizing redundancy and preserving complementarity. It can work as a plug-in tool for FS with any existing cell clustering method. Extensive benchmark results demonstrate that GeneClust significantly improve the clustering performance. Moreover, GeneClust can group cofunctional genes in biological process and pathway into clusters, thus providing a means of investigating gene interactions and identifying potential genes relevant to biological characteristics of the dataset. GeneClust is freely available at https://github.com/ToryDeng/scGeneClust.
39074160	2024	PLoS computational biology	A rule-based multiscale model of hepatic stellate cell plasticity: Critical role of the inactivation loop in fibrosis progression.	Hepatic stellate cells (HSC) are the source of extracellular matrix (ECM) whose overproduction leads to fibrosis, a condition that impairs liver functions in chronic liver diseases. Understanding the dynamics of HSCs will provide insights needed to develop new therapeutic approaches. Few models of hepatic fibrosis have been proposed, and none of them include the heterogeneity of HSC phenotypes recently highlighted by single-cell RNA sequencing analyses. Here, we developed rule-based models to study HSC dynamics during fibrosis progression and reversion. We used the Kappa graph rewriting language, for which we used tokens and counters to overcome temporal explosion. HSCs are modeled as agents that present seven physiological cellular states and that interact with (TGFbeta1) molecules which regulate HSC activation and the secretion of type I collagen, the main component of the ECM. Simulation studies revealed the critical role of the HSC inactivation process during fibrosis progression and reversion. While inactivation allows elimination of activated HSCs during reversion steps, reactivation loops of inactivated HSCs (iHSCs) are required to sustain fibrosis. Furthermore, we demonstrated the model's sensitivity to (TGFbeta1) parameters, suggesting its adaptability to a variety of pathophysiological conditions for which levels of (TGFbeta1) production associated with the inflammatory response differ. Using new experimental data from a mouse model of CCl4-induced liver fibrosis, we validated the predicted ECM dynamics. Our model also predicts the accumulation of iHSCs during chronic liver disease. By analyzing RNA sequencing data from patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) associated with liver fibrosis, we confirmed this accumulation, identifying iHSCs as novel markers of fibrosis progression. Overall, our study provides the first model of HSC dynamics in chronic liver disease that can be used to explore the regulatory role of iHSCs in liver homeostasis. Moreover, our model can also be generalized to fibroblasts during repair and fibrosis in other tissues.
30357379	2019	Nucleic acids research	EndoDB: a database of endothelial cell transcriptomics data.	Endothelial cells (ECs) line blood vessels, regulate homeostatic processes (blood flow, immune cell trafficking), but are also involved in many prevalent diseases. The increasing use of high-throughput technologies such as gene expression microarrays and (single cell) RNA sequencing generated a wealth of data on the molecular basis of EC (dys-)function. Extracting biological insight from these datasets is challenging for scientists who are not proficient in bioinformatics. To facilitate the re-use of publicly available EC transcriptomics data, we developed the endothelial database EndoDB, a web-accessible collection of expert curated, quality assured and pre-analyzed data collected from 360 datasets comprising a total of 4741 bulk and 5847 single cell endothelial transcriptomes from six different organisms. Unlike other added-value databases, EndoDB allows to easily retrieve and explore data of specific studies, determine under which conditions genes and pathways of interest are deregulated and assess reprogramming of metabolism via principal component analysis, differential gene expression analysis, gene set enrichment analysis, heatmaps and metabolic and transcription factor analysis, while single cell data are visualized as gene expression color-coded t-SNE plots. Plots and tables in EndoDB are customizable, downloadable and interactive. EndoDB is freely available at https://vibcancer.be/software-tools/endodb, and will be updated to include new studies.
31870423	2019	Genome biology	Normalization and variance stabilization of single-cell RNA-seq data using regularized negative binomial regression.	"Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data exhibits significant cell-to-cell variation due to technical factors, including the number of molecules detected in each cell, which can confound biological heterogeneity with technical effects. To address this, we present a modeling framework for the normalization and variance stabilization of molecular count data from scRNA-seq experiments. We propose that the Pearson residuals from ""regularized negative binomial regression,"" where cellular sequencing depth is utilized as a covariate in a generalized linear model, successfully remove the influence of technical characteristics from downstream analyses while preserving biological heterogeneity. Importantly, we show that an unconstrained negative binomial model may overfit scRNA-seq data, and overcome this by pooling information across genes with similar abundances to obtain stable parameter estimates. Our procedure omits the need for heuristic steps including pseudocount addition or log-transformation and improves common downstream analytical tasks such as variable gene selection, dimensional reduction, and differential expression. Our approach can be applied to any UMI-based scRNA-seq dataset and is freely available as part of the R package sctransform, with a direct interface to our single-cell toolkit Seurat."
30596898	2019	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Single-cell RNA-seq interpretations using evolutionary multiobjective ensemble pruning.	MOTIVATION: In recent years, single-cell RNA sequencing enables us to discover cell types or even subtypes. Its increasing availability provides opportunities to identify cell populations from single-cell RNA-seq data. Computational methods have been employed to reveal the gene expression variations among multiple cell populations. Unfortunately, the existing ones can suffer from realistic restrictions such as experimental noises, numerical instability, high dimensionality and computational scalability. RESULTS: We propose an evolutionary multiobjective ensemble pruning algorithm (EMEP) that addresses those realistic restrictions. Our EMEP algorithm first applies the unsupervised dimensionality reduction to project data from the original high dimensions to low-dimensional subspaces; basic clustering algorithms are applied in those new subspaces to generate different clustering results to form cluster ensembles. However, most of those cluster ensembles are unnecessarily bulky with the expense of extra time costs and memory consumption. To overcome that problem, EMEP is designed to dynamically select the suitable clustering results from the ensembles. Moreover, to guide the multiobjective ensemble evolution, three cluster validity indices including the overall cluster deviation, the within-cluster compactness and the number of basic partition clusters are formulated as the objective functions to unleash its cell type discovery performance using evolutionary multiobjective optimization. We applied EMEP to 55 simulated datasets and seven real single-cell RNA-seq datasets, including six single-cell RNA-seq dataset and one large-scale dataset with 3005 cells and 4412 genes. Two case studies are also conducted to reveal mechanistic insights into the biological relevance of EMEP. We found that EMEP can achieve superior performance over the other clustering algorithms, demonstrating that EMEP can identify cell populations clearly. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: EMEP is written in Matlab and available at https://github.com/lixt314/EMEP. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
33888511	2021	Genome research	Comprehensive characterization of tissue-specific chromatin accessibility in L2 Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes.	Recently developed single-cell technologies allow researchers to characterize cell states at ever greater resolution and scale. Caenorhabditis elegans is a particularly tractable system for studying development, and recent single-cell RNA-seq studies characterized the gene expression patterns for nearly every cell type in the embryo and at the second larval stage (L2). Gene expression patterns give insight about gene function and into the biochemical state of different cell types; recent advances in other single-cell genomics technologies can now also characterize the regulatory context of the genome that gives rise to these gene expression levels at a single-cell resolution. To explore the regulatory DNA of individual cell types in C. elegans, we collected single-cell chromatin accessibility data using the sci-ATAC-seq assay in L2 larvae to match the available single-cell RNA-seq data set. By using a novel implementation of the latent Dirichlet allocation algorithm, we identify 37 clusters of cells that correspond to different cell types in the worm, providing new maps of putative cell type-specific gene regulatory sites, with promise for better understanding of cellular differentiation and gene regulation.
27534536	2016	Genome biology	Single-cell RNA-seq reveals novel regulators of human embryonic stem cell differentiation to definitive endoderm.	BACKGROUND: Human pluripotent stem cells offer the best available model to study the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of human embryonic lineage specification. However, it is not fully understood how individual stem cells exit the pluripotent state and transition towards their respective progenitor states. RESULTS: Here, we analyze the transcriptomes of human embryonic stem cell-derived lineage-specific progenitors by single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). We identify a definitive endoderm (DE) transcriptomic signature that leads us to pinpoint a critical time window when DE differentiation is enhanced by hypoxia. The molecular mechanisms governing the emergence of DE are further examined by time course scRNA-seq experiments, employing two new statistical tools to identify stage-specific genes over time (SCPattern) and to reconstruct the differentiation trajectory from the pluripotent state through mesendoderm to DE (Wave-Crest). Importantly, presumptive DE cells can be detected during the transitory phase from Brachyury (T) (+) mesendoderm toward a CXCR4 (+) DE state. Novel regulators are identified within this time window and are functionally validated on a screening platform with a T-2A-EGFP knock-in reporter engineered by CRISPR/Cas9. Through loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments, we demonstrate that KLF8 plays a pivotal role modulating mesendoderm to DE differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: We report the analysis of 1776 cells by scRNA-seq covering distinct human embryonic stem cell-derived progenitor states. By reconstructing a differentiation trajectory at single-cell resolution, novel regulators of the mesendoderm transition to DE are elucidated and validated. Our strategy of combining single-cell analysis and genetic approaches can be applied to uncover novel regulators governing cell fate decisions in a variety of systems.
39919147	2025	PLoS computational biology	Identifying patterns differing between high-dimensional datasets with generalized contrastive PCA.	High-dimensional data have become ubiquitous in the biological sciences, and it is often desirable to compare two datasets collected under different experimental conditions to extract low-dimensional patterns enriched in one condition. However, traditional dimensionality reduction techniques cannot accomplish this because they operate on only one dataset. Contrastive principal component analysis (cPCA) has been proposed to address this problem, but it has seen little adoption because it requires tuning a hyperparameter resulting in multiple solutions, with no way of knowing which is correct. Moreover, cPCA uses foreground and background conditions that are treated differently, making it ill-suited to compare two experimental conditions symmetrically. Here we describe the development of generalized contrastive PCA (gcPCA), a flexible hyperparameter-free approach that solves these problems. We first provide analyses explaining why cPCA requires a hyperparameter and how gcPCA avoids this requirement. We then describe an open-source gcPCA toolbox containing Python and MATLAB implementations of several variants of gcPCA tailored for different scenarios. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of gcPCA in analyzing diverse high-dimensional biological data, revealing unsupervised detection of hippocampal replay in neurophysiological recordings and heterogeneity of type II diabetes in single-cell RNA sequencing data. As a fast, robust, and easy-to-use comparison method, gcPCA provides a valuable resource facilitating the analysis of diverse high-dimensional datasets to gain new insights into complex biological phenomena.
40471703	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	SNACS: a tool for demultiplexing single-cell DNA sequencing data.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq) and multi-modal profiling with the addition of cell-surface antibodies (scDAb-seq) have recently provided key insights into cancer heterogeneity. Scaling these technologies across large patient cohorts, however, is cost and time prohibitive. Multiplexing, in which cells from unique patients are pooled into a single experiment, offers a possible solution. While multiplexing methods exist for scRNAseq, accurate demultiplexing in scDNAseq remains an unmet need. RESULTS: Here, we introduce SNACS: single-nucleotide polymorphism and antibody-based cell sorting. SNACS relies on a combination of patient-level cell-surface identifiers and natural variation in genetic polymorphisms to demultiplex scDNAseq data. We demonstrated the performance of SNACS on a dataset consisting of multi-sample experiments from patients with leukemia where we knew truth from single-sample experiments from the same patients. Using SNACS, accuracy ranged from 0.948 to 0.991 versus 0.552 to 0.934 using demultiplexing methods from the single-cell literature. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: SNACS is available at  https://github.com/olshena/SNACS.

38192003	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	FAVA: high-quality functional association networks inferred from scRNA-seq and proteomics data.	MOTIVATION: Protein networks are commonly used for understanding how proteins interact. However, they are typically biased by data availability, favoring well-studied proteins with more interactions. To uncover functions of understudied proteins, we must use data that are not affected by this literature bias, such as single-cell RNA-seq and proteomics. Due to data sparseness and redundancy, functional association analysis becomes complex. RESULTS: To address this, we have developed FAVA (Functional Associations using Variational Autoencoders), which compresses high-dimensional data into a low-dimensional space. FAVA infers networks from high-dimensional omics data with much higher accuracy than existing methods, across a diverse collection of real as well as simulated datasets. FAVA can process large datasets with over 0.5 million conditions and has predicted 4210 interactions between 1039 understudied proteins.

33602306	2021	Genome biology	iMAP: integration of multiple single-cell datasets by adversarial paired transfer networks.	The integration of single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets from multiple sources is critical for deciphering cell-to-cell heterogeneities and interactions in complex biological systems. We present a novel unsupervised batch effect removal framework, called iMAP, based on both deep autoencoders and generative adversarial networks. Compared with current methods, iMAP shows superior, robust, and scalable performance in terms of both reliably detecting the batch-specific cells and effectively mixing distributions of the batch-shared cell types. Applying iMAP to tumor microenvironment datasets from two platforms, Smart-seq2 and 10x Genomics, we find that iMAP can leverage the powers of both platforms to discover novel cell-cell interactions.
36198490	2022	Genome research	A model-based constrained deep learning clustering approach for spatially resolved single-cell data.	Spatially resolved scRNA-seq (sp-scRNA-seq) technologies provide the potential to comprehensively profile gene expression patterns in tissue context. However, the development of computational methods lags behind the advances in these technologies, which limits the fulfillment of their potential. In this study, we develop a deep learning approach for clustering sp-scRNA-seq data, named Deep Spatially constrained Single-cell Clustering (DSSC). In this model, we integrate the spatial information of cells into the clustering process in two steps: (1) the spatial information is encoded by using a graphical neural network model, and (2) cell-to-cell constraints are built based on the spatial expression pattern of the marker genes and added in the model to guide the clustering process. Then, a deep embedding clustering is performed on the bottleneck layer of autoencoder by Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence along with the learning of feature representation. DSSC is the first model that can use information from both spatial coordinates and marker genes to guide cell/spot clustering. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real data sets show that DSSC boosts clustering performance significantly compared with the state-of-the-art methods. It has robust performance across different data sets with various cell type/tissue organization and/or cell type/tissue spatial dependency. We conclude that DSSC is a promising tool for clustering sp-scRNA-seq data.
40165295	2025	Genome biology	Chromosome-level genome assembly and single-cell analysis unveil molecular mechanisms of arm regeneration in the ophiuroid Ophiura sarsii vadicola.	BACKGROUND: Ophiuroids, belonging to Ophiuroidea in Echinodermata, possess remarkable regenerative capacities in their arms, relying on cellular recruitment and de-differentiation. However, limited high-quality genomic resources have hindered the investigation of the underlying molecular mechanisms of ophiuroid regeneration. RESULTS: Here, we report a chromosome-level genome of Ophiura sarsii vadicola, 259.28 Mbp in length with a scaffold N50 length of 66.91 Mbp. We then perform bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing analysis to investigate gene expression and cellular dynamics during arm regeneration. We identify five distinct cellular clusters involved in the arm regeneration and infer the dynamic transformations from sensory stimulation to injury response, wound healing, and tissue regeneration. We find that progenitor cells derived from connective tissue cells differentiate into muscle, cartilage, endothelial, and epithelial cells. Pseudotime analysis indicates that muscle differentiation occurs early in the regeneration process. CONCLUSIONS: Our genomic resource and single-cell atlas shed light on the mechanisms of organ regeneration in ophiuroids.
39115884	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Pseudobulk with proper offsets has the same statistical properties as generalized linear mixed models in single-cell case-control studies.	MOTIVATION: Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs), such as the negative-binomial or Poisson linear mixed model, are widely applied to single-cell RNA sequencing data to compare transcript expression between different conditions determined at the subject level. However, the model is computationally intensive, and its relative statistical performance to pseudobulk approaches is poorly understood. RESULTS: We propose offset-pseudobulk as a lightweight alternative to GLMMs. We prove that a count-based pseudobulk equipped with a proper offset variable has the same statistical properties as GLMMs in terms of both point estimates and standard errors. We confirm our findings using simulations based on real data. Offset-pseudobulk is substantially faster (>x10) and numerically more stable than GLMMs. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Offset pseudobulk can be easily implemented in any generalized linear model software by tweaking a few options. The codes can be found at https://github.com/hanbin973/pseudobulk_is_mm.
33017003	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	VIRTUS: a pipeline for comprehensive virus analysis from conventional RNA-seq data.	SUMMARY: The possibility that RNA transcripts from clinical samples contain plenty of virus RNAs has not been pursued actively so far. We here developed a new tool for analyzing virus-transcribed mRNAs, not virus copy numbers, in the data of bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing of human cells. Our pipeline, named VIRTUS (VIRal Transcript Usage Sensor), was able to detect 762 viruses including herpesviruses, retroviruses and even SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), and quantify their transcripts in the sequence data. This tool thus enabled simultaneously detecting infected cells, the composition of multiple viruses within the cell, and the endogenous host-gene expression profile of the cell. This bioinformatics method would be instrumental in addressing the possible effects of covertly infecting viruses on certain diseases and developing new treatments to target such viruses. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: : VIRTUS is implemented using Common Workflow Language and Docker under a CC-NC license. VIRTUS is freely available at https://github.com/yyoshiaki/VIRTUS. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
29030468	2017	Genome research	Assessing the reliability of spike-in normalization for analyses of single-cell RNA sequencing data.	By profiling the transcriptomes of individual cells, single-cell RNA sequencing provides unparalleled resolution to study cellular heterogeneity. However, this comes at the cost of high technical noise, including cell-specific biases in capture efficiency and library generation. One strategy for removing these biases is to add a constant amount of spike-in RNA to each cell and to scale the observed expression values so that the coverage of spike-in transcripts is constant across cells. This approach has previously been criticized as its accuracy depends on the precise addition of spike-in RNA to each sample. Here, we perform mixture experiments using two different sets of spike-in RNA to quantify the variance in the amount of spike-in RNA added to each well in a plate-based protocol. We also obtain an upper bound on the variance due to differences in behavior between the two spike-in sets. We demonstrate that both factors are small contributors to the total technical variance and have only minor effects on downstream analyses, such as detection of highly variable genes and clustering. Our results suggest that scaling normalization using spike-in transcripts is reliable enough for routine use in single-cell RNA sequencing data analyses.
33974009	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	VeTra: a tool for trajectory inference based on RNA velocity.	MOTIVATION: Trajectory inference (TI) for single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data is a powerful approach to interpret dynamic cellular processes such as cell cycle and development. Still, however, accurate inference of trajectory is challenging. Recent development of RNA velocity provides an approach to visualize cell state transition without relying on prior knowledge. RESULTS: To perform TI and group cells based on RNA velocity we developed VeTra. By applying cosine similarity and merging weakly connected components, VeTra identifies cell groups from the direction of cell transition. Besides, VeTra suggests key regulators from the inferred trajectory. VeTra is a useful tool for TI and subsequent analysis. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The Vetra is available at https://github.com/wgzgithub/VeTra. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
29617963	2018	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Detecting hidden batch factors through data-adaptive adjustment for biological effects.	MOTIVATION: Batch effects are one of the major source of technical variations that affect the measurements in high-throughput studies such as RNA sequencing. It has been well established that batch effects can be caused by different experimental platforms, laboratory conditions, different sources of samples and personnel differences. These differences can confound the outcomes of interest and lead to spurious results. A critical input for batch correction algorithms is the knowledge of batch factors, which in many cases are unknown or inaccurate. Hence, the primary motivation of our paper is to detect hidden batch factors that can be used in standard techniques to accurately capture the relationship between gene expression and other modeled variables of interest. RESULTS: We introduce a new algorithm based on data-adaptive shrinkage and semi-Non-negative Matrix Factorization for the detection of unknown batch effects. We test our algorithm on three different datasets: (i) Sequencing Quality Control, (ii) Topotecan RNA-Seq and (iii) Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) on Glioblastoma Multiforme. We have demonstrated a superior performance in identifying hidden batch effects as compared to existing algorithms for batch detection in all three datasets. In the Topotecan study, we were able to identify a new batch factor that has been missed by the original study, leading to under-representation of differentially expressed genes. For scRNA-Seq, we demonstrated the power of our method in detecting subtle batch effects. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: DASC R package is available via Bioconductor or at https://github.com/zhanglabNKU/DASC. CONTACT: zhanghan@nankai.edu.cn or zhandonl@bcm.edu.

34906205	2021	Genome biology	Benchmarking UMI-based single-cell RNA-seq preprocessing workflows.	BACKGROUND: Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies and associated analysis methods have rapidly developed in recent years. This includes preprocessing methods, which assign sequencing reads to genes to create count matrices for downstream analysis. While several packaged preprocessing workflows have been developed to provide users with convenient tools for handling this process, how they compare to one another and how they influence downstream analysis have not been well studied. RESULTS: Here, we systematically benchmark the performance of 10 end-to-end preprocessing workflows (Cell Ranger, Optimus, salmon alevin, alevin-fry, kallisto bustools, dropSeqPipe, scPipe, zUMIs, celseq2, and scruff) using datasets yielding different biological complexity levels generated by CEL-Seq2 and 10x Chromium platforms. We compare these workflows in terms of their quantification properties directly and their impact on normalization and clustering by evaluating the performance of different method combinations. While the scRNA-seq preprocessing workflows compared vary in their detection and quantification of genes across datasets, after downstream analysis with performant normalization and clustering methods, almost all combinations produce clustering results that agree well with the known cell type labels that provided the ground truth in our analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the choice of preprocessing method was found to be less important than other steps in the scRNA-seq analysis process. Our study comprehensively compares common scRNA-seq preprocessing workflows and summarizes their characteristics to guide workflow users.
37798781	2023	Genome biology	MCProj: metacell projection for interpretable and quantitative use of transcriptional atlases.	We describe MCProj-an algorithm for analyzing query scRNA-seq data by projections over reference single-cell atlases. We represent the reference as a manifold of annotated metacell gene expression distributions. We then interpret query metacells as mixtures of atlas distributions while correcting for technology-specific gene biases. This approach distinguishes and tags query cells that are consistent with atlas states from unobserved (novel or artifactual) behaviors. It also identifies expression differences observed in successfully mapped query states. We showcase MCProj functionality by projecting scRNA-seq data on a blood cell atlas, deriving precise, quantitative, and interpretable results across technologies and datasets.
35063006	2022	Genome biology	Statistics or biology: the zero-inflation controversy about scRNA-seq data.	Researchers view vast zeros in single-cell RNA-seq data differently: some regard zeros as biological signals representing no or low gene expression, while others regard zeros as missing data to be corrected. To help address the controversy, here we discuss the sources of biological and non-biological zeros; introduce five mechanisms of adding non-biological zeros in computational benchmarking; evaluate the impacts of non-biological zeros on data analysis; benchmark three input data types: observed counts, imputed counts, and binarized counts; discuss the open questions regarding non-biological zeros; and advocate the importance of transparent analysis.
33611426	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	Accurate feature selection improves single-cell RNA-seq cell clustering.	Cell clustering is one of the most important and commonly performed tasks in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis. An important step in cell clustering is to select a subset of genes (referred to as 'features'), whose expression patterns will then be used for downstream clustering. A good set of features should include the ones that distinguish different cell types, and the quality of such set could have a significant impact on the clustering accuracy. All existing scRNA-seq clustering tools include a feature selection step relying on some simple unsupervised feature selection methods, mostly based on the statistical moments of gene-wise expression distributions. In this work, we carefully evaluate the impact of feature selection on cell clustering accuracy. In addition, we develop a feature selection algorithm named FEAture SelecTion (FEAST), which provides more representative features. We apply the method on 12 public scRNA-seq datasets and demonstrate that using features selected by FEAST with existing clustering tools significantly improve the clustering accuracy.
31937974	2020	Nature biotechnology	Droplet scRNA-seq is not zero-inflated.	
41203866	2025	Nature methods	Monod: model-based discovery and integration through fitting stochastic transcriptional dynamics to single-cell sequencing data.	Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis centers on illuminating cell diversity and understanding the transcriptional mechanisms underlying cellular function. These datasets are large, noisy and complex. Current analyses prioritize noise removal and dimensionality reduction to tackle these challenges and extract biological insight. We propose an alternative, physical approach to leverage the stochasticity, size and multimodal nature of these data to explicitly distinguish their biological and technical facets while revealing the underlying regulatory processes. With the Python package Monod, we demonstrate how nascent and mature RNA counts, present in most published datasets, can be meaningfully 'integrated' under biophysical models of transcription. By using variation in these modalities, we can identify transcriptional modulation not discernible through changes in average gene expression, quantitatively compare mechanistic hypotheses of gene regulation, analyze transcriptional data from different technologies within a common framework and minimize the use of opaque or distortive normalization and transformation techniques.
40439670	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	scaLR: a low-resource deep neural network-based platform for single cell analysis and biomarker discovery.	Single-cell ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing (scRNA-seq) produces vast amounts of individual cell profiling data. Its analysis presents a significant challenge in accurately annotating cell types and their associated biomarkers. Different pipelines based on deep neural network (DNN) methods have been employed to tackle these issues. These pipelines have arisen as a promising resource and can extract meaningful and concise features from noisy, diverse, and high-dimensional data to enhance annotations and subsequent analysis. Existing tools require high computational resources to execute large sample datasets. We have developed a cutting-edge platform known as scaLR (Single-cell analysis using low resource) that efficiently processes data into feature subsets, samples in batches to reduce the required memory for processing large datasets, and running DNN models in multiple central processing units. scaLR is equipped with data processing, feature extraction, training, evaluation, and downstream analysis. Its novel feature extraction algorithm first trains the model on a feature subset and stores the importance of the features for all the features in that subset. At the end of the training of all subsets, the top-K features are selected based on their importance. The final model is trained on top-K features; its performance evaluation and associated downstream analysis provide significant biomarkers for different cell types and diseases/traits. Our findings indicate that scaLR offers comparable prediction accuracy and requires less model training time and computational resources than existing Python-based pipelines. We present scaLR, a Python-based platform, engineered to utilize minimal computational resources while maintaining comparable execution times and analysis costs to existing frameworks.
25887790	2015	Genome biology	Single-cell analysis of lung adenocarcinoma cell lines reveals diverse expression patterns of individual cells invoked by a molecular target drug treatment.	BACKGROUND: To understand the heterogeneous behaviors of individual cancer cells, it is essential to investigate gene expression levels as well as their divergence between different individual cells. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing-related technologies have enabled us to conduct a single-cell RNA-Seq analysis of a series of lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. RESULTS: We analyze a total of 336 single-cell RNA-Seq libraries from seven cell lines. The results are highly robust regarding both average expression levels and the relative gene expression differences between individual cells. Gene expression diversity is characteristic depending on genes and pathways. Analyses of individual cells treated with the multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor vandetanib reveal that, while the ribosomal genes and many other so-called house-keeping genes reduce their relative expression diversity during the drug treatment, the genes that are directly targeted by vandetanib, the EGFR and RET genes, remain constant. Rigid transcriptional control of these genes may not allow plastic changes of their expression with the drug treatment or during the cellular acquisition of drug resistance. Additionally, we find that the gene expression patterns of cancer-related genes are sometimes more diverse than expected based on the founder cells. Furthermore, we find that this diversity is occasionally latent in a normal state and initially becomes apparent after the drug treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Characteristic patterns in gene expression divergence, which would not be revealed by transcriptome analysis of bulk cells, may also play important roles when cells acquire drug resistance, perhaps by providing a cellular reservoir for gene expression programs.
37328900	2023	Genome biology	Synergising single-cell resolution and 4sU labelling boosts inference of transcriptional bursting.	Despite the recent rise of RNA-seq datasets combining single-cell (sc) resolution with 4-thiouridine (4sU) labelling, analytical methods exploiting their power to dissect transcriptional bursting are lacking. Here, we present a mathematical model and Bayesian inference implementation to facilitate genome-wide joint parameter estimation and confidence quantification (R package: burstMCMC). We demonstrate that, unlike conventional scRNA-seq, 4sU scRNA-seq resolves temporal parameters and furthermore boosts inference of dimensionless parameters via a synergy between single-cell resolution and 4sU labelling. We apply our method to published 4sU scRNA-seq data and linked with ChIP-seq data, we uncover previously obscured associations between different parameters and histone modifications.
35362513	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	Sincast: a computational framework to predict cell identities in single-cell transcriptomes using bulk atlases as references.	Characterizing the molecular identity of a cell is an essential step in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis. Numerous tools exist for predicting cell identity using single-cell reference atlases. However, many challenges remain, including correcting for inherent batch effects between reference and query data andinsufficient phenotype data from the reference. One solution is to project single-cell data onto established bulk reference atlases to leverage their rich phenotype information. Sincast is a computational framework to query scRNA-seq data by projection onto bulk reference atlases. Prior to projection, single-cell data are transformed to be directly comparable to bulk data, either with pseudo-bulk aggregation or graph-based imputation to address sparse single-cell expression profiles. Sincast avoids batch effect correction, and cell identity is predicted along a continuum to highlight new cell states not found in the reference atlas. In several case study scenarios, we show that Sincast projects single cells into the correct biological niches in the expression space of the bulk reference atlas. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our imputation approach that was specifically developed for querying scRNA-seq data based on bulk reference atlases. We show that Sincast is an efficient and powerful tool for single-cell profiling that will facilitate downstream analysis of scRNA-seq data.
31697351	2019	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scGEAToolbox: a Matlab toolbox for single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis.	"MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has revolutionized the way research is done in biomedical sciences. It provides an unprecedented level of resolution across individual cells for studying cell heterogeneity and gene expression variability. Analyzing scRNA-seq data is challenging though, due to the sparsity and high dimensionality of the data. RESULTS: I developed scGEAToolbox-a Matlab toolbox for scRNA-seq data analysis. It contains a comprehensive set of functions for data normalization, feature selection, batch correction, imputation, cell clustering, trajectory/pseudotime analysis, and network construction, which can be combined and integrated to building custom workflow.

33685491	2021	Genome biology	Giotto: a toolbox for integrative analysis and visualization of spatial expression data.	Spatial transcriptomic and proteomic technologies have provided new opportunities to investigate cells in their native microenvironment. Here we present Giotto, a comprehensive and open-source toolbox for spatial data analysis and visualization. The analysis module provides end-to-end analysis by implementing a wide range of algorithms for characterizing tissue composition, spatial expression patterns, and cellular interactions. Furthermore, single-cell RNAseq data can be integrated for spatial cell-type enrichment analysis. The visualization module allows users to interactively visualize analysis outputs and imaging features. To demonstrate its general applicability, we apply Giotto to a wide range of datasets encompassing diverse technologies and platforms.
35561178	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	EDClust: an EM-MM hybrid method for cell clustering in multiple-subject single-cell RNA sequencing.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized biological research by enabling the measurement of transcriptomic profiles at the single-cell level. With the increasing application of scRNA-seq in larger-scale studies, the problem of appropriately clustering cells emerges when the scRNA-seq data are from multiple subjects. One challenge is the subject-specific variation; systematic heterogeneity from multiple subjects may have a significant impact on clustering accuracy. Existing methods seeking to address such effects suffer from several limitations. RESULTS: We develop a novel statistical method, EDClust, for multi-subject scRNA-seq cell clustering. EDClust models the sequence read counts by a mixture of Dirichlet-multinomial distributions and explicitly accounts for cell-type heterogeneity, subject heterogeneity and clustering uncertainty. An EM-MM hybrid algorithm is derived for maximizing the data likelihood and clustering the cells. We perform a series of simulation studies to evaluate the proposed method and demonstrate the outstanding performance of EDClust. Comprehensive benchmarking on four real scRNA-seq datasets with various tissue types and species demonstrates the substantial accuracy improvement of EDClust compared to existing methods. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The R package is freely available at https://github.com/weix21/EDClust. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
27566152	2016	Nucleic acids research	Single-nucleus RNA-seq of differentiating human myoblasts reveals the extent of fate heterogeneity.	Myoblasts are precursor skeletal muscle cells that differentiate into fused, multinucleated myotubes. Current single-cell microfluidic methods are not optimized for capturing very large, multinucleated cells such as myotubes. To circumvent the problem, we performed single-nucleus transcriptome analysis. Using immortalized human myoblasts, we performed RNA-seq analysis of single cells (scRNA-seq) and single nuclei (snRNA-seq) and found them comparable, with a distinct enrichment for long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in snRNA-seq. We then compared snRNA-seq of myoblasts before and after differentiation. We observed the presence of mononucleated cells (MNCs) that remained unfused and analyzed separately from multi-nucleated myotubes. We found that while the transcriptome profiles of myoblast and myotube nuclei are relatively homogeneous, MNC nuclei exhibited significant heterogeneity, with the majority of them adopting a distinct mesenchymal state. Primary transcripts for microRNAs (miRNAs) that participate in skeletal muscle differentiation were among the most differentially expressed lncRNAs, which we validated using NanoString. Our study demonstrates that snRNA-seq provides reliable transcriptome quantification for cells that are otherwise not amenable to current single-cell platforms. Our results further indicate that snRNA-seq has unique advantage in capturing nucleus-enriched lncRNAs and miRNA precursors that are useful in mapping and monitoring differential miRNA expression during cellular differentiation.
38111007	2023	Genome biology	scNAT: a deep learning method for integrating paired single-cell RNA and T cell receptor sequencing profiles.	Many deep learning-based methods have been proposed to handle complex single-cell data. Deep learning approaches may also prove useful to jointly analyze single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell T cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq) data for novel discoveries. We developed scNAT, a deep learning method that integrates paired scRNA-seq and scTCR-seq data to represent data in a unified latent space for downstream analysis. We demonstrate that scNAT is capable of removing batch effects, and identifying cell clusters and a T cell migration trajectory from blood to cerebrospinal fluid in multiple sclerosis.
34913057	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	scIAE: an integrative autoencoder-based ensemble classification framework for single-cell RNA-seq data.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows quantitative analysis of gene expression at the level of single cells, beneficial to study cell heterogeneity. The recognition of cell types facilitates the construction of cell atlas in complex tissues or organisms, which is the basis of almost all downstream scRNA-seq data analyses. Using disease-related scRNA-seq data to perform the prediction of disease status can facilitate the specific diagnosis and personalized treatment of disease. Since single-cell gene expression data are high-dimensional and sparse with dropouts, we propose scIAE, an integrative autoencoder-based ensemble classification framework, to firstly perform multiple random projections and apply integrative and devisable autoencoders (integrating stacked, denoising and sparse autoencoders) to obtain compressed representations. Then base classifiers are built on the lower-dimensional representations and the predictions from all base models are integrated. The comparison of scIAE and common feature extraction methods shows that scIAE is effective and robust, independent of the choice of dimension, which is beneficial to subsequent cell classification. By testing scIAE on different types of data and comparing it with existing general and single-cell-specific classification methods, it is proven that scIAE has a great classification power in cell type annotation intradataset, across batches, across platforms and across species, and also disease status prediction. The architecture of scIAE is flexible and devisable, and it is available at https://github.com/JGuan-lab/scIAE.

35313930	2022	Genome biology	scINSIGHT for interpreting single-cell gene expression from biologically heterogeneous data.	The increasing number of scRNA-seq data emphasizes the need for integrative analysis to interpret similarities and differences between single-cell samples. Although different batch effect removal methods have been developed, none are suitable for heterogeneous single-cell samples coming from multiple biological conditions. We propose a method, scINSIGHT, to learn coordinated gene expression patterns that are common among, or specific to, different biological conditions, and identify cellular identities and processes across single-cell samples. We compare scINSIGHT with state-of-the-art methods using simulated and real data, which demonstrate its improved performance. Our results show the applicability of scINSIGHT in diverse biomedical and clinical problems.
41335468	2025	Nucleic acids research	CelLink: integrating single-cell multi-omics data with weak feature linkage and imbalanced cell populations.	Single-cell multi-omics technologies capture complementary molecular layers, enabling a comprehensive view of cellular states and functions. However, integrating these data types poses significant challenges when their features are weakly linked and cell population sizes are imbalanced. Currently, no method efficiently addresses these two issues simultaneously. Therefore, we developed CelLink, a novel single-cell multi-omics data integration method designed to overcome these challenges. CelLink normalizes and smooths feature profiles to align scales across datasets and integrates them through a multi-phase pipeline that iteratively employs the optimal transport algorithm. It dynamically refines cell-cell correspondences, identifying and excluding cells that cannot be reliably matched, thus avoiding performance degradation caused by erroneous imputations. This approach effectively adapts to weak feature linkage and imbalanced cell populations between datasets. Benchmarking CelLink on scRNA-seq and spatial proteomics datasets, as well as paired CITE-seq data, demonstrates its superior performance across various evaluation metrics, including data mixing, cell manifold structure preservation, and feature imputation accuracy. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, CelLink significantly outperforms others in imbalanced cell populations while consistently achieving better performance for balanced datasets. Moreover, CelLink uniquely enables cell subtype annotation, correction of mislabeled cells, and spatial transcriptomic analyses by imputing transcriptomic profiles for spatial proteomics data. Its great ability to impute large-scale paired single-cell multi-omics data positions it pivotal for building single-cell multi-modal foundation models and spatial cellular biology.
35468967	2022	Nature methods	Molecular spikes: a gold standard for single-cell RNA counting.	Single-cell sequencing methods rely on molecule-counting strategies to account for amplification biases, yet no experimental strategy to evaluate counting performance exists. Here, we introduce molecular spikes-RNA spike-ins containing built-in unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) that we use to identify critical experimental and computational conditions for accurate RNA counting in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). Using molecular spikes, we uncovered impaired RNA counting in methods that were not informative for cellular RNA abundances due to inflated UMI counts. We further leverage molecular spikes to improve estimates of total endogenous RNA amounts in cells, and introduce a strategy to correct experiments with impaired RNA counting. The molecular spikes and the accompanying R package UMIcountR ( https://github.com/cziegenhain/UMIcountR ) will improve the validation of new methods, better estimate and adjust for cellular mRNA amounts and enable more indepth characterization of RNA counting in scRNA-seq.
37085823	2023	Genome biology	Consequences and opportunities arising due to sparser single-cell RNA-seq datasets.	With the number of cells measured in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets increasing exponentially and concurrent increased sparsity due to more zero counts being measured for many genes, we demonstrate here that downstream analyses on binary-based gene expression give similar results as count-based analyses. Moreover, a binary representation scales up to ~ 50-fold more cells that can be analyzed using the same computational resources. We also highlight the possibilities provided by binarized scRNA-seq data. Development of specialized tools for bit-aware implementations of downstream analytical tasks will enable a more fine-grained resolution of biological heterogeneity.
38478395	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scPathoQuant: a tool for efficient alignment and quantification of pathogen sequence reads from 10x single cell sequencing datasets.	MOTIVATION: Currently there is a lack of efficient computational pipelines/tools for conducting simultaneous genome mapping of pathogen-derived and host reads from single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) output from pathogen-infected cells. Contemporary options include processes involving multiple steps and/or running multiple computational tools, increasing user operations time. RESULTS: To address the need for new tools to directly map and quantify pathogen and host sequence reads from within an infected cell from scRNAseq datasets in a single operation, we have built a python package, called scPathoQuant. scPathoQuant extracts sequences that were not aligned to the primary host genome, maps them to a pathogen genome of interest (here as demonstrated for viral pathogens), quantifies total reads mapping to the entire pathogen, quantifies reads mapping to individual pathogen genes, and finally integrates pathogen sequence counts into matrix files that are used by standard single cell pipelines for downstream analyses with only one command. We demonstrate that scPathoQuant provides a scRNAseq viral and host genome-wide sequence read abundance analysis that can differentiate and define multiple viruses in a single sample scRNAseq output. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The SPQ package is available software accessible at https://github.com/galelab/scPathoQuant (DOI 10.5281/zenodo.10463670) with test codes and datasets available https://github.com/galelab/Whitmore_scPathoQuant_testSets (DOI 10.5281/zenodo.10463677) to serve as a resource for the community.
32955565	2020	Nucleic acids research	SpaGE: Spatial Gene Enhancement using scRNA-seq.	Single-cell technologies are emerging fast due to their ability to unravel the heterogeneity of biological systems. While scRNA-seq is a powerful tool that measures whole-transcriptome expression of single cells, it lacks their spatial localization. Novel spatial transcriptomics methods do retain cells spatial information but some methods can only measure tens to hundreds of transcripts. To resolve this discrepancy, we developed SpaGE, a method that integrates spatial and scRNA-seq datasets to predict whole-transcriptome expressions in their spatial configuration. Using five dataset-pairs, SpaGE outperformed previously published methods and showed scalability to large datasets. Moreover, SpaGE predicted new spatial gene patterns that are confirmed independently using in situ hybridization data from the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas.
39466833	2024	PLoS computational biology	Mcadet: A feature selection method for fine-resolution single-cell RNA-seq data based on multiple correspondence analysis and community detection.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis faces numerous challenges, including high sparsity, a high-dimensional feature space, and biological noise. These challenges hinder downstream analysis, necessitating the use of feature selection methods to identify informative genes, and reduce data dimensionality. However, existing methods for selecting highly variable genes (HVGs) exhibit limited overlap and inconsistent clustering performance across benchmark datasets. Moreover, these methods often struggle to accurately select HVGs from fine-resolution scRNA-seq datasets and minority cell types, which are more difficult to distinguish, raising concerns about the reliability of their results. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel feature selection framework for scRNA-seq data called Mcadet. Mcadet integrates Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), graph-based community detection, and a novel statistical testing approach. To assess the effectiveness of Mcadet, we conducted extensive evaluations using both simulated and real-world data, employing unbiased metrics for comparison. Our results demonstrate the superior performance of Mcadet in the selection of HVGs in scenarios involving fine-resolution scRNA-seq datasets and datasets containing minority cell populations. Overall, we demonstrate that Mcadet enhances the reliability of selected HVGs, although the impact of HVG selection on various downstream analyses varies and needs to be further investigated.
30917859	2019	Genome biology	Alevin efficiently estimates accurate gene abundances from dscRNA-seq data.	We introduce alevin, a fast end-to-end pipeline to process droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing data, performing cell barcode detection, read mapping, unique molecular identifier (UMI) deduplication, gene count estimation, and cell barcode whitelisting. Alevin's approach to UMI deduplication considers transcript-level constraints on the molecules from which UMIs may have arisen and accounts for both gene-unique reads and reads that multimap between genes. This addresses the inherent bias in existing tools which discard gene-ambiguous reads and improves the accuracy of gene abundance estimates. Alevin is considerably faster, typically eight times, than existing gene quantification approaches, while also using less memory.
41099696	2025	Nucleic acids research	GQ-DNABERT reveals GQ proximal enhancer-promoter interactions associated with tissue-specific transcription.	Alternative DNA conformation formed by sequences called flipons are thought to play an important role in regulating various genomic processes, either repressing or enhancing transcription, chromatin organization, DNA repair, telomere maintenance, RNA splicing, translation, and stress responses. The formation of G-quadruplexes (GQs) has been investigated experimentally using various methodologies with varying degrees of overlap between the results underscoring the need for a gold-standard GQ dataset. With this aim we trained a large language model, GQ-DNABERT using EndoQuad, the most comprehensive human GQ dataset. GQ-DNABERT recalled the training data and predicted de novo GQs in intergenic and intronic regions, enriched for cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) and ATAC-seq peaks. We evaluated the predicted GQ-DNABERT proximal enhancer-promoter (pEP) pairs, using annotations from ENdb, ENCODE, Zoonomia, Chromium multiomics scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq data from normal cells, and cCREs from normal-cancer pairs. We found GQ pEP pairs correlating with gene expression, with some pairings potentially acting as tissue-specific switches. Genes with GQ pEP pairs in cancer cells are enriched in different processes compared to the corresponding normal tissues. Overall, GQ-DNABERT is a valuable tool for extending and harmonizing data collected ex vivo. We demonstrate the usefulness of GQ-DNABERT for investigating transcriptional regulation in single-cell experiments.
29941873	2018	Nature methods	SAVER: gene expression recovery for single-cell RNA sequencing.	In single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) studies, only a small fraction of the transcripts present in each cell are sequenced. This leads to unreliable quantification of genes with low or moderate expression, which hinders downstream analysis. To address this challenge, we developed SAVER (single-cell analysis via expression recovery), an expression recovery method for unique molecule index (UMI)-based scRNA-seq data that borrows information across genes and cells to provide accurate expression estimates for all genes.
40495172	2025	Genome biology	TORC: Target-Oriented Reference Construction for supervised cell-type identification in scRNA-seq.	Cell-type identification is a crucial step in single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data analysis, for which supervised methods are preferred due to their accuracy and efficiency. Performance is highly dependent on the quality of the reference data, but there is no method for selecting and constructing reference data. We develop Target-Oriented Reference Construction (TORC), a widely applicable strategy for constructing reference data given a target dataset for scRNA-seq supervised cell-type identification. TORC alleviates the differences in data distribution and cell-type composition between reference and target. Extensive benchmarks on simulated and real data analyses demonstrate consistent improvements in cell-type identification from TORC.
34390351	2021	Nucleic acids research	Transposable element sequence fragments incorporated into coding and noncoding transcripts modulate the transcriptome of human pluripotent stem cells.	Transposable elements (TEs) occupy nearly 40% of mammalian genomes and, whilst most are fragmentary and no longer capable of transposition, they can nevertheless contribute to cell function. TEs within genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II can be copied as parts of primary transcripts; however, their full contribution to mature transcript sequences remains unresolved. Here, using long and short read (LR and SR) RNA sequencing data, we show that 26% of coding and 65% of noncoding transcripts in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) contain TE-derived sequences. Different TE families are incorporated into RNAs in unique patterns, with consequences to transcript structure and function. The presence of TE sequences within a transcript is correlated with TE-type specific changes in its subcellular distribution, alterations in steady-state levels and half-life, and differential association with RNA Binding Proteins (RBPs). We identify hPSC-specific incorporation of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) and LINE:L1 into protein-coding mRNAs, which generate TE sequence-derived peptides. Finally, single cell RNA-seq reveals that hPSCs express ERV-containing transcripts, whilst differentiating subpopulations lack ERVs and express SINE and LINE-containing transcripts. Overall, our comprehensive analysis demonstrates that the incorporation of TE sequences into the RNAs of hPSCs is more widespread and has a greater impact than previously appreciated.
36243975	2023	Nucleic acids research	SPASCER: spatial transcriptomics annotation at single-cell resolution.	In recent years, the explosive growth of spatial technologies has enabled the characterization of spatial heterogeneity of tissue architectures. Compared to traditional sequencing, spatial transcriptomics reserves the spatial information of each captured location and provides novel insights into diverse spatially related biological contexts. Even though two spatial transcriptomics databases exist, they provide limited analytical information. Information such as spatial heterogeneity of genes and cells, cell-cell communication activities in space, and the cell type compositions in the microenvironment are critical clues to unveil the mechanism of tumorigenesis and embryo differentiation. Therefore, we constructed a new spatial transcriptomics database, named SPASCER (https://ccsm.uth.edu/SPASCER), designed to help understand the heterogeneity of tissue organizations, region-specific microenvironment, and intercellular interactions across tissue architectures at multiple levels. SPASCER contains datasets from 43 studies, including 1082 sub-datasets from 16 organ types across four species. scRNA-seq was integrated to deconvolve/map spatial transcriptomics, and processed with spatial cell-cell interaction, gene pattern and pathway enrichment analysis. Cell-cell interactions and gene regulation network of scRNA-seq from matched spatial transcriptomics were performed as well. The application of SPASCER will provide new insights into tissue architecture and a solid foundation for the mechanistic understanding of many biological processes in healthy and diseased tissues.
36715275	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Denoising adaptive deep clustering with self-attention mechanism on single-cell sequencing data.	A large number of works have presented the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to study the diversity and biological functions of cells at the single-cell level. Clustering identifies unknown cell types, which is essential for downstream analysis of scRNA-seq samples. However, the high dimensionality, high noise and pervasive dropout rate of scRNA-seq samples have a significant challenge to the cluster analysis of scRNA-seq samples. Herein, we propose a new adaptive fuzzy clustering model based on the denoising autoencoder and self-attention mechanism called the scDASFK. It implements the comparative learning to integrate cell similar information into the clustering method and uses a deep denoising network module to denoise the data. scDASFK consists of a self-attention mechanism for further denoising where an adaptive clustering optimization function for iterative clustering is implemented. In order to make the denoised latent features better reflect the cell structure, we introduce a new adaptive feedback mechanism to supervise the denoising process through the clustering results. Experiments on 16 real scRNA-seq datasets show that scDASFK performs well in terms of clustering accuracy, scalability and stability. Overall, scDASFK is an effective clustering model with great potential for scRNA-seq samples analysis. Our scDASFK model codes are freely available at https://github.com/LRX2022/scDASFK.
40433981	2025	Nucleic acids research	SCIG: Machine learning uncovers cell identity genes in single cells by genetic sequence codes.	Deciphering cell identity genes is pivotal to understanding cell differentiation, development, and cell identity dysregulation involving diseases. Here, we introduce SCIG, a machine-learning method to uncover cell identity genes in single cells. In alignment with recent reports that cell identity genes (CIGs) are regulated with unique epigenetic signatures, we found CIGs exhibit distinctive genetic sequence signatures, e.g. unique enrichment patterns of cis-regulatory elements. Using these genetic sequence signatures, along with gene expression information from single-cell RNA-seq data, SCIG uncovers the identity genes of a cell without a need for comparison to other cells. CIG score defined by SCIG surpassed expression value in network analysis to reveal the master transcription factors (TFs) regulating cell identity. Applying SCIG to the human endothelial cell atlas revealed that the tissue microenvironment is a critical supplement to master TFs for cell identity refinement. SCIG is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14726426  , offering a valuable tool for advancing cell differentiation, development, and regenerative medicine research.
33876191	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	Deep learning of gene relationships from single cell time-course expression data.	Time-course gene-expression data have been widely used to infer regulatory and signaling relationships between genes. Most of the widely used methods for such analysis were developed for bulk expression data. Single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) data offer several advantages including the large number of expression profiles available and the ability to focus on individual cells rather than averages. However, the data also raise new computational challenges. Using a novel encoding for scRNA-Seq expression data, we develop deep learning methods for interaction prediction from time-course data. Our methods use a supervised framework which represents the data as 3D tensor and train convolutional and recurrent neural networks for predicting interactions. We tested our time-course deep learning (TDL) models on five different time-series scRNA-Seq datasets. As we show, TDL can accurately identify causal and regulatory gene-gene interactions and can also be used to assign new function to genes. TDL improves on prior methods for the above tasks and can be generally applied to new time-series scRNA-Seq data.
28665997	2017	PLoS computational biology	Independent regulation of gene expression level and noise by histone modifications.	"The inherent stochasticity generates substantial gene expression variation among isogenic cells under identical conditions, which is frequently referred to as gene expression noise or cell-to-cell expression variability. Similar to (average) expression level, expression noise is also subject to natural selection. Yet it has been observed that noise is negatively correlated with expression level, which manifests as a potential constraint for simultaneous optimization of both. Here, we studied expression noise in human embryonic cells with computational analysis on single-cell RNA-seq data and in yeast with flow cytometry experiments. We showed that this coupling is overcome, to a certain degree, by a histone modification strategy in multiple embryonic developmental stages in human, as well as in yeast. Importantly, this epigenetic strategy could fit into a burst-like gene expression model: promoter-localized histone modifications (such as H3K4 methylation) are associated with both burst size and burst frequency, which together influence expression level, while gene-body-localized ones (such as H3K79 methylation) are more associated with burst frequency, which influences both expression level and noise. We further knocked out the only ""writer"" of H3K79 methylation in yeast, and observed that expression noise is indeed increased. Consistently, dosage sensitive genes, such as genes in the Wnt signaling pathway, tend to be marked with gene-body-localized histone modifications, while stress responding genes, such as genes regulating autophagy, tend to be marked with promoter-localized ones. Our findings elucidate that the ""division of labor"" among histone modifications facilitates the independent regulation of expression level and noise, extend the ""histone code"" hypothesis to include expression noise, and shed light on the optimization of transcriptome in evolution."
36519825	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Pseudoalignment tools as an efficient alternative to detect repeated transposable elements in scRNAseq data.	MOTIVATION: Transposable elements (TE) have played a major role in configuring the structures of mammalian genomes through evolution. In normal conditions, the expression of these elements is repressed by different epigenetic regulation mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone modification and regulation by small RNAs. TE re-activation is associated with stemness potential acquisition, regulation of innate immunity and disease, such as cancer. However, the vast majority of current knowledge in the field is based on bulk expression studies, and very little is known on cell-type- or state-specific expression of TE-derived transcripts. Therefore, cost-efficient single-cell-resolution TE expression analytical approaches are needed. RESULTS: We have implemented an analytical approach based on pseudoalignment to consensus sequences to incorporate TE expression information to scRNAseq data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: All the data and code implemented are available as Supplementary data and in: https://github.com/jmzvillarreal/kallisto_TE_scRNAseq. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
41182817	2025	Nucleic acids research	DisCP-Atlas: a comprehensive resource mapping cellular processes to complex diseases.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of disease-associated loci, yet translating these findings into biological mechanisms remains challenging. Single-cell RNA-sequencing provides functional annotation at cellular resolution. Most current resources connect disease associations only to discrete cell-type categories. This cell type centric view overlooks disease-relevant cellular processes, which constitute the primary gene expression programs underlying genetic risk. These cellular processes function along continuous cell-state trajectories and routinely extend beyond conventional cell type boundaries. To address this issue, we present DisCP-Atlas (Disease to Cellular Process Atlas), a comprehensive resource that maps cellular processes to complex diseases. DisCP-Atlas identifies 990 cellular processes derived from 57 single-cell datasets across 35 human tissues, each annotated based on pathway enrichment and cell type-specific activities. Leveraging the sc-linker framework, we systematically linked 1072 GWAS datasets spanning 759 diseases to the cellular processes and identified 37 918 significant cellular process-disease associations. DisCP-Atlas allows bidirectional querying diseases to their underlying cellular processes or identifies diseases associated with specific cellular programs. All the results are presented in interactive visualization and can be conveniently downloaded. Additionally, DisCP-Atlas provides an online enrichment tool, enables users to submit custom genes, and returns detailed tables and interactive visualizations of enriched cellular processes. DisCP-Atlas is freely accessible at https://www.discpatlas.net.
37550579	2023	Nature methods	Isolating salient variations of interest in single-cell data with contrastiveVI.	Single-cell datasets are routinely collected to investigate changes in cellular state between control cells and the corresponding cells in a treatment condition, such as exposure to a drug or infection by a pathogen. To better understand heterogeneity in treatment response, it is desirable to deconvolve variations enriched in treated cells from those shared with controls. However, standard computational models of single-cell data are not designed to explicitly separate these variations. Here, we introduce contrastive variational inference (contrastiveVI; https://github.com/suinleelab/contrastiveVI ), a framework for deconvolving variations in treatment-control single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets into shared and treatment-specific latent variables. Using three treatment-control scRNA-seq datasets, we apply contrastiveVI to perform a variety of analysis tasks, including visualization, clustering and differential expression testing. We find that contrastiveVI consistently achieves results that agree with known ground truths and often highlights subtle phenomena that may be difficult to ascertain with standard workflows. We conclude by generalizing contrastiveVI to accommodate joint transcriptome and surface protein measurements.
27052890	2016	Genome biology	Design and computational analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing experiments.	Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a revolutionary tool that allows us to address scientific questions that eluded examination just a few years ago. With the advantages of scRNA-seq come computational challenges that are just beginning to be addressed. In this article, we highlight the computational methods available for the design and analysis of scRNA-seq experiments, their advantages and disadvantages in various settings, the open questions for which novel methods are needed, and expected future developments in this exciting area.
41066696	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Cell-type-specific cis-eQTLs in pancreatic cell types identify novel risk genes for type 2 diabetes.	Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex metabolic disorder strongly influenced by genetics. Most genetic studies, including expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses, use bulk pancreatic tissue, masking cell-specific mechanisms. Here, by integrating single-cell RNA sequencing, chromatin accessibility, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data, we systematically identified 328 pancreatic cell-type-specific cis-eQTLs associated with T2D. We pinpointed nine key genes (including STIL in beta and delta cells; ZSWIM5 in alpha, delta, and ductal cells; IL1RN, ANP32E, IPP, MLLT11, and SLC23A3 in delta cells; SNX4 in gamma cells; and RBMS1 in beta cells) whose SNPs overlapped with chromatin accessibility peaks. These genes highlight regulatory pathways in beta-cell dysfunction, metabolic stress responses, and disrupted pancreatic homeostasis. A public database, CTPeQTLs (https://ctpeqtls.netlify.app/), was developed to explore cis-eQTLs across diabetic and non-diabetic cohorts, revealing distinct regulatory patterns in both endocrine and exocrine cells, as well as disease-associated transcriptional dysregulation. Our findings uncover cell-specific genetic mechanisms in diabetes and provide potential therapeutic targets, supporting precision medicine strategies.
40315434	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Deep scSTAR: leveraging deep learning for the extraction and enhancement of phenotype-associated features from single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics data.	Single-cell sequencing has advanced our understanding of cellular heterogeneity and disease pathology, offering insights into cellular behavior and immune mechanisms. However, extracting meaningful phenotype-related features is challenging due to noise, batch effects, and irrelevant biological signals. To address this, we introduce Deep scSTAR (DscSTAR), a deep learning-based tool designed to enhance phenotype-associated features. DscSTAR identified HSP+ FKBP4+ T cells in CD8+ T cells, which linked to immune dysfunction and resistance to immune checkpoint blockade in non-small cell lung cancer. It has also enhanced spatial transcriptomics analysis of renal cell carcinoma, revealing interactions between cancer cells, CD8+ T cells, and tumor-associated macrophages that may promote immune suppression and affect outcomes. In hepatocellular carcinoma, it highlighted the role of S100A12+ neutrophils and cancer-associated fibroblasts in forming tumor immune barriers and potentially contributing to immunotherapy resistance. These findings demonstrate DscSTAR's capacity to model and extract phenotype-specific information, advancing our understanding of disease mechanisms and therapy resistance.
27165153	2016	Genome biology	Exploiting single-cell expression to characterize co-expression replicability.	BACKGROUND: Co-expression networks have been a useful tool for functional genomics, providing important clues about the cellular and biochemical mechanisms that are active in normal and disease processes. However, co-expression analysis is often treated as a black box with results being hard to trace to their basis in the data. Here, we use both published and novel single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data to understand fundamental drivers of gene-gene connectivity and replicability in co-expression networks. RESULTS: We perform the first major analysis of single-cell co-expression, sampling from 31 individual studies. Using neighbor voting in cross-validation, we find that single-cell network connectivity is less likely to overlap with known functions than co-expression derived from bulk data, with functional variation within cell types strongly resembling that also occurring across cell types. To identify features and analysis practices that contribute to this connectivity, we perform our own single-cell RNA-seq experiment of 126 cortical interneurons in an experimental design targeted to co-expression. By assessing network replicability, semantic similarity and overall functional connectivity, we identify technical factors influencing co-expression and suggest how they can be controlled for. Many of the technical effects we identify are expression-level dependent, making expression level itself highly predictive of network topology. We show this occurs generally through re-analysis of the BrainSpan RNA-seq data. CONCLUSIONS: Technical properties of single-cell RNA-seq data create confounds in co-expression networks which can be identified and explicitly controlled for in any supervised analysis. This is useful both in improving co-expression performance and in characterizing single-cell data in generally applicable terms, permitting cross-laboratory comparison within a common framework.
33010177	2021	Nucleic acids research	SC2disease: a manually curated database of single-cell transcriptome for human diseases.	SC2disease (http://easybioai.com/sc2disease/) is a manually curated database that aims to provide a comprehensive and accurate resource of gene expression profiles in various cell types for different diseases. With the development of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies, uncovering cellular heterogeneity of different tissues for different diseases has become feasible by profiling transcriptomes across cell types at the cellular level. In particular, comparing gene expression profiles between different cell types and identifying cell-type-specific genes in various diseases offers new possibilities to address biological and medical questions. However, systematic, hierarchical and vast databases of gene expression profiles in human diseases at the cellular level are lacking. Thus, we reviewed the literature prior to March 2020 for studies which used scRNA-seq to study diseases with human samples, and developed the SC2disease database to summarize all the data by different diseases, tissues and cell types. SC2disease documents 946 481 entries, corresponding to 341 cell types, 29 tissues and 25 diseases. Each entry in the SC2disease database contains comparisons of differentially expressed genes between different cell types, tissues and disease-related health status. Furthermore, we reanalyzed gene expression matrix by unified pipeline to improve the comparability between different studies. For each disease, we also compare cell-type-specific genes with the corresponding genes of lead single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to implicate cell type specificity of the traits.
36550277	2023	Nature methods	Efficient combinatorial targeting of RNA transcripts in single cells with Cas13 RNA Perturb-seq.	Pooled CRISPR screens coupled with single-cell RNA-sequencing have enabled systematic interrogation of gene function and regulatory networks. Here, we introduce Cas13 RNA Perturb-seq (CaRPool-seq), which leverages the RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas13d system and enables efficient combinatorial perturbations alongside multimodal single-cell profiling. CaRPool-seq encodes multiple perturbations on a cleavable CRISPR array that is associated with a detectable barcode sequence, allowing for the simultaneous targeting of multiple genes. We compared CaRPool-seq to existing Cas9-based methods, highlighting its unique strength to efficiently profile combinatorially perturbed cells. Finally, we apply CaRPool-seq to perform multiplexed combinatorial perturbations of myeloid differentiation regulators in an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) model system and identify extensive interactions between different chromatin regulators that can enhance or suppress AML differentiation phenotypes.
33627473	2021	Genome research	Linear-time cluster ensembles of large-scale single-cell RNA-seq and multimodal data.	A fundamental task in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) analysis is the identification of transcriptionally distinct groups of cells. Numerous methods have been proposed for this problem, with a recent focus on methods for the cluster analysis of ultralarge scRNA-seq data sets produced by droplet-based sequencing technologies. Most existing methods rely on a sampling step to bridge the gap between algorithm scalability and volume of the data. Ignoring large parts of the data, however, often yields inaccurate groupings of cells and risks overlooking rare cell types. We propose method Specter that adopts and extends recent algorithmic advances in (fast) spectral clustering. In contrast to methods that cluster a (random) subsample of the data, we adopt the idea of landmarks that are used to create a sparse representation of the full data from which a spectral embedding can then be computed in linear time. We exploit Specter's speed in a cluster ensemble scheme that achieves a substantial improvement in accuracy over existing methods and identifies rare cell types with high sensitivity. Its linear-time complexity allows Specter to scale to millions of cells and leads to fast computation times in practice. Furthermore, on CITE-seq data that simultaneously measures gene and protein marker expression, we show that Specter is able to use multimodal omics measurements to resolve subtle transcriptomic differences between subpopulations of cells.
34404460	2021	Genome biology	CoCoA-diff: counterfactual inference for single-cell gene expression analysis.	Finding a causal gene is a fundamental problem in genomic medicine. We present a causal inference framework, CoCoA-diff, that prioritizes disease genes by adjusting confounders without prior knowledge of control variables in single-cell RNA-seq data. We demonstrate that our method substantially improves statistical power in simulations and real-world data analysis of 70k brain cells collected for dissecting Alzheimer's disease. We identify 215 differentially regulated causal genes in various cell types, including highly relevant genes with a proper cell type context. Genes found in different types enrich distinctive pathways, implicating the importance of cell types in understanding multifaceted disease mechanisms.
36918913	2023	Genome biology	Cell-specific clock-controlled gene expression program regulates rhythmic fiber cell growth in cotton.	BACKGROUND: The epidermis of cotton ovule produces fibers, the most important natural cellulose source for the global textile industry. However, the molecular mechanism of fiber cell growth is still poorly understood. RESULTS: Here, we develop an optimized protoplasting method, and integrate single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) to systematically characterize the cells of the outer integument of ovules from wild type and fuzzless/lintless (fl) cotton (Gossypium hirsutum). By jointly analyzing the scRNA-seq data from wildtype and fl, we identify five cell populations including the fiber cell type and construct the development trajectory for fiber lineage cells. Interestingly, by time-course diurnal transcriptomic analysis, we demonstrate that the primary growth of fiber cells is a highly regulated circadian rhythmic process. Moreover, we identify a small peptide GhRALF1 that circadian rhythmically controls fiber growth possibly through oscillating auxin signaling and proton pump activity in the plasma membrane. Combining with scATAC-seq, we further identify two cardinal cis-regulatory elements (CREs, TCP motif, and TCP-like motif) which are bound by the trans factors GhTCP14s to modulate the circadian rhythmic metabolism of mitochondria and protein translation through regulating approximately one third of genes that are highly expressed in fiber cells. CONCLUSIONS: We uncover a fiber-specific circadian clock-controlled gene expression program in regulating fiber growth. This study unprecedentedly reveals a new route to improve fiber traits by engineering the circadian clock of fiber cells.
39494521	2024	Nucleic acids research	Recruitment of homodimeric proneural factors by conserved CAT-CAT E-boxes drives major epigenetic reconfiguration in cortical neurogenesis.	Proneural factors of the basic helix-loop-helix family coordinate neurogenesis and neurodifferentiation. Among them, NEUROG2 and NEUROD2 subsequently act to specify neurons of the glutamatergic lineage. Disruption of these factors, their target genes and binding DNA motifs has been linked to various neuropsychiatric disorders. Proneural factors bind to specific DNA motifs called E-boxes (hexanucleotides of the form CANNTG, composed of two CAN half sites on opposed strands). While corticogenesis heavily relies on E-box activity, the collaboration of proneural factors on different E-box types and their chromatin remodeling mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we conducted a comprehensive analysis using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) data for NEUROG2 and NEUROD2, along with time-matched single-cell RNA-seq, ATAC-seq and DNA methylation data from the developing mouse cortex. Our findings show that these factors are highly enriched in transiently active genomic regions during intermediate stages of neuronal differentiation. Although they primarily bind CAG-containing E-boxes, their binding in dynamic regions is notably enriched in CAT-CAT E-boxes (i.e. CATATG, denoted as 5'3' half sites for dimers), which undergo significant DNA demethylation and exhibit the highest levels of evolutionary constraint. Aided by HT-SELEX data reanalysis, structural modeling and DNA footprinting, we propose that these proneural factors exert maximal chromatin remodeling influence during intermediate stages of neurogenesis by binding as homodimers to CAT-CAT motifs. This study provides an in-depth integrative analysis of the dynamic regulation of E-boxes during neuronal development, enhancing our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the binding specificity of critical proneural factors.
40609069	2025	PLoS computational biology	Understanding disease-associated metabolic changes in human colonic epithelial cells using the iColonEpithelium metabolic reconstruction.	The colonic epithelium plays a key role in the host-microbiome interactions, allowing uptake of various nutrients and driving important metabolic processes. To unravel detailed metabolic activities in the human colonic epithelium, our present study focuses on the generation of the first cell-type-specific genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) of human colonic epithelial cells, named iColonEpithelium. GEMs are powerful tools for exploring reactions and metabolites at the systems level and predicting the flux distributions at steady state. Our cell-type-specific iColonEpithelium metabolic reconstruction captures genes specifically expressed in the human colonic epithelial cells. iColonEpithelium is also capable of performing metabolic tasks specific to the colonic epithelium. A unique transport reaction compartment has been included to allow for the simulation of metabolic interactions with the gut microbiome. We used iColonEpithelium to identify metabolic signatures associated with inflammatory bowel disease. We used single-cell RNA sequencing data from Crohn's Diseases (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) samples to build disease-specific iColonEpithelium metabolic networks in order to predict metabolic signatures of colonocytes in both healthy and disease states. We identified reactions in nucleotide interconversion, fatty acid synthesis and tryptophan metabolism were differentially regulated in CD and UC conditions, relative to healthy control, which were in accordance with experimental results. The iColonEpithelium metabolic network can be used to identify mechanisms at the cellular level, and we show an initial proof-of-concept for how our tool can be leveraged to explore the metabolic interactions between host and gut microbiota.
40713795	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Spatial mutual nearest neighbors for spatial transcriptomics data.	MOTIVATION: Mutual nearest neighbors (MNN) is a widely used computational tool to perform batch correction for single-cell RNA-sequencing data. However, in applications such as spatial transcriptomics, it fails to take into account the 2D spatial information. RESULTS: Here, we present spatialMNN, an algorithm that integrates multiple spatial transcriptomic samples and identifies spatial domains. Our approach begins by building a k-nearest neighbors (kNN) graph based on the spatial coordinates, prunes noisy edges, and identifies niches to act as anchor points for each sample. Next, we construct a MNN graph across the samples to identify similar niches. Finally, the spatialMNN graph can be partitioned using existing algorithms, such as the Louvain algorithm to predict spatial domains across the tissue samples. We demonstrate the performance of spatialMNN using large datasets, including one with N = 31 10x Genomics Visium samples. We also evaluate the computing performance of spatialMNN to other popular spatial clustering methods. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Our software package is available on GitHub (https://github.com/Pixel-Dream/spatialMNN). The code is available on Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15073963).
31175825	2019	Nucleic acids research	Learning common and specific patterns from data of multiple interrelated biological scenarios with matrix factorization.	High-throughput biological technologies (e.g. ChIP-seq, RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq) rapidly accelerate the accumulation of genome-wide omics data in diverse interrelated biological scenarios (e.g. cells, tissues and conditions). Integration and differential analysis are two common paradigms for exploring and analyzing such data. However, current integrative methods usually ignore the differential part, and typical differential analysis methods either fail to identify combinatorial patterns of difference or require matched dimensions of the data. Here, we propose a flexible framework CSMF to combine them into one paradigm to simultaneously reveal Common and Specific patterns via Matrix Factorization from data generated under interrelated biological scenarios. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CSMF with four representative applications including pairwise ChIP-seq data describing the chromatin modification map between K562 and Huvec cell lines; pairwise RNA-seq data representing the expression profiles of two different cancers; RNA-seq data of three breast cancer subtypes; and single-cell RNA-seq data of human embryonic stem cell differentiation at six time points. Extensive analysis yields novel insights into hidden combinatorial patterns in these multi-modal data. Results demonstrate that CSMF is a powerful tool to uncover common and specific patterns with significant biological implications from data of interrelated biological scenarios.
34146085	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Normalization by distributional resampling of high throughput single-cell RNA-sequencing data.	MOTIVATION: Normalization to remove technical or experimental artifacts is critical in the analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing experiments, even those for which unique molecular identifiers are available. The majority of methods for normalizing single-cell RNA-sequencing data adjust average expression for library size (LS), allowing the variance and other properties of the gene-specific expression distribution to be non-constant in LS. This often results in reduced power and increased false discoveries in downstream analyses, a problem which is exacerbated by the high proportion of zeros present in most datasets. RESULTS: To address this, we present Dino, a normalization method based on a flexible negative-binomial mixture model of gene expression. As demonstrated in both simulated and case study datasets, by normalizing the entire gene expression distribution, Dino is robust to shallow sequencing, sample heterogeneity and varying zero proportions, leading to improved performance in downstream analyses in a number of settings. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The R package, Dino, is available on GitHub at https://github.com/JBrownBiostat/Dino. The Dino package is further archived and freely available on Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4897558. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
39494524	2025	Nucleic acids research	scImmOmics: a manually curated resource of single-cell multi-omics immune data.	Single-cell sequencing technology has enabled the discovery and characterization of subpopulations of immune cells with unique functions, which is critical for revealing immune responses under healthy or disease conditions. Efforts have been made to collect and curate single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, yet an immune-specific single-cell multi-omics atlas with harmonized metadata is still lacking. Here, we present scImmOmics (https://bio.liclab.net/scImmOmics/home), a manually curated single-cell multi-omics immune database constructed based on high-quality immune cells with known immune cell labels. Currently, scImmOmics documents >2.9 million cell-type labeled immune cells derived from seven single-cell sequencing technologies, involving 131 immune cell types, 47 tissues and 4 species. To ensure data consistency, we standardized the nomenclature of immune cell types and presented them in a hierarchical tree structure to clearly describe the lineage relationships within the immune system. scImmOmics also provides comprehensive immune regulatory information, including T-cell/B-cell receptor sequencing clonotype information, cell-specific regulatory information (e.g. gene/chromatin accessibility/protein/transcription factor states within known cell types, cell-to-cell communication and co-expression networks) and immune cell responses to cytokines. Collectively, scImmOmics is a comprehensive and valuable platform for unraveling the heterogeneity and diversity of immune cells and elucidating the specific regulatory mechanisms at the single-cell level.
38831386	2024	Genome biology	Systematic evaluation with practical guidelines for single-cell and spatially resolved transcriptomics data simulation under multiple scenarios.	BACKGROUND: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) have led to groundbreaking advancements in life sciences. To develop bioinformatics tools for scRNA-seq and SRT data and perform unbiased benchmarks, data simulation has been widely adopted by providing explicit ground truth and generating customized datasets. However, the performance of simulation methods under multiple scenarios has not been comprehensively assessed, making it challenging to choose suitable methods without practical guidelines. RESULTS: We systematically evaluated 49 simulation methods developed for scRNA-seq and/or SRT data in terms of accuracy, functionality, scalability, and usability using 152 reference datasets derived from 24 platforms. SRTsim, scDesign3, ZINB-WaVE, and scDesign2 have the best accuracy performance across various platforms. Unexpectedly, some methods tailored to scRNA-seq data have potential compatibility for simulating SRT data. Lun, SPARSim, and scDesign3-tree outperform other methods under corresponding simulation scenarios. Phenopath, Lun, Simple, and MFA yield high scalability scores but they cannot generate realistic simulated data. Users should consider the trade-offs between method accuracy and scalability (or functionality) when making decisions. Additionally, execution errors are mainly caused by failed parameter estimations and appearance of missing or infinite values in calculations. We provide practical guidelines for method selection, a standard pipeline Simpipe ( https://github.com/duohongrui/simpipe ; https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11178409 ), and an online tool Simsite ( https://www.ciblab.net/software/simshiny/ ) for data simulation. CONCLUSIONS: No method performs best on all criteria, thus a good-yet-not-the-best method is recommended if it solves problems effectively and reasonably. Our comprehensive work provides crucial insights for developers on modeling gene expression data and fosters the simulation process for users.
35901457	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	GE-Impute: graph embedding-based imputation for single-cell RNA-seq data.	Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been widely used to depict gene expression profiles at the single-cell resolution. However, its relatively high dropout rate often results in artificial zero expressions of genes and therefore compromised reliability of results. To overcome such unwanted sparsity of scRNA-seq data, several imputation algorithms have been developed to recover the single-cell expression profiles. Here, we propose a novel approach, GE-Impute, to impute the dropout zeros in scRNA-seq data with graph embedding-based neural network model. GE-Impute learns the neural graph representation for each cell and reconstructs the cell-cell similarity network accordingly, which enables better imputation of dropout zeros based on the more accurately allocated neighbors in the similarity network. Gene expression correlation analysis between true expression data and simulated dropout data suggests significantly better performance of GE-Impute on recovering dropout zeros for both droplet- and plated-based scRNA-seq data. GE-Impute also outperforms other imputation methods in identifying differentially expressed genes and improving the unsupervised clustering on datasets from various scRNA-seq techniques. Moreover, GE-Impute enhances the identification of marker genes, facilitating the cell type assignment of clusters. In trajectory analysis, GE-Impute improves time-course scRNA-seq data analysis and reconstructing differentiation trajectory. The above results together demonstrate that GE-Impute could be a useful method to recover the single-cell expression profiles, thus enabling better biological interpretation of scRNA-seq data. GE-Impute is implemented in Python and is freely available at https://github.com/wxbCaterpillar/GE-Impute.
41097818	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	PILOT-GM-VAE: patient-level analysis of single-cell disease atlas with optimal transport of Gaussian mixture variational autoencoders.	The analysis of single-cell disease atlases represents a challenge due to the presence of batch effects, low quality of disease samples, and the multiscale nature of the data, i.e. samples are described by different cell distributions. Because of these, few computational approaches are performing sample-level disease progression analysis so far. Here, we introduce Patient-Level Analysis with Optimal Transport based on Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoders (PILOT-GM-VAE). PILOT-GM-VAE explores the power of GM-VAE to estimate models describing complex single-cell distributions through efficient optimal transport algorithms for estimating the distance between Gaussian Mixtures. Extensive benchmarking on 12 single-cell disease atlases and competing approaches demonstrate the performance of PILOT-GM-VAE in sample-level clustering, sample-level trajectory inference, and batch correction tasks. Moreover, we performed a case study on a breast cancer disease atlas, where PILOT-GM-VAE highlighted cellular and molecular changes associated with breast cancer disease progression.
30818329	2019	PLoS computational biology	Integration of single-cell RNA-seq data into population models to characterize cancer metabolism.	Metabolic reprogramming is a general feature of cancer cells. Regrettably, the comprehensive quantification of metabolites in biological specimens does not promptly translate into knowledge on the utilization of metabolic pathways. By estimating fluxes across metabolic pathways, computational models hold the promise to bridge this gap between data and biological functionality. These models currently portray the average behavior of cell populations however, masking the inherent heterogeneity that is part and parcel of tumorigenesis as much as drug resistance. To remove this limitation, we propose single-cell Flux Balance Analysis (scFBA) as a computational framework to translate single-cell transcriptomes into single-cell fluxomes. We show that the integration of single-cell RNA-seq profiles of cells derived from lung adenocarcinoma and breast cancer patients into a multi-scale stoichiometric model of a cancer cell population: significantly 1) reduces the space of feasible single-cell fluxomes; 2) allows to identify clusters of cells with different growth rates within the population; 3) points out the possible metabolic interactions among cells via exchange of metabolites. The scFBA suite of MATLAB functions is available at https://github.com/BIMIB-DISCo/scFBA, as well as the case study datasets.
38658646	2024	Nature methods	De novo identification of CD4(+) T cell epitopes.	CD4(+) T cells recognize peptide antigens presented on class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC-II) molecules to carry out their function. The remarkable diversity of T cell receptor sequences and lack of antigen discovery approaches for MHC-II make profiling the specificities of CD4(+) T cells challenging. We have expanded our platform of signaling and antigen-presenting bifunctional receptors to encode MHC-II molecules presenting covalently linked peptides (SABR-IIs) for CD4(+) T cell antigen discovery. SABR-IIs can present epitopes to CD4(+) T cells and induce signaling upon their recognition, allowing a readable output. Furthermore, the SABR-II design is modular in signaling and deployment to T cells and B cells. Here, we demonstrate that SABR-IIs libraries presenting endogenous and non-contiguous epitopes can be used for antigen discovery in the context of type 1 diabetes. SABR-II libraries provide a rapid, flexible, scalable and versatile approach for de novo identification of CD4(+) T cell ligands from single-cell RNA sequencing data using experimental and computational approaches.
36809239	2023	PLoS computational biology	Phenotypic pliancy and the breakdown of epigenetic polycomb mechanisms.	Epigenetic regulatory mechanisms allow multicellular organisms to develop distinct specialized cell identities despite having the same total genome. Cell-fate choices are based on gene expression programs and environmental cues that cells experience during embryonic development, and are usually maintained throughout the life of the organism despite new environmental cues. The evolutionarily conserved Polycomb group (PcG) proteins form Polycomb Repressive Complexes that help orchestrate these developmental choices. Post-development, these complexes actively maintain the resulting cell fate, even in the face of environmental perturbations. Given the crucial role of these polycomb mechanisms in providing phenotypic fidelity (i.e. maintenance of cell fate), we hypothesize that their dysregulation after development will lead to decreased phenotypic fidelity allowing dysregulated cells to sustainably switch their phenotype in response to environmental changes. We call this abnormal phenotypic switching phenotypic pliancy. We introduce a general computational evolutionary model that allows us to test our systems-level phenotypic pliancy hypothesis in-silico and in a context-independent manner. We find that 1) phenotypic fidelity is an emergent systems-level property of PcG-like mechanism evolution, and 2) phenotypic pliancy is an emergent systems-level property resulting from this mechanism's dysregulation. Since there is evidence that metastatic cells behave in a phenotypically pliant manner, we hypothesize that progression to metastasis is driven by the emergence of phenotypic pliancy in cancer cells as a result of PcG mechanism dysregulation. We corroborate our hypothesis using single-cell RNA-sequencing data from metastatic cancers. We find that metastatic cancer cells are phenotypically pliant in the same manner as predicted by our model.
26689543	2016	Nature biotechnology	Electrophysiological, transcriptomic and morphologic profiling of single neurons using Patch-seq.	Despite the importance of the mammalian neocortex for complex cognitive processes, we still lack a comprehensive description of its cellular components. To improve the classification of neuronal cell types and the functional characterization of single neurons, we present Patch-seq, a method that combines whole-cell electrophysiological patch-clamp recordings, single-cell RNA-sequencing and morphological characterization. Following electrophysiological characterization, cell contents are aspirated through the patch-clamp pipette and prepared for RNA-sequencing. Using this approach, we generate electrophysiological and molecular profiles of 58 neocortical cells and show that gene expression patterns can be used to infer the morphological and physiological properties such as axonal arborization and action potential amplitude of individual neurons. Our results shed light on the molecular underpinnings of neuronal diversity and suggest that Patch-seq can facilitate the classification of cell types in the nervous system.
29723188	2018	PLoS computational biology	beachmat: A Bioconductor C++ API for accessing high-throughput biological data from a variety of R matrix types.	Biological experiments involving genomics or other high-throughput assays typically yield a data matrix that can be explored and analyzed using the R programming language with packages from the Bioconductor project. Improvements in the throughput of these assays have resulted in an explosion of data even from routine experiments, which poses a challenge to the existing computational infrastructure for statistical data analysis. For example, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiments frequently generate large matrices containing expression values for each gene in each cell, requiring sparse or file-backed representations for memory-efficient manipulation in R. These alternative representations are not easily compatible with high-performance C++ code used for computationally intensive tasks in existing R/Bioconductor packages. Here, we describe a C++ interface named beachmat, which enables agnostic data access from various matrix representations. This allows package developers to write efficient C++ code that is interoperable with dense, sparse and file-backed matrices, amongst others. We evaluated the performance of beachmat for accessing data from each matrix representation using both simulated and real scRNA-seq data, and defined a clear memory/speed trade-off to motivate the choice of an appropriate representation. We also demonstrate how beachmat can be incorporated into the code of other packages to drive analyses of a very large scRNA-seq data set.
31400192	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Using multiple measurements of tissue to estimate subject- and cell-type-specific gene expression.	MOTIVATION: Patterns of gene expression, quantified at the level of tissue or cells, can inform on etiology of disease. There are now rich resources for tissue-level (bulk) gene expression data, which have been collected from thousands of subjects, and resources involving single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data are expanding rapidly. The latter yields cell type information, although the data can be noisy and typically are derived from a small number of subjects. RESULTS: Complementing these approaches, we develop a method to estimate subject- and cell-type-specific (CTS) gene expression from tissue using an empirical Bayes method that borrows information across multiple measurements of the same tissue per subject (e.g. multiple regions of the brain). Analyzing expression data from multiple brain regions from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx) reveals CTS expression, which then permits downstream analyses, such as identification of CTS expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL). AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: We implement this method as an R package MIND, hosted on https://github.com/randel/MIND. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
35758781	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	psupertime: supervised pseudotime analysis for time-series single-cell RNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: Improvements in single-cell RNA-seq technologies mean that studies measuring multiple experimental conditions, such as time series, have become more common. At present, few computational methods exist to infer time series-specific transcriptome changes, and such studies have therefore typically used unsupervised pseudotime methods. While these methods identify cell subpopulations and the transitions between them, they are not appropriate for identifying the genes that vary coherently along the time series. In addition, the orderings they estimate are based only on the major sources of variation in the data, which may not correspond to the processes related to the time labels. RESULTS: We introduce psupertime, a supervised pseudotime approach based on a regression model, which explicitly uses time-series labels as input. It identifies genes that vary coherently along a time series, in addition to pseudotime values for individual cells, and a classifier that can be used to estimate labels for new data with unknown or differing labels. We show that psupertime outperforms benchmark classifiers in terms of identifying time-varying genes and provides better individual cell orderings than popular unsupervised pseudotime techniques. psupertime is applicable to any single-cell RNA-seq dataset with sequential labels (e.g. principally time series but also drug dosage and disease progression), derived from either experimental design and provides a fast, interpretable tool for targeted identification of genes varying along with specific biological processes. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: R package available at github.com/wmacnair/psupertime and code for results reproduction at github.com/wmacnair/psupplementary. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
38801700	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	irGSEA: the integration of single-cell rank-based gene set enrichment analysis.	irGSEA is an R package designed to assess the outcomes of various gene set scoring methods when applied to single-cell RNA sequencing data. This package incorporates six distinct scoring methods that rely on the expression ranks of genes, emphasizing relative expression levels over absolute values. The implemented methods include AUCell, UCell, singscore, ssGSEA, JASMINE and Viper. Previous studies have demonstrated the robustness of these methods to variations in dataset size and composition, generating enrichment scores based solely on the relative gene expression of individual cells. By employing the robust rank aggregation algorithm, irGSEA amalgamates results from all six methods to ascertain the statistical significance of target gene sets across diverse scoring methods. The package prioritizes user-friendliness, allowing direct input of expression matrices or seamless interaction with Seurat objects. Furthermore, it facilitates a comprehensive visualization of results. The irGSEA package and its accompanying documentation are accessible on GitHub (https://github.com/chuiqin/irGSEA).
31836005	2019	Genome biology	Vireo: Bayesian demultiplexing of pooled single-cell RNA-seq data without genotype reference.	Multiplexed single-cell RNA-seq analysis of multiple samples using pooling is a promising experimental design, offering increased throughput while allowing to overcome batch variation. To reconstruct the sample identify of each cell, genetic variants that segregate between the samples in the pool have been proposed as natural barcode for cell demultiplexing. Existing demultiplexing strategies rely on availability of complete genotype data from the pooled samples, which limits the applicability of such methods, in particular when genetic variation is not the primary object of study. To address this, we here present Vireo, a computationally efficient Bayesian model to demultiplex single-cell data from pooled experimental designs. Uniquely, our model can be applied in settings when only partial or no genotype information is available. Using pools based on synthetic mixtures and results on real data, we demonstrate the robustness of Vireo and illustrate the utility of multiplexed experimental designs for common expression analyses.
39778870	2025	Nucleic acids research	Benchmarking cross-species single-cell RNA-seq data integration methods: towards a cell type tree of life.	Cross-species single-cell RNA-seq data hold immense potential for unraveling cell type evolution and transferring knowledge between well-explored and less-studied species. However, challenges arise from interspecific genetic variation, batch effects stemming from experimental discrepancies and inherent individual biological differences. Here, we benchmarked nine data-integration methods across 20 species, encompassing 4.7 million cells, spanning eight phyla and the entire animal taxonomic hierarchy. Our evaluation reveals notable differences between the methods in removing batch effects and preserving biological variance across taxonomic distances. Methods that effectively leverage gene sequence information capture underlying biological variances, while generative model-based approaches excel in batch effect removal. SATURN demonstrates robust performance across diverse taxonomic levels, from cross-genus to cross-phylum, emphasizing its versatility. SAMap excels in integrating species beyond the cross-family level, especially for atlas-level cross-species integration, while scGen shines within or below the cross-class hierarchy. As a result, our analysis offers recommendations and guidelines for selecting suitable integration methods, enhancing cross-species single-cell RNA-seq analyses and advancing algorithm development.

37080771	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	TripletCell: a deep metric learning framework for accurate annotation of cell types at the single-cell level.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has significantly accelerated the experimental characterization of distinct cell lineages and types in complex tissues and organisms. Cell-type annotation is of great importance in most of the scRNA-seq analysis pipelines. However, manual cell-type annotation heavily relies on the quality of scRNA-seq data and marker genes, and therefore can be laborious and time-consuming. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of scRNA-seq datasets poses another challenge for accurate cell-type annotation, such as the batch effect induced by different scRNA-seq protocols and samples. To overcome these limitations, here we propose a novel pipeline, termed TripletCell, for cross-species, cross-protocol and cross-sample cell-type annotation. We developed a cell embedding and dimension-reduction module for the feature extraction (FE) in TripletCell, namely TripletCell-FE, to leverage the deep metric learning-based algorithm for the relationships between the reference gene expression matrix and the query cells. Our experimental studies on 21 datasets (covering nine scRNA-seq protocols, two species and three tissues) demonstrate that TripletCell outperformed state-of-the-art approaches for cell-type annotation. More importantly, regardless of protocols or species, TripletCell can deliver outstanding and robust performance in annotating different types of cells. TripletCell is freely available at https://github.com/liuyan3056/TripletCell. We believe that TripletCell is a reliable computational tool for accurately annotating various cell types using scRNA-seq data and will be instrumental in assisting the generation of novel biological hypotheses in cell biology.
39999031	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Scupa: single-cell unified polarization assessment of immune cells using the single-cell foundation model.	MOTIVATION: Immune cells undergo cytokine-driven polarization in response to diverse stimuli, altering their transcriptional profiles and functional states. This dynamic process is central to immune responses in health and diseases, yet a systematic approach to assess cytokine-driven polarization in single-cell RNA sequencing data has been lacking. RESULTS: To address this gap, we developed single-cell unified polarization assessment (Scupa), the first computational method for comprehensive immune cell polarization assessment. Scupa leverages data from the Immune Dictionary, which characterizes cytokine-driven polarization states across 14 immune cell types. By integrating cell embeddings from the single-cell foundation model Universal Cell Embeddings, Scupa effectively identifies polarized cells across different species and experimental conditions. Applications of Scupa in independent datasets demonstrated its accuracy in classifying polarized cells and further revealed distinct polarization profiles in tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells across cancers. Scupa complements conventional single-cell data analysis by providing new insights into dynamic immune cell states, and holds potential for advancing therapeutic insights, particularly in cytokine-based therapies. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The code is available at https://github.com/bsml320/Scupa.
35658001	2022	PLoS computational biology	scAmpi-A versatile pipeline for single-cell RNA-seq analysis from basics to clinics.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful technique to decipher tissue composition at the single-cell level and to inform on disease mechanisms, tumor heterogeneity, and the state of the immune microenvironment. Although multiple methods for the computational analysis of scRNA-seq data exist, their application in a clinical setting demands standardized and reproducible workflows, targeted to extract, condense, and display the clinically relevant information. To this end, we designed scAmpi (Single Cell Analysis mRNA pipeline), a workflow that facilitates scRNA-seq analysis from raw read processing to informing on sample composition, clinically relevant gene and pathway alterations, and in silico identification of personalized candidate drug treatments. We demonstrate the value of this workflow for clinical decision making in a molecular tumor board as part of a clinical study.
26743507	2016	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	OEFinder: a user interface to identify and visualize ordering effects in single-cell RNA-seq data.	A recent article identified an artifact in multiple single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) datasets generated by the Fluidigm C1 platform. Specifically, Leng et al. showed significantly increased gene expression in cells captured from sites with small or large plate output IDs. We refer to this artifact as an ordering effect (OE). Including OE genes in downstream analyses could lead to biased results. To address this problem, we developed a statistical method and software called OEFinder to identify a sorted list of OE genes. OEFinder is available as an R package along with user-friendly graphical interface implementations which allows users to check for potential artifacts in scRNA-seq data generated by the Fluidigm C1 platform.

38221903	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	scFed: federated learning for cell type classification with scRNA-seq.	The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity and complexity in biological tissues. However, the nature of large, sparse scRNA-seq datasets and privacy regulations present challenges for efficient cell identification. Federated learning provides a solution, allowing efficient and private data use. Here, we introduce scFed, a unified federated learning framework that allows for benchmarking of four classification algorithms without violating data privacy, including single-cell-specific and general-purpose classifiers. We evaluated scFed using eight publicly available scRNA-seq datasets with diverse sizes, species and technologies, assessing its performance via intra-dataset and inter-dataset experimental setups. We find that scFed performs well on a variety of datasets with competitive accuracy to centralized models. Though Transformer-based model excels in centralized training, its performance slightly lags behind single-cell-specific model within the scFed framework, coupled with a notable time complexity concern. Our study not only helps select suitable cell identification methods but also highlights federated learning's potential for privacy-preserving, collaborative biomedical research.
36253828	2022	Genome biology	Normalization and de-noising of single-cell Hi-C data with BandNorm and scVI-3D.	Single-cell high-throughput chromatin conformation capture methodologies (scHi-C) enable profiling of long-range genomic interactions. However, data from these technologies are prone to technical noise and biases that hinder downstream analysis. We develop a normalization approach, BandNorm, and a deep generative modeling framework, scVI-3D, to account for scHi-C specific biases. In benchmarking experiments, BandNorm yields leading performances in a time and memory efficient manner for cell-type separation, identification of interacting loci, and recovery of cell-type relationships, while scVI-3D exhibits advantages for rare cell types and under high sparsity scenarios. Application of BandNorm coupled with gene-associating domain analysis reveals scRNA-seq validated sub-cell type identification.
25053837	2014	Nucleic acids research	Single-cell RNA-seq: advances and future challenges.	Phenotypically identical cells can dramatically vary with respect to behavior during their lifespan and this variation is reflected in their molecular composition such as the transcriptomic landscape. Single-cell transcriptomics using next-generation transcript sequencing (RNA-seq) is now emerging as a powerful tool to profile cell-to-cell variability on a genomic scale. Its application has already greatly impacted our conceptual understanding of diverse biological processes with broad implications for both basic and clinical research. Different single-cell RNA-seq protocols have been introduced and are reviewed here-each one with its own strengths and current limitations. We further provide an overview of the biological questions single-cell RNA-seq has been used to address, the major findings obtained from such studies, and current challenges and expected future developments in this booming field.
40971965	2025	PLoS computational biology	Mouse-Specific Single cell cytokine activity prediction and Estimation (MouSSE).	The accurate cell-level characterization of cytokine activity is important for understanding the signaling processes underpinning a wide range of immune-mediated conditions such as auto-immune disease, cancer and response to infection. We previously proposed the SCAPE (Single cell transcriptomics-level Cytokine Activity Prediction and Estimation) method to address the challenges associated with cytokine activity estimation in human single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics (ST) data. Here, we propose a new method MouSSE (Mouse-Specific Single cell transcriptomics level cytokine activity prediction and Estimation) for performing cytokine activity estimation in murine scRNA-seq and ST data. MouSSE estimates the cell-level activity of 86 distinct cytokines using a gene set scoring approach. The cytokine-specific gene sets used by MouSSE are constructed using experimental cytokine stimulation data from the Immune Dictionary and cell-level scores are computed using a modification of the Variance-adjusted Mahalanobis (VAM) technique that supports both positive and negative gene weights. MouSSE is validated using data from both the Immune Dictionary via stratified cross-validation and external scRNA-seq and ST datasets against 10 cytokine activity estimation methods. These results demonstrate that MouSSE outperforms comparable methods for cell-level cytokine activity estimation in mouse scRNA-seq and ST data. An example vignette and installation instructions for the MouSSE R package are provided at https://github.com/azkajavaid/MousseR-package.
40650988	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	SCassist: an AI based workflow assistant for single-cell analysis.	SUMMARY: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis often involves complex iterative workflow, requiring significant expertise and time. To navigate this complexity, we have developed SCassist, an R package that leverages the power of the large language models (LLM's) to guide and enhance scRNA-seq analysis. SCassist integrates LLM's into key workflow steps, to analyze user data and provide relevant recommendations for filtering, normalization and clustering parameters. It also provides LLM guided insightful interpretations of variable features and principal components, along with cell type annotations and enrichment analysis. SCassist provides intelligent assistance using popular LLM's like Google's Gemini, OpenAI's GPT and Meta's Llama3, making scRNA-seq analysis accessible to researchers at all levels.

29608555	2018	Nature methods	scmap: projection of single-cell RNA-seq data across data sets.	Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) allows researchers to define cell types on the basis of unsupervised clustering of the transcriptome. However, differences in experimental methods and computational analyses make it challenging to compare data across experiments. Here we present scmap (http://bioconductor.org/packages/scmap; web version at http://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/tools/scmap), a method for projecting cells from an scRNA-seq data set onto cell types or individual cells from other experiments.
33098418	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Single-cell RNA-seq data semi-supervised clustering and annotation via structural regularized domain adaptation.	MOTIVATION: The rapid development of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies allows us to explore tissue heterogeneity at the cellular level. The identification of cell types plays an essential role in the analysis of scRNA-seq data, which, in turn, influences the discovery of regulatory genes that induce heterogeneity. As the scale of sequencing data increases, the classical method of combining clustering and differential expression analysis to annotate cells becomes more costly in terms of both labor and resources. Existing scRNA-seq supervised classification method can alleviate this issue through learning a classifier trained on the labeled reference data and then making a prediction based on the unlabeled target data. However, such label transference strategy carries with risks, such as susceptibility to batch effect and further compromise of inherent discrimination of target data. RESULTS: In this article, inspired by unsupervised domain adaptation, we propose a flexible single cell semi-supervised clustering and annotation framework, scSemiCluster, which integrates the reference data and target data for training. We utilize structure similarity regularization on the reference domain to restrict the clustering solutions of the target domain. We also incorporates pairwise constraints in the feature learning process such that cells belonging to the same cluster are close to each other, and cells belonging to different clusters are far from each other in the latent space. Notably, without explicit domain alignment and batch effect correction, scSemiCluster outperforms other state-of-the-art, single-cell supervised classification and semi-supervised clustering annotation algorithms in both simulation and real data. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use both deep discriminative clustering and deep generative clustering techniques in the single-cell field. AVAILABILITYAND IMPLEMENTATION: An implementation of scSemiCluster is available from https://github.com/xuebaliang/scSemiCluster. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
32142108	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Statistical significance of cluster membership for unsupervised evaluation of cell identities.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows us to dissect transcriptional heterogeneity arising from cellular types, spatio-temporal contexts and environmental stimuli. Transcriptional heterogeneity may reflect phenotypes and molecular signatures that are often unmeasured or unknown a priori. Cell identities of samples derived from heterogeneous subpopulations are then determined by clustering of scRNA-seq data. These cell identities are used in downstream analyses. How can we examine if cell identities are accurately inferred? Unlike external measurements or labels for single cells, using clustering-based cell identities result in spurious signals and false discoveries. RESULTS: We introduce non-parametric methods to evaluate cell identities by testing cluster memberships in an unsupervised manner. Diverse simulation studies demonstrate accuracy of the jackstraw test for cluster membership. We propose a posterior probability that a cell should be included in that clustering-based subpopulation. Posterior inclusion probabilities (PIPs) for cluster memberships can be used to select and visualize samples relevant to subpopulations. The proposed methods are applied on three scRNA-seq datasets. First, a mixture of Jurkat and 293T cell lines provides two distinct cellular populations. Second, Cell Hashing yields cell identities corresponding to eight donors which are independently analyzed by the jackstraw. Third, peripheral blood mononuclear cells are used to explore heterogeneous immune populations. The proposed P-values and PIPs lead to probabilistic feature selection of single cells that can be visualized using principal component analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and others. By learning uncertainty in clustering high-dimensional data, the proposed methods enable unsupervised evaluation of cluster membership.

35927477	2022	Nature methods	Sprod for de-noising spatially resolved transcriptomics data based on position and image information.	Spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) provide gene expression close to, or even superior to, single-cell resolution while retaining the physical locations of sequencing and often also providing matched pathology images. However, SRT expression data suffer from high noise levels, due to the shallow coverage in each sequencing unit and the extra experimental steps required to preserve the locations of sequencing. Fortunately, such noise can be removed by leveraging information from the physical locations of sequencing, and the tissue organization reflected in corresponding pathology images. In this work, we developed Sprod, based on latent graph learning of matched location and imaging data, to impute accurate SRT gene expression. We validated Sprod comprehensively and demonstrated its advantages over previous methods for removing drop-outs in single-cell RNA-sequencing data. We showed that, after imputation by Sprod, differential expression analyses, pathway enrichment and cell-to-cell interaction inferences are more accurate. Overall, we envision de-noising by Sprod to become a key first step towards empowering SRT technologies for biomedical discoveries.
40698866	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	scGGC: a two-stage strategy for single-cell clustering through cellular gene pathway construction.	In the last few years, there has been great advancement in the field of single-cell data investigation, particularly in the development of clustering methods. The advanced research is increased for the development of clustering algorithms tailored for single-cell RNA sequencing data. Conventional methods primarily focus on local relationships among cells or genes, while overlooking the global cell-gene interactions. As a result, the high dimensionality, noise, and sparsity of the data continue to pose significant challenges to clustering accuracy. To address the challenges of single-cell clustering analysis, we propose a novel single-cell clustering model, scGGC, which integrates graph autoencoders and generative adversarial network techniques. The innovations of scGGC include two components: (i) construction of an adjacency matrix that incorporates cell-cell and cell-gene relationships to capture complex interactions in a graph structure, enabling nonlinear dimensionality reduction and initial clustering via a graph autoencoder; (ii) enhancement of clustering performance by selecting high-confidence samples from the initial clusters for adversarial neural network training. A comprehensive evaluation on nine publicly available scRNA-seq datasets demonstrates that scGGC outperforms eight comparison methods. For example, on datasets such as MHC3K, the Adjusted Rand Index increases by an average of 10.1%. Furthermore, marker gene identification and cell type annotation further confirm the biological relevance of scGGC, with marker gene overlap rates exceeding 70% across multiple datasets. We conclude that scGGC not only improves the accuracy of single-cell data clustering but also enhances the identification of cell-type-specific marker genes. The scGGC code is available at https://github.com/Zhi1002/scGGC.
41117775	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	PseudotimeDE-fast: fast testing of differential gene expression along cell pseudotime.	SUMMARY: Identifying differentially expressed (DE) genes along cell pseudotime is crucial for understanding dynamic biological processes captured by single-cell RNA sequencing. However, existing DE methods either produce invalid P-values by ignoring the uncertainty in pseudotime inference or struggle to scale with the growing size of modern datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce PseudotimeDE-fast, a scalable method for detecting DE genes along pseudotime with well-calibrated P-values. Through comprehensive simulations and real-data analyses, we demonstrate that PseudotimeDE-fast delivers comparable or superior performance to existing approaches while offering substantial improvements in computational efficiency. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: PseudotimeDE-fast is implemented in R with Rcpp acceleration and released under the MIT license. The source code is available at: https://github.com/dsong-lab/PseudotimeDE.
38627250	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Topological benchmarking of algorithms to infer gene regulatory networks from single-cell RNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: In recent years, many algorithms for inferring gene regulatory networks from single-cell transcriptomic data have been published. Several studies have evaluated their accuracy in estimating the presence of an interaction between pairs of genes. However, these benchmarking analyses do not quantify the algorithms' ability to capture structural properties of networks, which are fundamental, e.g., for studying the robustness of a gene network to external perturbations. Here, we devise a three-step benchmarking pipeline called STREAMLINE that quantifies the ability of algorithms to capture topological properties of networks and identify hubs. RESULTS: To this aim, we use data simulated from different types of networks as well as experimental data from three different organisms. We apply our benchmarking pipeline to four inference algorithms and provide guidance on which algorithm should be used depending on the global network property of interest. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: STREAMLINE is available at https://github.com/ScialdoneLab/STREAMLINE. The data generated in this study are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10710444.
38366652	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	SpatialDDLS: an R package to deconvolute spatial transcriptomics data using neural networks.	SUMMARY: Spatial transcriptomics has changed our way to study tissue structure and cellular organization. However, there are still limitations in its resolution, and most available platforms do not reach a single cell resolution. To address this issue, we introduce SpatialDDLS, a fast neural network-based algorithm for cell type deconvolution of spatial transcriptomics data. SpatialDDLS leverages single-cell RNA sequencing data to simulate mixed transcriptional profiles with predefined cellular composition, which are subsequently used to train a fully connected neural network to uncover cell type diversity within each spot. By comparing it with two state-of-the-art spatial deconvolution methods, we demonstrate that SpatialDDLS is an accurate and fast alternative to the available state-of-the art tools. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The R package SpatialDDLS is available via CRAN-The Comprehensive R Archive Network: https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SpatialDDLS. A detailed manual of the main functionalities implemented in the package can be found at https://diegommcc.github.io/SpatialDDLS.
35048116	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	Accurate and fast cell marker gene identification with COSG.	Accurate cell classification is the groundwork for downstream analysis of single-cell sequencing data, yet how to identify true marker genes for different cell types still remains a big challenge. Here, we report COSine similarity-based marker Gene identification (COSG) as a cosine similarity-based method for more accurate and scalable marker gene identification. COSG is applicable to single-cell RNA sequencing data, single-cell ATAC sequencing data and spatially resolved transcriptome data. COSG is fast and scalable for ultra-large datasets of million-scale cells. Application on both simulated and real experimental datasets showed that the marker genes or genomic regions identified by COSG have greater cell-type specificity, demonstrating the superior performance of COSG in terms of both accuracy and efficiency as compared with other available methods.
34752449	2021	PLoS computational biology	Approximate distance correlation for selecting highly interrelated genes across datasets.	With the rapid accumulation of biological omics datasets, decoding the underlying relationships of cross-dataset genes becomes an important issue. Previous studies have attempted to identify differentially expressed genes across datasets. However, it is hard for them to detect interrelated ones. Moreover, existing correlation-based algorithms can only measure the relationship between genes within a single dataset or two multi-modal datasets from the same samples. It is still unclear how to quantify the strength of association of the same gene across two biological datasets with different samples. To this end, we propose Approximate Distance Correlation (ADC) to select interrelated genes with statistical significance across two different biological datasets. ADC first obtains the k most correlated genes for each target gene as its approximate observations, and then calculates the distance correlation (DC) for the target gene across two datasets. ADC repeats this process for all genes and then performs the Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment to control the false discovery rate. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ADC with simulation data and four real applications to select highly interrelated genes across two datasets. These four applications including 21 cancer RNA-seq datasets of different tissues; six single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) datasets of mouse hematopoietic cells across six different cell types along the hematopoietic cell lineage; five scRNA-seq datasets of pancreatic islet cells across five different technologies; coupled single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) and scRNA-seq data of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Extensive results demonstrate that ADC is a powerful tool to uncover interrelated genes with strong biological implications and is scalable to large-scale datasets. Moreover, the number of such genes can serve as a metric to measure the similarity between two datasets, which could characterize the relative difference of diverse cell types and technologies.
39073888	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	ClusterMatch aligns single-cell RNA-sequencing data at the multi-scale cluster level via stable matching.	MOTIVATION: Unsupervised clustering of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data holds the promise of characterizing known and novel cell type in various biological and clinical contexts. However, intrinsic multi-scale clustering resolutions poses challenges to deal with multiple sources of variability in the high-dimensional and noisy data. RESULTS: We present ClusterMatch, a stable match optimization model to align scRNA-seq data at the cluster level. In one hand, ClusterMatch leverages the mutual correspondence by canonical correlation analysis and multi-scale Louvain clustering algorithms to identify cluster with optimized resolutions. In the other hand, it utilizes stable matching framework to align scRNA-seq data in the latent space while maintaining interpretability with overlapped marker gene set. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of ClusterMatch in data integration, cell type annotation, and cross-species/timepoint alignment scenarios. Our results show ClusterMatch's ability to utilize both global and local information of scRNA-seq data, sets the appropriate resolution of multi-scale clustering, and offers interpretability by utilizing marker genes. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The code of ClusterMatch software is freely available at https://github.com/AMSSwanglab/ClusterMatch.
39425176	2024	Genome biology	Scalable identification of lineage-specific gene regulatory networks from metacells with NetID.	The identification of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is crucial for understanding cellular differentiation. Single-cell RNA sequencing data encode gene-level covariations at high resolution, yet data sparsity and high dimensionality hamper accurate and scalable GRN reconstruction. To overcome these challenges, we introduce NetID leveraging homogenous metacells while avoiding spurious gene-gene correlations. Benchmarking demonstrates superior performance of NetID compared to imputation-based methods. By incorporating cell fate probability information, NetID facilitates the prediction of lineage-specific GRNs and recovers known network motifs governing bone marrow hematopoiesis, making it a powerful toolkit for deciphering gene regulatory control of cellular differentiation from large-scale single-cell transcriptome data.
39529170	2024	Genome biology	Adenine base editors induce off-target structure variations in mouse embryos and primary human T cells.	BACKGROUND: The safety of CRISPR-based gene editing methods is of the utmost priority in clinical applications. Previous studies have reported that Cas9 cleavage induced frequent aneuploidy in primary human T cells, but whether cleavage-mediated editing of base editors would generate off-target structure variations remains unknown. Here, we investigate the potential off-target structural variations associated with CRISPR/Cas9, ABE, and CBE editing in mouse embryos and primary human T cells by whole-genome sequencing and single-cell RNA-seq analyses. RESULTS: The results show that both Cas9 and ABE generate off-target structural variations (SVs) in mouse embryos, while CBE induces rare SVs. In addition, off-target large deletions are detected in 32.74% of primary human T cells transfected with Cas9 and 9.17% of cells transfected with ABE. Moreover, Cas9-induced aneuploid cells activate the P53 and apoptosis pathways, whereas ABE-associated aneuploid cells significantly upregulate cell cycle-related genes and are arrested in the G0 phase. A percentage of 16.59% and 4.29% aneuploid cells are still observable at 3 weeks post transfection of Cas9 or ABE. These off-target phenomena in ABE are universal as observed in other cell types such as B cells and Huh7. Furthermore, the off-target SVs are significantly reduced in cells treated with high-fidelity ABE (ABE-V106W). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows both CRISPR/Cas9 and ABE induce off-target SVs in mouse embryos and primary human T cells, raising an urgent need for the development of high-fidelity gene editing tools.
30333049	2018	Genome biology	Holo-Seq: single-cell sequencing of holo-transcriptome.	Current single-cell RNA-seq approaches are hindered by preamplification bias, loss of strand of origin information, and the inability to observe small-RNA and mRNA dual transcriptomes. Here, we introduce a single-cell holo-transcriptome sequencing (Holo-Seq) that overcomes all three hurdles. Holo-Seq has the same quantitative accuracy and uniform coverage with a complete strand of origin information as bulk RNA-seq. Most importantly, Holo-Seq can simultaneously observe small RNAs and mRNAs in a single cell. Furthermore, we acquire small RNA and mRNA dual transcriptomes of 32 human hepatocellular carcinoma single cells, which display the genome-wide super-enhancer activity and hepatic neoplasm kinetics of these cells.
35349572	2022	PLoS computational biology	PLUS: Predicting cancer metastasis potential based on positive and unlabeled learning.	Metastatic cancer accounts for over 90% of all cancer deaths, and evaluations of metastasis potential are vital for minimizing the metastasis-associated mortality and achieving optimal clinical decision-making. Computational assessment of metastasis potential based on large-scale transcriptomic cancer data is challenging because metastasis events are not always clinically detectable. The under-diagnosis of metastasis events results in biased classification labels, and classification tools using biased labels may lead to inaccurate estimations of metastasis potential. This issue is further complicated by the unknown metastasis prevalence at the population level, the small number of confirmed metastasis cases, and the high dimensionality of the candidate molecular features. Our proposed algorithm, called Positive and unlabeled Learning from Unbalanced cases and Sparse structures (PLUS), is the first to use a positive and unlabeled learning framework to account for the under-detection of metastasis events in building a classifier. PLUS is specifically tailored for studying metastasis that deals with the unbalanced instance allocation as well as unknown metastasis prevalence, which are not considered by other methods. PLUS achieves superior performance on synthetic datasets compared with other state-of-the-art methods. Application of PLUS to The Cancer Genome Atlas Pan-Cancer gene expression data generated metastasis potential predictions that show good agreement with the clinical follow-up data, in addition to predictive genes that have been validated by independent single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets.
33855366	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	Elucidating transcriptomic profiles from single-cell RNA sequencing data using nature-inspired compressed sensing.	Gene-expression profiling can define the cell state and gene-expression pattern of cells at the genetic level in a high-throughput manner. With the development of transcriptome techniques, processing high-dimensional genetic data has become a major challenge in expression profiling. Thanks to the recent widespread use of matrix decomposition methods in bioinformatics, a computational framework based on compressed sensing was adopted to reduce dimensionality. However, compressed sensing requires an optimization strategy to learn the modular dictionaries and activity levels from the low-dimensional random composite measurements to reconstruct the high-dimensional gene-expression data. Considering this, here we introduce and compare four compressed sensing frameworks coming from nature-inspired optimization algorithms (CSCS, ABCCS, BACS and FACS) to improve the quality of the decompression process. Several experiments establish that the three proposed methods outperform benchmark methods on nine different datasets, especially the FACS method. We illustrate therefore, the robustness and convergence of FACS in various aspects; notably, time complexity and parameter analyses highlight properties of our proposed FACS. Furthermore, differential gene-expression analysis, cell-type clustering, gene ontology enrichment and pathology analysis are conducted, which bring novel insights into cell-type identification and characterization mechanisms from different perspectives. All algorithms are written in Python and available at https://github.com/Philyzh8/Nature-inspired-CS.
36193998	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scSemiGAN: a single-cell semi-supervised annotation and dimensionality reduction framework based on generative adversarial network.	MOTIVATION: Cell-type annotation plays a crucial role in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data analysis. As more and more well-annotated scRNA-seq reference data are publicly available, automatical label transference algorithms are gaining popularity over manual marker gene-based annotation methods. However, most existing methods fail to unify cell-type annotation with dimensionality reduction and are unable to generate deep latent representation from the perspective of data generation. RESULTS: In this article, we propose scSemiGAN, a single-cell semi-supervised cell-type annotation and dimensionality reduction framework based on a generative adversarial network, to overcome these challenges, modeling scRNA-seq data from the aspect of data generation. Our proposed scSemiGAN is capable of performing deep latent representation learning and cell-type label prediction simultaneously. Through extensive comparison with four state-of-the-art annotation methods on diverse simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets, scSemiGAN achieves competitive or superior performance in multiple downstream tasks including cell-type annotation, latent representation visualization, confounding factor removal and enrichment analysis. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The code and data of scSemiGAN are available on GitHub: https://github.com/rafa-nadal/scSemiGAN. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
39026273	2024	Genome biology	Single-cell decoding of drug induced transcriptomic reprogramming in triple negative breast cancers.	BACKGROUND: The encoding of cell intrinsic drug resistance states in breast cancer reflects the contributions of genomic and non-genomic variations and requires accurate estimation of clonal fitness from co-measurement of transcriptomic and genomic data. Somatic copy number (CN) variation is the dominant mutational mechanism leading to transcriptional variation and notably contributes to platinum chemotherapy resistance cell states. Here, we deploy time series measurements of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) single-cell transcriptomes, along with co-measured single-cell CN fitness, identifying genomic and transcriptomic mechanisms in drug-associated transcriptional cell states. RESULTS: We present scRNA-seq data (53,641 filtered cells) from serial passaging TNBC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) experiments spanning 2.5 years, matched with genomic single-cell CN data from the same samples. Our findings reveal distinct clonal responses within TNBC tumors exposed to platinum. Clones with high drug fitness undergo clonal sweeps and show subtle transcriptional reversion, while those with weak fitness exhibit dynamic transcription upon drug withdrawal. Pathway analysis highlights convergence on epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cytokine signaling, associated with resistance. Furthermore, pseudotime analysis demonstrates hysteresis in transcriptional reversion, indicating generation of new intermediate transcriptional states upon platinum exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Within a polyclonal tumor, clones with strong genotype-associated fitness under platinum remained fixed, minimizing transcriptional reversion upon drug withdrawal. Conversely, clones with weaker fitness display non-genomic transcriptional plasticity. This suggests CN-associated and CN-independent transcriptional states could both contribute to platinum resistance. The dominance of genomic or non-genomic mechanisms within polyclonal tumors has implications for drug sensitivity, restoration, and re-treatment strategies.
28419223	2017	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Removal of batch effects using distribution-matching residual networks.	MOTIVATION: Sources of variability in experimentally derived data include measurement error in addition to the physical phenomena of interest. This measurement error is a combination of systematic components, originating from the measuring instrument and random measurement errors. Several novel biological technologies, such as mass cytometry and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), are plagued with systematic errors that may severely affect statistical analysis if the data are not properly calibrated. RESULTS: We propose a novel deep learning approach for removing systematic batch effects. Our method is based on a residual neural network, trained to minimize the Maximum Mean Discrepancy between the multivariate distributions of two replicates, measured in different batches. We apply our method to mass cytometry and scRNA-seq datasets, and demonstrate that it effectively attenuates batch effects. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: our codes and data are publicly available at https://github.com/ushaham/BatchEffectRemoval.git. CONTACT: yuval.kluger@yale.edu.

33544846	2021	Nucleic acids research	SPOTlight: seeded NMF regression to deconvolute spatial transcriptomics spots with single-cell transcriptomes.	Spatially resolved gene expression profiles are key to understand tissue organization and function. However, spatial transcriptomics (ST) profiling techniques lack single-cell resolution and require a combination with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) information to deconvolute the spatially indexed datasets. Leveraging the strengths of both data types, we developed SPOTlight, a computational tool that enables the integration of ST with scRNA-seq data to infer the location of cell types and states within a complex tissue. SPOTlight is centered around a seeded non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) regression, initialized using cell-type marker genes and non-negative least squares (NNLS) to subsequently deconvolute ST capture locations (spots). Simulating varying reference quantities and qualities, we confirmed high prediction accuracy also with shallowly sequenced or small-sized scRNA-seq reference datasets. SPOTlight deconvolution of the mouse brain correctly mapped subtle neuronal cell states of the cortical layers and the defined architecture of the hippocampus. In human pancreatic cancer, we successfully segmented patient sections and further fine-mapped normal and neoplastic cell states. Trained on an external single-cell pancreatic tumor references, we further charted the localization of clinical-relevant and tumor-specific immune cell states, an illustrative example of its flexible application spectrum and future potential in digital pathology.
37974276	2023	Genome biology	Cytomulate: accurate and efficient simulation of CyTOF data.	Recently, many analysis tools have been devised to offer insights into data generated via cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF). However, objective evaluations of these methods remain absent as most evaluations are conducted against real data where the ground truth is generally unknown. In this paper, we develop Cytomulate, a reproducible and accurate simulation algorithm of CyTOF data, which could serve as a foundation for future method development and evaluation. We demonstrate that Cytomulate can capture various characteristics of CyTOF data and is superior in learning overall data distributions than single-cell RNA-seq-oriented methods such as scDesign2, Splatter, and generative models like LAMBDA.
36928074	2023	Nature methods	Femtosecond laser microdissection for isolation of regenerating C. elegans neurons for single-cell RNA sequencing.	Our understanding of nerve regeneration can be enhanced by delineating its underlying molecular activities at single-neuron resolution in model organisms such as Caenorhabditis elegans. Existing cell isolation techniques cannot isolate neurons with specific regeneration phenotypes from C. elegans. We present femtosecond laser microdissection (fs-LM), a single-cell isolation method that dissects specific cells directly from living tissue by leveraging the micrometer-scale precision of fs-laser ablation. We show that fs-LM facilitates sensitive and specific gene expression profiling by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), while mitigating the stress-related transcriptional artifacts induced by tissue dissociation. scRNA-seq of fs-LM isolated regenerating neurons revealed transcriptional programs that are correlated with either successful or failed regeneration in wild-type and dlk-1 (0) animals, respectively. This method also allowed studying heterogeneity displayed by the same type of neuron and found gene modules with expression patterns correlated with axon regrowth rate. Our results establish fs-LM as a spatially resolved single-cell isolation method for phenotype-to-genotype mapping.
35513526	2022	Nature biotechnology	DIALOGUE maps multicellular programs in tissue from single-cell or spatial transcriptomics data.	Deciphering the functional interactions of cells in tissues remains a major challenge. Here we describe DIALOGUE, a method to systematically uncover multicellular programs (MCPs)-combinations of coordinated cellular programs in different cell types that form higher-order functional units at the tissue level-from either spatial data or single-cell data obtained without spatial information. Tested on spatial datasets from the mouse hypothalamus, cerebellum, visual cortex and neocortex, DIALOGUE identified MCPs associated with animal behavior and recovered spatial properties when tested on unseen data while outperforming other methods and metrics. In spatial data from human lung cancer, DIALOGUE identified MCPs marking immune activation and tissue remodeling. Applied to single-cell RNA sequencing data across individuals or regions, DIALOGUE uncovered MCPs marking Alzheimer's disease, ulcerative colitis and resistance to cancer immunotherapy. These programs were predictive of disease outcome and predisposition in independent cohorts and included risk genes from genome-wide association studies. DIALOGUE enables the analysis of multicellular regulation in health and disease.
30744683	2019	Genome biology	CellFishing.jl: an ultrafast and scalable cell search method for single-cell RNA sequencing.	Recent technical improvements in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have enabled massively parallel profiling of transcriptomes, thereby promoting large-scale studies encompassing a wide range of cell types of multicellular organisms. With this background, we propose CellFishing.jl, a new method for searching atlas-scale datasets for similar cells and detecting noteworthy genes of query cells with high accuracy and throughput. Using multiple scRNA-seq datasets, we validate that our method demonstrates comparable accuracy to and is markedly faster than the state-of-the-art software. Moreover, CellFishing.jl is scalable to more than one million cells, and the throughput of the search is approximately 1600 cells per second.
38889273	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scCross: efficient search for rare subpopulations across multiple single-cell samples.	MOTIVATION: Identifying rare cell types is an important task to capture the heterogeneity of single-cell data, such as scRNA-seq. The widespread availability of such data enables to aggregate multiple samples, corresponding for example to different donors, into the same study. Yet, such aggregated data is often subject to batch effects between samples. Clustering it therefore generally requires the use of data integration methods, which can lead to overcorrection, making the identification of rare cells difficult. We present scCross, a biclustering method identifying rare subpopulations of cells present across multiple single-cell samples. It jointly identifies a group of cells with specific marker genes by relying on a global sum criterion, computed over entire subpopulation of cells, rather than pairwise comparisons between individual cells. This proves robust with respect to the high variability of scRNA-seq data, in particular batch effects. RESULTS: We show through several case studies that scCross is able to identify rare subpopulations across multiple samples without performing prior data integration. Namely, it identifies a cilium subpopulation with potential new ciliary genes from lung cancer cells, which is not detected by typical alternatives. It also highlights rare subpopulations in human pancreas samples sequenced with different protocols, despite visible shifts in expression levels between batches. We further show that scCross outperforms typical alternatives at identifying a target rare cell type in a controlled experiment with artificially created batch effects. This shows the ability of scCross to efficiently identify rare cell subpopulations characterized by specific genes despite the presence of batch effects. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The R and Scala implementation of scCross is freely available on GitHub, at https://github.com/agerniers/scCross/. A snapshot of the code and the data underlying this article are available on Zenodo, at https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10471063.
32329779	2020	Nucleic acids research	Prediction of condition-specific regulatory genes using machine learning.	Recent advances in genomic technologies have generated data on large-scale protein-DNA interactions and open chromatin regions for many eukaryotic species. How to identify condition-specific functions of transcription factors using these data has become a major challenge in genomic research. To solve this problem, we have developed a method called ConSReg, which provides a novel approach to integrate regulatory genomic data into predictive machine learning models of key regulatory genes. Using Arabidopsis as a model system, we tested our approach to identify regulatory genes in data sets from single cell gene expression and from abiotic stress treatments. Our results showed that ConSReg accurately predicted transcription factors that regulate differentially expressed genes with an average auROC of 0.84, which is 23.5-25% better than enrichment-based approaches. To further validate the performance of ConSReg, we analyzed an independent data set related to plant nitrogen responses. ConSReg provided better rankings of the correct transcription factors in 61.7% of cases, which is three times better than other plant tools. We applied ConSReg to Arabidopsis single cell RNA-seq data, successfully identifying candidate regulatory genes that control cell wall formation. Our methods provide a new approach to define candidate regulatory genes using integrated genomic data in plants.
34450641	2021	Nucleic acids research	HDAC1 is required for GATA-1 transcription activity, global chromatin occupancy and hematopoiesis.	The activity of hematopoietic factor GATA-1 is modulated through p300/CBP-mediated acetylation and FOG-1 mediated indirect interaction with HDAC1/2 containing NuRD complex. Although GATA-1 acetylation is implicated in GATA-1 activation, the role of deacetylation is not studied. Here, we found that the FOG-1/NuRD does not deacetylate GATA-1. However, HDAC1/2 can directly bind and deacetylate GATA-1. Two arginine residues within the GATA-1 linker region mediates direct interaction with HDAC1. The arginine to alanine mutation (2RA) blocks GATA-1 deacetylation and fails to induce erythroid differentiation. Gene expression profiling and ChIP-seq analysis further demonstrate the importance of GATA-1 deacetylation for gene activation and chromatin recruitment. GATA-12RA knock-in (KI) mice suffer mild anemia and thrombocytopenia with accumulation of immature erythrocytes and megakaryocytes in bone marrow and spleen. Single cell RNA-seq analysis of Lin- cKit+ (LK) cells further reveal a profound change in cell subpopulations and signature gene expression patterns in HSC, myeloid progenitors, and erythroid/megakaryocyte clusters in KI mice. Thus, GATA-1 deacetylation and its interaction with HDAC1 modulates GATA-1 chromatin binding and transcriptional activity that control erythroid/megakaryocyte commitment and differentiation.
32730566	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Discovering a sparse set of pairwise discriminating features in high-dimensional data.	MOTIVATION: Recent technological advances produce a wealth of high-dimensional descriptions of biological processes, yet extracting meaningful insight and mechanistic understanding from these data remains challenging. For example, in developmental biology, the dynamics of differentiation can now be mapped quantitatively using single-cell RNA sequencing, yet it is difficult to infer molecular regulators of developmental transitions. Here, we show that discovering informative features in the data is crucial for statistical analysis as well as making experimental predictions. RESULTS: We identify features based on their ability to discriminate between clusters of the data points. We define a class of problems in which linear separability of clusters is hidden in a low-dimensional space. We propose an unsupervised method to identify the subset of features that define a low-dimensional subspace in which clustering can be conducted. This is achieved by averaging over discriminators trained on an ensemble of proposed cluster configurations. We then apply our method to single-cell RNA-seq data from mouse gastrulation, and identify 27 key transcription factors (out of 409 total), 18 of which are known to define cell states through their expression levels. In this inferred subspace, we find clear signatures of known cell types that eluded classification prior to discovery of the correct low-dimensional subspace.

41148222	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	ChromoPattern: characterizing chromosomal rearrangement patterns of copy number alteration in heterogeneous tumor cell populations at single-cell resolution.	Cancer is characterized by aneuploidy, often resulting from chromosomal instability (CIN) due to events such as whole-genome duplication (WGD), breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) cycles, and chromothripsis. These catastrophic events drive de novo copy number alterations (CNAs) with different chromosomal rearrangement patterns, contributing to tumor heterogeneity and evolution. The lack of methods capable of dissecting complex patterns of CNAs at single-cell resolution limits the understanding of how chromosome aneuploidy influences tumor evolution. To address this, we developed ChromoPattern, a computational framework to quantify four distinct chromosomal rearrangement patterns associated with complex CNA mechanisms based on single-cell copy number profiles. ChromoPattern effectively differentiates these patterns through simulations and real-world data. We applied ChromoPattern to single-cell DNA sequencing data from a liver cancer cell line and breast cancer patients. Our analysis identified the oscillation pattern of CNAs as a significant contributor to tumor heterogeneity and evolution. This pattern was associated with a 20% increase in the de novo CNA rate during tumor evolution and was linked to increased intratumor heterogeneity and subclonality. Further analysis using single-cell RNA sequencing data demonstrated that tumor clones with an enriched oscillation pattern display increased cell cycle activity and a stem-like phenotype. These findings underscore the significant and differential roles of chromosomal rearrangement patterns in tumor heterogeneity and evolution. The identification of the oscillation pattern as a key driver of tumor heterogeneity and evolution opens new avenues for developing targeted therapies and diagnostic tools.
33940590	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	Improving Single-Cell RNA-seq Clustering by Integrating Pathways.	Single-cell clustering is an important part of analyzing single-cell RNA-sequencing data. However, the accuracy and robustness of existing methods are disturbed by noise. One promising approach for addressing this challenge is integrating pathway information, which can alleviate noise and improve performance. In this work, we studied the impact on accuracy and robustness of existing single-cell clustering methods by integrating pathways. We collected 10 state-of-the-art single-cell clustering methods, 26 scRNA-seq datasets and four pathway databases, combined the AUCell method and the similarity network fusion to integrate pathway data and scRNA-seq data, and introduced three accuracy indicators, three noise generation strategies and robustness indicators. Experiments on this framework showed that integrating pathways can significantly improve the accuracy and robustness of most single-cell clustering methods.
32232416	2020	Nucleic acids research	Uncovering the key dimensions of high-throughput biomolecular data using deep learning.	Recent advances in high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq have enabled us to measure thousands of gene expression levels at single-cell resolution. However, the transcriptomic profiles are high-dimensional and sparse in nature. To address it, a deep learning framework based on auto-encoder, termed DeepAE, is proposed to elucidate high-dimensional transcriptomic profiling data in an encode-decode manner. Comparative experiments were conducted on nine transcriptomic profiling datasets to compare DeepAE with four benchmark methods. The results demonstrate that the proposed DeepAE outperforms the benchmark methods with robust performance on uncovering the key dimensions of single-cell RNA-seq data. In addition, we also investigate the performance of DeepAE in other contexts and platforms such as mass cytometry and metabolic profiling in a comprehensive manner. Gene ontology enrichment and pathology analysis are conducted to reveal the mechanisms behind the robust performance of DeepAE by uncovering its key dimensions.
36991470	2023	Genome biology	The shaky foundations of simulating single-cell RNA sequencing data.	BACKGROUND: With the emergence of hundreds of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets, the number of computational tools to analyze aspects of the generated data has grown rapidly. As a result, there is a recurring need to demonstrate whether newly developed methods are truly performant-on their own as well as in comparison to existing tools. Benchmark studies aim to consolidate the space of available methods for a given task and often use simulated data that provide a ground truth for evaluations, thus demanding a high quality standard results credible and transferable to real data. RESULTS: Here, we evaluated methods for synthetic scRNA-seq data generation in their ability to mimic experimental data. Besides comparing gene- and cell-level quality control summaries in both one- and two-dimensional settings, we further quantified these at the batch- and cluster-level. Secondly, we investigate the effect of simulators on clustering and batch correction method comparisons, and, thirdly, which and to what extent quality control summaries can capture reference-simulation similarity. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that most simulators are unable to accommodate complex designs without introducing artificial effects, they yield over-optimistic performance of integration and potentially unreliable ranking of clustering methods, and it is generally unknown which summaries are important to ensure effective simulation-based method comparisons.
39563471	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Mutual information for detecting multi-class biomarkers when integrating multiple bulk or single-cell transcriptomic studies.	MOTIVATION: Biomarker detection plays a pivotal role in biomedical research. Integrating omics studies from multiple cohorts can enhance statistical power, accuracy, and robustness of the detection results. However, existing methods for horizontally combining omics studies are mostly designed for two-class scenarios (e.g. cases versus controls) and are not directly applicable for studies with multi-class design (e.g. samples from multiple disease subtypes, treatments, tissues, or cell types). RESULTS: We propose a statistical framework, namely Mutual Information Concordance Analysis (MICA), to detect biomarkers with concordant multi-class expression pattern across multiple omics studies from an information theoretic perspective. Our approach first detects biomarkers with concordant multi-class patterns across partial or all of the omics studies using a global test by mutual information. A post hoc analysis is then performed for each detected biomarkers and identify studies with concordant pattern. Extensive simulations demonstrate improved accuracy and successful false discovery rate control of MICA compared to an existing multi-class correlation method. The method is then applied to two practical scenarios: four tissues of mouse metabolism-related transcriptomic studies, and three sources of estrogen treatment expression profiles. Detected biomarkers by MICA show intriguing biological insights and functional annotations. Additionally, we implemented MICA for single-cell RNA-Seq data for tumor progression biomarkers, highlighting critical roles of ribosomal function in the tumor microenvironment of triple-negative breast cancer and underscoring the potential of MICA for detecting novel therapeutic targets. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code is available on Figshare at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.27635436. Additionally, the R package can be installed directly from GitHub at https://github.com/jianzou75/MICA.
35425987	2022	Nucleic acids research	YY1 safeguard multidimensional epigenetic landscape associated with extended pluripotency.	Although extended pluripotent stem cells (EPSCs) have the potential to form both embryonic and extraembryonic lineages, how their transcriptional regulatory mechanism differs from that of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) remains unclear. Here, we discovered that YY1 binds to specific open chromatin regions in EPSCs. Yy1 depletion in EPSCs leads to a gene expression pattern more similar to that of ESCs than control EPSCs. Moreover, Yy1 depletion triggers a series of epigenetic crosstalk activities, including changes in DNA methylation, histone modifications and high-order chromatin structures. Yy1 depletion in EPSCs disrupts the enhancer-promoter (EP) interactions of EPSC-specific genes, including Dnmt3l. Yy1 loss results in DNA hypomethylation and dramatically reduces the enrichment of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac on the promoters of EPSC-specific genes by upregulating the expression of Kdm5c and Hdac6 through facilitating the formation of CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF)-mediated EP interactions surrounding their loci. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiments revealed that YY1 is required for the derivation of extraembryonic endoderm (XEN)-like cells from EPSCs in vitro. Together, this study reveals that YY1 functions as a key regulator of multidimensional epigenetic crosstalk associated with extended pluripotency.
40662838	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Transcriptome assembly at single-cell resolution with Beaver.	MOTIVATION: The established single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies has revolutionized biological and biomedical research by enabling the measurement of gene expression at single-cell resolution. However, the fundamental challenge of reconstructing full-length transcripts for individual cells remains unresolved. Existing single-sample assembly approaches cannot leverage shared information across cells while meta-assembly approaches often fail to strike a balance between consensus assembly and preserving cell-specific expression signatures. RESULTS: We present Beaver, a cell-specific transcript assembler designed for short-read scRNA-seq data. Beaver implements a transcript fragment graph to organize individual assemblies and designs an efficient dynamic programming algorithm that searches for candidate full-length transcripts from the graph. Beaver incorporates two random forest models trained on 51 meticulously engineered features that accurately estimate the likelihood of each candidate transcript being expressed in individual cells. Our experiments, performed using both real and simulated Smart-seq3 scRNA-seq data, firmly show that Beaver substantially outperforms existing meta-assemblers and single-sample assemblers. At the same level of sensitivity, Beaver achieved 32.0%-64.6%, 13.5%-36.6%, and 9.8%-36.3% higher precision in average compared to meta-assemblers Aletsch, TransMeta, and PsiCLASS, respectively, with similar improvements over single-sample assemblers Scallop2 (10.1%-43.6%) and StringTie2 (24.3%-67.0%). AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Beaver is freely available at https://github.com/Shao-Group/beaver. Scripts that reproduce the experimental results of this manuscript are available at https://github.com/Shao-Group/beaver-test.
39540438	2025	Nucleic acids research	GTO: a comprehensive gene therapy omnibus.	Gene therapy, which involves the delivery of genetic material into cells to correct an underlying genetic problem, has emerged as a promising approach for treating various conditions. To promote research in this rapidly evolving field, we developed the Gene Therapy Omnibus (GTO) (http://www.inbirg.com/gto/), a comprehensive resource containing detailed clinical trial data and molecular information related to gene therapy. The GTO includes 6333 clinical trial records and 3466 transcriptome profiles, with information on 614 altered genes and 22 types of gene therapy, including DNA therapies, RNA therapies and genetically-modified cell therapies. For each gene therapy product in a clinical trial, detailed information, such as altered gene name, structural components, indication, vector information, phase of the clinical trial, clinical outcomes and adverse effects, is provided when available. Additionally, 345 comparison datasets, including 29 single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets comprising information on both gene therapy and control samples, were established. Differential gene expression and downstream functional enrichment analyses were performed through standardized pipelines to elucidate the molecular alterations induced by gene therapy. The user-friendly interface of the GTO supports efficient data retrieval, visualization and analysis, making it an invaluable resource for researchers and clinicians performing clinical research on gene therapy and the underlying mechanisms.
40495257	2025	Genome biology	Integration of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics by SEU-TCA reveals the spatial origin of early cardiac progenitors.	Obtaining single-cell spatial information remains a challenge in spatial transcriptomics. Here we develop SEU-TCA, a method that leverages transfer component analysis to improve single-cell spatial mapping accuracy. Application to multiple single-cell and spatial transcriptomic datasets shows superior performance in spatial deconvolution and cell mapping. Using SEU-TCA, we explore spatial gene expression and regulon activity during mouse gastrulation and identify anterior second heart field progenitors regulated by Irx1. Functional experiments reveal that Irx1 deletion disrupts anterior second heart field development and causes ventricular septal defects, underscoring SEU-TCA's potential for advancing developmental biology research.
35213533	2022	PLoS computational biology	IQCELL: A platform for predicting the effect of gene perturbations on developmental trajectories using single-cell RNA-seq data.	The increasing availability of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from various developmental systems provides the opportunity to infer gene regulatory networks (GRNs) directly from data. Herein we describe IQCELL, a platform to infer, simulate, and study executable logical GRNs directly from scRNA-seq data. Such executable GRNs allow simulation of fundamental hypotheses governing developmental programs and help accelerate the design of strategies to control stem cell fate. We first describe the architecture of IQCELL. Next, we apply IQCELL to scRNA-seq datasets from early mouse T-cell and red blood cell development, and show that the platform can infer overall over 74% of causal gene interactions previously reported from decades of research. We will also show that dynamic simulations of the generated GRN qualitatively recapitulate the effects of known gene perturbations. Finally, we implement an IQCELL gene selection pipeline that allows us to identify candidate genes, without prior knowledge. We demonstrate that GRN simulations based on the inferred set yield results similar to the original curated lists. In summary, the IQCELL platform offers a versatile tool to infer, simulate, and study executable GRNs in dynamic biological systems.
37507115	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	A comprehensive assessment of hurdle and zero-inflated models for single cell RNA-sequencing analysis.	Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has significantly advanced the understanding of transcriptomic signatures. Although various statistical models have been used to describe the distribution of gene expression across cells, a comprehensive assessment of the different models is missing. Moreover, the growing number of features associated with scRNA-seq datasets creates new challenges for analytical accuracy and computing speed. Here, we developed a Python-based package (TensorZINB) to solve the zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) model using the TensorFlow deep learning framework. We used a sequential initialization method to solve the numerical stability issues associated with hurdle and zero-inflated models. A recursive feature selection protocol was used to optimize feature selections for data processing and downstream differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis. We proposed a class of hybrid models combining nested models to further improve the model's performance. Additionally, we developed a new method to convert a continuous distribution to its equivalent discrete form, so that statistical models can be fairly compared. Finally, we showed that the proposed TensorFlow algorithm (TensorZINB) was numerically stable and that its computing speed and performance were superior to those of existing ZINB solvers. Moreover, we implemented seven hurdle and zero-inflated statistical models in Python and systematically assessed their performance using a real scRNA-seq dataset. We demonstrated that the ZINB model achieved the lowest Akaike information criterion compared with other models tested. Taken together, TensorZINB was accurate, efficient and scalable for the implementation of ZINB and for large-scale scRNA-seq data analysis with DEG identification.
29415263	2018	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scEpath: energy landscape-based inference of transition probabilities and cellular trajectories from single-cell transcriptomic data.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers unprecedented resolution for studying cellular decision-making processes. Robust inference of cell state transition paths and probabilities is an important yet challenging step in the analysis of these data. RESULTS: Here we present scEpath, an algorithm that calculates energy landscapes and probabilistic directed graphs in order to reconstruct developmental trajectories. We quantify the energy landscape using 'single-cell energy' and distance-based measures, and find that the combination of these enables robust inference of the transition probabilities and lineage relationships between cell states. We also identify marker genes and gene expression patterns associated with cell state transitions. Our approach produces pseudotemporal orderings that are-in combination-more robust and accurate than current methods, and offers higher resolution dynamics of the cell state transitions, leading to new insight into key transition events during differentiation and development. Moreover, scEpath is robust to variation in the size of the input gene set, and is broadly unsupervised, requiring few parameters to be set by the user. Applications of scEpath led to the identification of a cell-cell communication network implicated in early human embryo development, and novel transcription factors important for myoblast differentiation. scEpath allows us to identify common and specific temporal dynamics and transcriptional factor programs along branched lineages, as well as the transition probabilities that control cell fates. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: A MATLAB package of scEpath is available at https://github.com/sqjin/scEpath. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
36629274	2023	Nucleic acids research	Single-cell gene regulatory network prediction by explainable AI.	The molecular heterogeneity of cancer cells contributes to the often partial response to targeted therapies and relapse of disease due to the escape of resistant cell populations. While single-cell sequencing has started to improve our understanding of this heterogeneity, it offers a mostly descriptive view on cellular types and states. To obtain more functional insights, we propose scGeneRAI, an explainable deep learning approach that uses layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) to infer gene regulatory networks from static single-cell RNA sequencing data for individual cells. We benchmark our method with synthetic data and apply it to single-cell RNA sequencing data of a cohort of human lung cancers. From the predicted single-cell networks our approach reveals characteristic network patterns for tumor cells and normal epithelial cells and identifies subnetworks that are observed only in (subgroups of) tumor cells of certain patients. While current state-of-the-art methods are limited by their ability to only predict average networks for cell populations, our approach facilitates the reconstruction of networks down to the level of single cells which can be utilized to characterize the heterogeneity of gene regulation within and across tumors.
38924517	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	PredGCN: a Pruning-enabled Gene-Cell Net for automatic cell annotation of single cell transcriptome data.	MOTIVATION: The annotation of cell types from single-cell transcriptomics is essential for understanding the biological identity and functionality of cellular populations. Although manual annotation remains the gold standard, the advent of automatic pipelines has become crucial for scalable, unbiased, and cost-effective annotations. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of these automatic methods, particularly those employing deep learning, significantly depends on the architecture of the classifier and the quality and diversity of the training datasets. RESULTS: To address these limitations, we present a Pruning-enabled Gene-Cell Net (PredGCN) incorporating a Coupled Gene-Cell Net (CGCN) to enable representation learning and information storage. PredGCN integrates a Gene Splicing Net (GSN) and a Cell Stratification Net (CSN), employing a pruning operation (PrO) to dynamically tackle the complexity of heterogeneous cell identification. Among them, GSN leverages multiple statistical and hypothesis-driven feature extraction methods to selectively assemble genes with specificity for scRNA-seq data while CSN unifies elements based on diverse region demarcation principles, exploiting the representations from GSN and precise identification from different regional homogeneity perspectives. Furthermore, we develop a multi-objective Pareto pruning operation (Pareto PrO) to expand the dynamic capabilities of CGCN, optimizing the sub-network structure for accurate cell type annotation. Multiple comparison experiments on real scRNA-seq datasets from various species have demonstrated that PredGCN surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, including its scalability to cross-species datasets. Moreover, PredGCN can uncover unknown cell types and provide functional genomic analysis by quantifying the influence of genes on cell clusters, bringing new insights into cell type identification and characterizing scRNA-seq data from different perspectives. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code is available at https://github.com/IrisQi7/PredGCN and test data is available at https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/PredGCN/25251163.
27215581	2016	Genome biology	SLICER: inferring branched, nonlinear cellular trajectories from single cell RNA-seq data.	"Single cell experiments provide an unprecedented opportunity to reconstruct a sequence of changes in a biological process from individual ""snapshots"" of cells. However, nonlinear gene expression changes, genes unrelated to the process, and the possibility of branching trajectories make this a challenging problem. We develop SLICER (Selective Locally Linear Inference of Cellular Expression Relationships) to address these challenges. SLICER can infer highly nonlinear trajectories, select genes without prior knowledge of the process, and automatically determine the location and number of branches and loops. SLICER recovers the ordering of points along simulated trajectories more accurately than existing methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SLICER on previously published data from mouse lung cells and neural stem cells."
41231930	2025	PLoS computational biology	ScRDAVis: An R shiny application for single-cell transcriptome data analysis and visualization.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has revolutionized biological research by enabling a through exploration of cellular heterogeneity. However, the complexity of data processing pipelines and the need for programming expertise create barriers for many biologists to explore scRNA-seq data. To address this, we developed Single-cell RNA Data Analysis and Visualization (ScRDAVis), an interactive, browser-based R Shiny application tailored for biologists with no programming expertise. ScRDAVis integrates widely used analysis packages, such as Seurat, CellChat, Monocle3, clusterProfiler and hdWGCNA to provide a user-friendly interface for single-cell data analysis. The application supports single-sample, multiple-sample and group-based analyses, along with features such as marker discovery, cell type annotation, subclustering analysis, and advanced functional studies. Key functionalities include cell-cell communication analysis, trajectory and pseudotime inference, pathway enrichment analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and transcription factor (TF) regulatory network analysis. ScRDAVis stands out as the first GUI-based platform offering hdWGCNA for co-expression network and TF regulatory network analysis using scRNA-seq data. ScRDAVis provides publication-ready visualizations with data download options in different formats empowering researchers to extract meaningful biological insights and democratizing the analytical capabilities required to comprehensively analyze scRNA-seq studies.

40413869	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Multi-view clustering for single-cell RNA-seq data based on graph fusion.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides transcriptome profiling of individual cells, allowing for in-depth studies of cell heterogeneity at cell resolution. While cell clustering lays the basic foundation of scRNA-seq data analysis, the high-dimensionality and frequent dropout events of the data raise great challenges. Although plenty of dedicated clustering methods have been proposed, they often fail to fully explore the underlying data structure. Here, we introduce scMCGF, a new multi-view clustering algorithm based on graph fusion. It utilizes multi-view data generated from transcriptomic data to learn the consistent and complementary information across different view, ultimately constructing a unified graph matrix for robust cell clustering. Specifically, scMCGF utilizes two-dimensional-reduction methods (principal component analysis and diffusion maps) to capture both linear and non-linear characteristics of the data. Additionally, it calculates a cell-pathway score matrix to incorporate pathway-level information. These three features, along with the pre-processed gene expression data, form the multi-view data. scMCGF iteratively refines the structure of similarity graphs of each view through adaptive learning and learns a unified graph matrix by weighting and fusing the individual similarity graph matrix. The final clustering results are obtained by applying the rank constraint on the Laplacian matrix of the unified graph matrix. Experiments results of 13 real data sets reveal that scMCGF outperforms eight state-of-the-art methods in clustering accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, biological analysis validates that the clustering results of scMCGF provide a reliable foundation for downstream investigations.
40037523	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	AcImpute: a constraint-enhancing smooth-based approach for imputing single-cell RNA sequencing data.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides a powerful tool for studying cellular heterogeneity and complexity. However, dropout events in single-cell RNA-seq data severely hinder the effectiveness and accuracy of downstream analysis. Therefore, data preprocessing with imputation methods is crucial to scRNA-seq analysis. RESULTS: To address the issue of oversmoothing in smoothing-based imputation methods, the presented AcImpute, an unsupervised method that enhances imputation accuracy by constraining the smoothing weights among cells for genes with different expression levels. Compared with nine other imputation methods in cluster analysis and trajectory inference, the experimental results can demonstrate that AcImpute effectively restores gene expression, preserves inter-cell variability, preventing oversmoothing and improving clustering and trajectory inference performance. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The code is available at https://github.com/Liutto/AcImpute.
32290857	2020	Genome biology	Inference of single-cell phylogenies from lineage tracing data using Cassiopeia.	The pairing of CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing with massively parallel single-cell readouts now enables large-scale lineage tracing. However, the rapid growth in complexity of data from these assays has outpaced our ability to accurately infer phylogenetic relationships. First, we introduce Cassiopeia-a suite of scalable maximum parsimony approaches for tree reconstruction. Second, we provide a simulation framework for evaluating algorithms and exploring lineage tracer design principles. Finally, we generate the most complex experimental lineage tracing dataset to date, 34,557 human cells continuously traced over 15 generations, and use it for benchmarking phylogenetic inference approaches. We show that Cassiopeia outperforms traditional methods by several metrics and under a wide variety of parameter regimes, and provide insight into the principles for the design of improved Cas9-enabled recorders. Together, these should broadly enable large-scale mammalian lineage tracing efforts. Cassiopeia and its benchmarking resources are publicly available at www.github.com/YosefLab/Cassiopeia.
34715899	2021	Genome biology	Over 1000 tools reveal trends in the single-cell RNA-seq analysis landscape.

Since 2016, the scRNA-tools database has cataloged software tools for analyzing scRNA-seq data. With the number of tools in the database passing 1000, we provide an update on the state of the project and the field. This data shows the evolution of the field and a change of focus from ordering cells on continuous trajectories to integrating multiple samples and making use of reference datasets. We also find that open science practices reward developers with increased recognition and help accelerate the field.

36792372	2023	Genome research	Atlas-scale single-cell chromatin accessibility using nanowell-based combinatorial indexing.	Here we present advancements in single-cell combinatorial indexed Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin (sciATAC) to measure chromatin accessibility that leverage nanowell chips to achieve atlas-scale cell throughput (>10(5) cells) at low cost. The platform leverages the core of the sciATAC workflow where multiple indexed tagmentation reactions are performed, followed by pooling and distribution to a second set of reaction wells for polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based indexing. In this work, we instead leverage a chip containing 5184 nanowells at the PCR stage of indexing, enabling a 52-fold improvement in scale and reduction in per-cell preparation costs. We detail three variants that balance cell throughput and depth of coverage, and apply these methods to banked mouse brain tissue, producing maps of cell types as well as neuronal subtypes that include integration with existing single-cell Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin (scATAC) and scRNA-seq data sets. Our optimized workflow achieves a high fraction of reads that fall within called peaks (>80%) and low cell doublet rates. The high cell coverage technique produces high unique reads per cell, while retaining high enrichment for open chromatin regions, enabling the assessment of >70,000 unique accessible loci on average for each cell profiled. When compared to current methods in the field, our technique provides similar or superior per-cell information with very low levels of cell-to-cell cross talk, and achieves this at a cost point much lower than existing assays.
40728858	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	RGCN-BA: relational graph convolutional network with batch awareness for single-cell RNA sequencing clustering.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has opened new frontiers in biomedical research, offering insights into cellular heterogeneity. Accurate cell clustering and batch effect correction are essential in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis, forming the foundation for downstream steps. However, most methods handle these tasks separately, limiting their applicability across diverse datasets. To address these challenges, we introduce Relational Graph Convolutional Network with Batch Awareness (RGCN-BA), a deep learning framework that integrates cell clustering and batch effect correction into a unified model. For multi-batch datasets, RGCN-BA leverages relational graph convolutional network to process batch information as distinct edge types, followed by a batch correction layer for global alignment. For single-batch data, it functions with a single edge type. Experiments on both multi-batch and single-batch datasets demonstrate that RGCN-BA outperforms both specialized clustering methods and batch effect correction methods. This versatility in handling both tasks positions RGCN-BA as a powerful tool for enhancing scRNA-seq data analysis.
39438113	2024	Genome research	Binding profiles for 961 Drosophila and C. elegans transcription factors reveal tissue-specific regulatory relationships.	"A catalog of transcription factor (TF) binding sites in the genome is critical for deciphering regulatory relationships. Here, we present the culmination of the efforts of the modENCODE (model organism Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) and modERN (model organism Encyclopedia of Regulatory Networks) consortia to systematically assay TF binding events in vivo in two major model organisms, Drosophila melanogaster (fly) and Caenorhabditis elegans (worm). These data sets comprise 605 TFs identifying 3.6 M sites in the fly and 356 TFs identifying 0.9 M sites in the worm, and represent the majority of the regulatory space in each genome. We demonstrate that TFs associate with chromatin in clusters termed ""metapeaks,"" that larger metapeaks have characteristics of high-occupancy target (HOT) regions, and that the importance of consensus sequence motifs bound by TFs depends on metapeak size and complexity. Combining ChIP-seq data with single-cell RNA-seq data in a machine-learning model identifies TFs with a prominent role in promoting target gene expression in specific cell types, even differentiating between parent-daughter cells during embryogenesis. These data are a rich resource for the community that should fuel and guide future investigations into TF function. To facilitate data accessibility and utility, all strains expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged TFs are available at the stock centers for each organism. The chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data are available through the ENCODE Data Coordinating Center, GEO, and through a direct interface that provides rapid access to processed data sets and summary analyses, as well as widgets to probe the cell-type-specific TF-target relationships."
40421659	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	DECEPTICON: a correlation-based strategy for RNA-seq deconvolution inspired by a variation of the Anna Karenina principle.	Accurately deconvoluting cellular composition from bulk RNA-seq data is pivotal for understanding the tumor microenvironment and advancing precision medicine. Existing methods often struggle to consistently and accurately quantify cell types across heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, particularly when ground truths are unavailable. In this study, we introduce DECEPTICON, a deconvolution strategy inspired by the Anna Karenina principle, which postulates that successful outcomes share common traits, while failures are more varied. DECEPTICON selects top-performing methods by leveraging correlations between different strategies and combines them dynamically to enhance performance. Our approach demonstrates superior accuracy in predicting cell-type proportions across multiple tumor datasets, improving correlation by 23.9% and reducing root mean square error by 73.5% compared to the best of 50 analyzed strategies. Applied to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets for breast carcinoma, cervical squamous cell carcinoma, and lung adenocarcinoma, DECEPTICON-based predictions showed improved differentiation between patient prognoses. This correlation-based strategy offers a reliable, flexible tool for deconvoluting complex transcriptomic data and highlights its potential in refining prognostic assessments in oncology and advancing cancer biology.
35501392	2022	Nature biotechnology	Spatially informed cell-type deconvolution for spatial transcriptomics.	Many spatially resolved transcriptomic technologies do not have single-cell resolution but measure the average gene expression for each spot from a mixture of cells of potentially heterogeneous cell types. Here, we introduce a deconvolution method, conditional autoregressive-based deconvolution (CARD), that combines cell-type-specific expression information from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with correlation in cell-type composition across tissue locations. Modeling spatial correlation allows us to borrow the cell-type composition information across locations, improving accuracy of deconvolution even with a mismatched scRNA-seq reference. CARD can also impute cell-type compositions and gene expression levels at unmeasured tissue locations to enable the construction of a refined spatial tissue map with a resolution arbitrarily higher than that measured in the original study and can perform deconvolution without an scRNA-seq reference. Applications to four datasets, including a pancreatic cancer dataset, identified multiple cell types and molecular markers with distinct spatial localization that define the progression, heterogeneity and compartmentalization of pancreatic cancer.
35816553	2022	PLoS computational biology	The accuracy of absolute differential abundance analysis from relative count data.	Concerns have been raised about the use of relative abundance data derived from next generation sequencing as a proxy for absolute abundances. For example, in the differential abundance setting, compositional effects in relative abundance data may give rise to spurious differences (false positives) when considered from the absolute perspective. In practice however, relative abundances are often transformed by renormalization strategies intended to compensate for these effects and the scope of the practical problem remains unclear. We used simulated data to explore the consistency of differential abundance calling on renormalized relative abundances versus absolute abundances and find that, while overall consistency is high, with a median sensitivity (true positive rates) of 0.91 and specificity (1-false positive rates) of 0.89, consistency can be much lower where there is widespread change in the abundance of features across conditions. We confirm these findings on a large number of real data sets drawn from 16S metabarcoding, expression array, bulk RNA-seq, and single-cell RNA-seq experiments, where data sets with the greatest change between experimental conditions are also those with the highest false positive rates. Finally, we evaluate the predictive utility of summary features of relative abundance data themselves. Estimates of sparsity and the prevalence of feature-level change in relative abundance data give reasonable predictions of discrepancy in differential abundance calling in simulated data and can provide useful bounds for worst-case outcomes in real data.
31243426	2020	Briefings in bioinformatics	Machine learning and statistical methods for clustering single-cell RNA-sequencing data.	Single-cell RNAsequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have enabled the large-scale whole-transcriptome profiling of each individual single cell in a cell population. A core analysis of the scRNA-seq transcriptome profiles is to cluster the single cells to reveal cell subtypes and infer cell lineages based on the relations among the cells. This article reviews the machine learning and statistical methods for clustering scRNA-seq transcriptomes developed in the past few years. The review focuses on how conventional clustering techniques such as hierarchical clustering, graph-based clustering, mixture models, $k$-means, ensemble learning, neural networks and density-based clustering are modified or customized to tackle the unique challenges in scRNA-seq data analysis, such as the dropout of low-expression genes, low and uneven read coverage of transcripts, highly variable total mRNAs from single cells and ambiguous cell markers in the presence of technical biases and irrelevant confounding biological variations. We review how cell-specific normalization, the imputation of dropouts and dimension reduction methods can be applied with new statistical or optimization strategies to improve the clustering of single cells. We will also introduce those more advanced approaches to cluster scRNA-seq transcriptomes in time series data and multiple cell populations and to detect rare cell types. Several software packages developed to support the cluster analysis of scRNA-seq data are also reviewed and experimentally compared to evaluate their performance and efficiency. Finally, we conclude with useful observations and possible future directions in scRNA-seq data analytics.

37370129	2023	Genome biology	Panhematopoietic RNA barcoding enables kinetic measurements of nucleate and anucleate lineages and the activation of myeloid clones following acute platelet depletion.	BACKGROUND: Platelets and erythrocytes constitute over 95% of all hematopoietic stem cell output. However, the clonal dynamics of HSC contribution to these lineages remains largely unexplored. RESULTS: We use lentiviral genetic labeling of mouse hematopoietic stem cells to quantify output from all lineages, nucleate, and anucleate, simultaneously linking these with stem and progenitor cell transcriptomic phenotypes using single-cell RNA-sequencing. We observe dynamic shifts of clonal behaviors through time in same-animal peripheral blood and demonstrate that acute platelet depletion shifts the output of multipotent hematopoietic stem cells to the exclusive production of platelets. Additionally, we observe the emergence of new myeloid-biased clones, which support short- and long-term production of blood cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our approach enables kinetic studies of multi-lineage output in the peripheral blood and transcriptional heterogeneity of individual hematopoietic stem cells. Our results give a unique insight into hematopoietic stem cell reactivation upon platelet depletion and of clonal dynamics in both steady state and under stress.
34874992	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	SCRIP: an accurate simulator for single-cell RNA sequencing data.	MOTIVATION: Recent advancements in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have enabled time-efficient transcriptome profiling in individual cells. To optimize sequencing protocols and develop reliable analysis methods for various application scenarios, solid simulation methods for scRNA-seq data are required. However, due to the noisy nature of scRNA-seq data, currently available simulation methods cannot sufficiently capture and simulate important properties of real data, especially the biological variation. In this study, we developed scRNA-seq information producer (SCRIP), a novel simulator for scRNA-seq that is accurate and enables simulation of bursting kinetics. RESULTS: Compared to existing simulators, SCRIP showed a significantly higher accuracy of stimulating key data features, including mean-variance dependency in all experiments. SCRIP also outperformed other methods in recovering cell-cell distances. The application of SCRIP in evaluating differential expression analysis methods showed that edgeR outperformed other examined methods in differential expression analyses, and ZINB-WaVE improved the AUC at high dropout rates. Collectively, this study provides the research community with a rigorous tool for scRNA-seq data simulation. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SCRIP.

39965935	2025	Genome research	Long-read single-cell RNA sequencing enables the study of cancer subclone-specific genotypes and phenotypes in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.	Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors are effective for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) due to BTK's role in B cell survival and proliferation. Treatment resistance is most commonly caused by the emergence of the hallmark BTK (C481S) mutation that inhibits drug binding. In this study, we aimed to investigate cancer subclones harboring a BTK (C481S) mutation and identify cells with co-occurring CLL driver mutations. In addition, we sought to determine whether BTK-mutated subclones exhibit distinct transcriptomic behavior when compared to other cancer subclones. To achieve these goals, we use scBayes, which integrates bulk DNA sequencing and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to genotype individual cells for subclone-defining mutations. Although the most common approach for scRNA-seq includes short-read sequencing, transcript coverage is limited due to the vast majority of the reads being concentrated at the priming end of the transcript. Here, we utilized MAS-seq, a long-read scRNA-seq technology, to substantially increase transcript coverage and expand the set of informative mutations to link cells to cancer subclones in six CLL patients who acquired BTK (C481S) mutations during BTK inhibitor treatment. In two patients who developed two independent BTK-mutated subclones, we find that most BTK-mutated cells have an additional CLL driver gene mutation. When examining subclone-specific gene expression, we find that in one patient, BTK-mutated subclones are transcriptionally distinct from the rest of the malignant B cell population with an overexpression of CLL-relevant genes.
36975610	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Con-AAE: contrastive cycle adversarial autoencoders for single-cell multi-omics alignment and integration.	MOTIVATION: We have entered the multi-omics era and can measure cells from different aspects. Hence, we can get a more comprehensive view by integrating or matching data from different spaces corresponding to the same object. However, it is particularly challenging in the single-cell multi-omics scenario because such data are very sparse with extremely high dimensions. Though some techniques can be used to measure scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq simultaneously, the data are usually highly noisy due to the limitations of the experimental environment. RESULTS: To promote single-cell multi-omics research, we overcome the above challenges, proposing a novel framework, contrastive cycle adversarial autoencoders, which can align and integrate single-cell RNA-seq data and single-cell ATAC-seq data. Con-AAE can efficiently map the above data with high sparsity and noise from different spaces to a coordinated subspace, where alignment and integration tasks can be easier. We demonstrate its advantages on several datasets. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Zenodo link: https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/368779433. github: https://github.com/kakarotcq/Con-AAE.
41071814	2025	PLoS computational biology	Differential equation modeling of cell population dynamics in skeletal muscle regeneration from single-cell transcriptomic data.	Skeletal muscle regeneration is a complex process orchestrated by diverse cell populations within a dynamic niche. In response to muscle damage and intercellular signaling, these cells undergo cell fate and migration decisions including quiescence, activation, proliferation, differentiation, infiltration, apoptosis, and exfiltration. The emergence of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) studies of muscle regeneration offers a significant opportunity to refine models of regeneration and enhance our understanding of cellular interactions. To better understand how crosstalk between cell types governs cell fate decisions and cell population dynamics, we developed a novel non-linear ordinary differential equation model guided by scRNA-seq data. Our model consists of 9 variables and 17 parameters, capturing the dynamics of key myogenic lineage and immune cell types. We calibrated time-series scRNA-seq data to units of cells per cubic millimeter of tissue and fit our model's parameters to capture the observed dynamics, validating on an independent time series. The model successfully captures key features of regeneration dynamics, particularly after incorporating a novel regulatory interaction between M2 macrophages and satellite cells that has been hypothesized in the literature. Our model lays a foundation for future computational explorations of muscle regeneration, modeling of disease conditions, and in silico testing of therapeutic strategies.
38426327	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	scAMAC: self-supervised clustering of scRNA-seq data based on adaptive multi-scale autoencoder.	Cluster assignment is vital to analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to understand high-level biological processes. Deep learning-based clustering methods have recently been widely used in scRNA-seq data analysis. However, existing deep models often overlook the interconnections and interactions among network layers, leading to the loss of structural information within the network layers. Herein, we develop a new self-supervised clustering method based on an adaptive multi-scale autoencoder, called scAMAC. The self-supervised clustering network utilizes the Multi-Scale Attention mechanism to fuse the feature information from the encoder, hidden and decoder layers of the multi-scale autoencoder, which enables the exploration of cellular correlations within the same scale and captures deep features across different scales. The self-supervised clustering network calculates the membership matrix using the fused latent features and optimizes the clustering network based on the membership matrix. scAMAC employs an adaptive feedback mechanism to supervise the parameter updates of the multi-scale autoencoder, obtaining a more effective representation of cell features. scAMAC not only enables cell clustering but also performs data reconstruction through the decoding layer. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that scAMAC is superior to several advanced clustering and imputation methods in both data clustering and reconstruction. In addition, scAMAC is beneficial for downstream analysis, such as cell trajectory inference. Our scAMAC model codes are freely available at https://github.com/yancy2024/scAMAC.
35920332	2022	Nucleic acids research	Intratracheally administered LNA gapmer antisense oligonucleotides induce robust gene silencing in mouse lung fibroblasts.	The lung is a complex organ with various cell types having distinct roles. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) have been studied in the lung, but it has been challenging to determine their effectiveness in each cell type due to the lack of appropriate analytical methods. We employed three distinct approaches to study silencing efficacy within different cell types. First, we used lineage markers to identify cell types in flow cytometry, and simultaneously measured ASO-induced silencing of cell-surface proteins CD47 or CD98. Second, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to measure silencing efficacy in distinct cell types; to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time scRNA-seq has been applied to measure the efficacy of oligonucleotide therapeutics. In both approaches, fibroblasts were the most susceptible to locally delivered ASOs, with significant silencing also in endothelial cells. Third, we confirmed that the robust silencing in fibroblasts is broadly applicable by silencing two targets expressed mainly in fibroblasts, Mfap4 and Adam33. Across independent approaches, we demonstrate that intratracheally administered LNA gapmer ASOs robustly induce gene silencing in lung fibroblasts. ASO-induced gene silencing in fibroblasts was durable, lasting 4-8 weeks after a single dose. Thus, lung fibroblasts are well aligned with ASOs as therapeutics.
37474808	2023	Nature methods	Voltage-Seq: all-optical postsynaptic connectome-guided single-cell transcriptomics.	Understanding the routing of neuronal information requires the functional characterization of connections. Neuronal projections recruit large postsynaptic ensembles with distinct postsynaptic response types (PRTs). PRT is typically probed by low-throughput whole-cell electrophysiology and is not a selection criterion for single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). To overcome these limitations and target neurons based on specific PRTs for soma harvesting and subsequent scRNA-seq, we created Voltage-Seq. We established all-optical voltage imaging and recorded the PRT of 8,347 neurons in the mouse periaqueductal gray (PAG) evoked by the optogenetic activation of ventromedial hypothalamic (VMH) terminals. PRTs were classified and spatially resolved in the entire VMH-PAG connectome. We built an onsite analysis tool named VoltView to navigate soma harvesting towards target PRTs guided by a classifier that used the VMH-PAG connectome database as a reference. We demonstrated Voltage-seq by locating VMH-driven gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic neurons in the PAG, guided solely by the onsite classification in VoltView.
34857027	2021	Genome biology	DropletQC: improved identification of empty droplets and damaged cells in single-cell RNA-seq data.	"BACKGROUND: Advances in droplet-based single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) have dramatically increased throughput, allowing tens of thousands of cells to be routinely sequenced in a single experiment. In addition to cells, droplets capture cell-free ""ambient"" RNA predominantly caused by lysis of cells during sample preparation. Samples with high ambient RNA concentration can create challenges in accurately distinguishing cell-containing droplets and droplets containing ambient RNA. Current methods to separate these groups often retain a significant number of droplets that do not contain cells or empty droplets. Additionally, there are currently no methods available to detect droplets containing damaged cells, which comprise partially lysed cells, the original source of the ambient RNA. RESULTS: Here, we describe DropletQC, a new method that is able to detect empty droplets, damaged, and intact cells, and accurately distinguish them from one another. This approach is based on a novel quality control metric, the nuclear fraction, which quantifies for each droplet the fraction of RNA originating from unspliced, nuclear pre-mRNA. We demonstrate how DropletQC provides a powerful extension to existing computational methods for identifying empty droplets such as EmptyDrops. CONCLUSIONS: We implement DropletQC as an R package, which can be easily integrated into existing single-cell analysis workflows."
36821425	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	CLAIRE: contrastive learning-based batch correction framework for better balance between batch mixing and preservation of cellular heterogeneity.	MOTIVATION: Integration of growing single-cell RNA sequencing datasets helps better understand cellular identity and function. The major challenge for integration is removing batch effects while preserving biological heterogeneities. Advances in contrastive learning have inspired several contrastive learning-based batch correction methods. However, existing contrastive-learning-based methods exhibit noticeable ad hoc trade-off between batch mixing and preservation of cellular heterogeneities (mix-heterogeneity trade-off). Therefore, a deliberate mix-heterogeneity trade-off is expected to yield considerable improvements in scRNA-seq dataset integration. RESULTS: We develop a novel contrastive learning-based batch correction framework, CIAIRE, which achieves superior mix-heterogeneity trade-off. The key contributions of CLAIRE are proposal of two complementary strategies: construction strategy and refinement strategy, to improve the appropriateness of positive pairs. Construction strategy dynamically generates positive pairs by augmenting inter-batch mutual nearest neighbors (MNN) with intra-batch k-nearest neighbors (KNN), which improves the coverage of positive pairs for the whole distribution of shared cell types between batches. Refinement strategy aims to automatically reduce the potential false positive pairs from the construction strategy, which resorts to the memory effect of deep neural networks. We demonstrate that CLAIRE possesses superior mix-heterogeneity trade-off over existing contrastive learning-based methods. Benchmark results on six real datasets also show that CLAIRE achieves the best integration performance against eight state-of-the-art methods. Finally, comprehensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of CLAIRE. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code and data used in this study can be found in https://github.com/CSUBioGroup/CLAIRE-release.

41134910	2025	PLoS computational biology	Improved gene regulatory network inference from single cell data with dropout augmentation.	"A major challenge in working with single-cell RNA sequencing data is the prevalence of ""dropout,"" when some transcripts' expression values are erroneously not captured. Addressing this issue, which produces zero-inflated count data, is crucial for many downstream data analyses including the inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs). In this paper, we introduce two novel contributions. First, we propose Dropout Augmentation (DA), a simple but effective model regularization method to improve resilience to zero inflation in single-cell data by augmenting the data with synthetic dropout events. DA offers a new perspective to solve the ""dropout"" problem beyond imputation. Second, we present DAZZLE, a stabilized and robust version of the autoencoder-based structure equation model for GRN inference using the DA concept. Benchmark experiments illustrate the improved performance and increased stability of the proposed DAZZLE model over existing approaches. The practical application of the DAZZLE model on a longitudinal mouse microglia dataset containing over 15,000 genes illustrates its ability to handle real-world single cell data with minimal gene filtration. The improved robustness and stability of DAZZLE make it a practical and valuable addition to the toolkit for GRN inference from single-cell data. Finally, we propose that Dropout Augmentation may have wider applications beyond the GRN-inference problem. Project website: https://bcb.cs.tufts.edu/DAZZLE."
35043143	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	Network-based integrative analysis of single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic data for cell types.	Advances in single-cell biotechnologies simultaneously generate the transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles at cell levels, providing an opportunity for investigating cell fates. Although great efforts have been devoted to either of them, the integrative analysis of single-cell multi-omics data is really limited because of the heterogeneity, noises and sparsity of single-cell profiles. In this study, a network-based integrative clustering algorithm (aka NIC) is present for the identification of cell types by fusing the parallel single-cell transcriptomic (scRNA-seq) and epigenomic profiles (scATAC-seq or DNA methylation). To avoid heterogeneity of multi-omics data, NIC automatically learns the cell-cell similarity graphs, which transforms the fusion of multi-omics data into the analysis of multiple networks. Then, NIC employs joint non-negative matrix factorization to learn the shared features of cells by exploiting the structure of learned cell-cell similarity networks, providing a better way to characterize the features of cells. The graph learning and integrative analysis procedures are jointly formulated as an optimization problem, and then the update rules are derived. Thirteen single-cell multi-omics datasets from various tissues and organisms are adopted to validate the performance of NIC, and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of various measurements. The proposed algorithm provides an effective strategy for the integrative analysis of single-cell multi-omics data (The software is coded using Matlab, and is freely available for academic https://github.com/xkmaxidian/NIC ).
31873215	2020	Nature biotechnology	Highly multiplexed single-cell RNA-seq by DNA oligonucleotide tagging of cellular proteins.	We describe a universal sample multiplexing method for single-cell RNA sequencing in which fixed cells are chemically labeled by attaching identifying DNA oligonucleotides to cellular proteins. Analysis of a 96-plex perturbation experiment revealed changes in cell population structure and transcriptional states that cannot be discerned from bulk measurements, establishing an efficient method for surveying cell populations from large experiments or clinical samples with the depth and resolution of single-cell RNA sequencing.
41240059	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	CluVar: clustering of variants using autoencoder for inferring cancer subclones from single cell RNA sequencing data.	Tumor tissues are composed of malignant subclones with diverse genetic profiles. Reconstructing the evolutionary trajectory of these subclones is crucial for understanding how tumors acquire malignant traits. However, current approaches to subclonal tree reconstruction are limited either by their reliance on single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq) that involve a small number of cells and thus yield low-resolution results, or using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, which despite including larger cell populations, remain susceptible to bias from high dropout rates and technical noise. Here, we introduce CluVar, an autoencoder-based framework for inferring the phylogeny of cancer subclones from scRNA-seq data using mutation profile analysis. To address the extensive missing variant information inherent in scRNA-seq datasets, CluVar incorporates a customized loss function and multiple hidden layers optimized for clustering. CluVar demonstrated superior performance in reconstructing phylogenetic trees of cancer subclones under a range of erroneous conditions. When applied to cancer scRNA-seq data, the phylogenetic tree predicted using CluVar aligned well with the transcriptomic profiles. These findings highlight its utility for tracing evolutionary trajectories and identifying novel variants associated with cancer progression.
36646931	2023	Nature biotechnology	Droplet-based transcriptome profiling of individual synapses.	Synapses are crucial structures that mediate signal transmission between neurons in complex neural circuits and display considerable morphological and electrophysiological heterogeneity. So far we still lack a high-throughput method to profile the molecular heterogeneity among individual synapses. In the present study, we develop a droplet-based single-cell (sc) total-RNA-sequencing platform, called Multiple-Annealing-and-Tailing-based Quantitative scRNA-seq in Droplets, for transcriptome profiling of individual neurites, primarily composed of synaptosomes. In the synaptosome transcriptome, or 'synaptome', profiling of both mouse and human brain samples, we detect subclusters among synaptosomes that are associated with neuronal subtypes and characterize the landscape of transcript splicing that occurs within synapses. We extend synaptome profiling to synaptopathy in an Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model and discover AD-associated synaptic gene expression changes that cannot be detected by single-nucleus transcriptome profiling. Overall, our results show that this platform provides a high-throughput, single-synaptosome transcriptome profiling tool that will facilitate future discoveries in neuroscience.
40073230	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	AJGM: joint learning of heterogeneous gene networks with adaptive graphical model.	MOTIVATION: Inferring gene networks provides insights into biological pathways and functional relationships among genes. When gene expression samples exhibit heterogeneity, they may originate from unknown subtypes, prompting the utilization of mixture Gaussian graphical model (GGM) for simultaneous subclassification and gene network inference. However, this method overlooks the heterogeneity of network relationships across subtypes and does not sufficiently emphasize shared relationships. Additionally, GGM assumes data follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution, which is often not the case with zero-inflated scRNA-seq data. RESULTS: We propose an Adaptive Joint Graphical Model (AJGM) for estimating multiple gene networks from single-cell or bulk data with unknown heterogeneity. In AJGM, an overall network is introduced to capture relationships shared by all samples. The model establishes connections between the subtype networks and the overall network through adaptive weights, enabling it to focus more effectively on gene relationships shared across all networks, thereby enhancing the accuracy of network estimation. On synthetic data, the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in terms of sample classification and network inference, particularly excelling in the identification of shared relationships. Applying this method to gene expression data from triple-negative breast cancer confirms known gene pathways and hub genes, while also revealing novel biological insights. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The Python code and demonstrations of the proposed approaches are available at https://github.com/yyytim/AJGM, and the software is archived in Zenodo with DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.14740972.
32976581	2021	Nucleic acids research	STAB: a spatio-temporal cell atlas of the human brain.	The human brain is the most complex organ consisting of billions of neuronal and non-neuronal cells that are organized into distinct anatomical and functional regions. Elucidating the cellular and transcriptome architecture underlying the brain is crucial for understanding brain functions and brain disorders. Thanks to the single-cell RNA sequencing technologies, it is becoming possible to dissect the cellular compositions of the brain. Although great effort has been made to explore the transcriptome architecture of the human brain, a comprehensive database with dynamic cellular compositions and molecular characteristics of the human brain during the lifespan is still not available. Here, we present STAB (a Spatio-Temporal cell Atlas of the human Brain), a database consists of single-cell transcriptomes across multiple brain regions and developmental periods. Right now, STAB contains single-cell gene expression profiling of 42 cell subtypes across 20 brain regions and 11 developmental periods. With STAB, the landscape of cell types and their regional heterogeneity and temporal dynamics across the human brain can be clearly seen, which can help to understand both the development of the normal human brain and the etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. STAB is available at http://stab.comp-sysbio.org.
34103073	2021	Genome biology	BUTTERFLY: addressing the pooled amplification paradox with unique molecular identifiers in single-cell RNA-seq.	"The incorporation of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) in single-cell RNA-seq assays makes possible the identification of duplicated molecules, thereby facilitating the counting of distinct molecules from sequenced reads. However, we show that the naive removal of duplicates can lead to a bias due to a ""pooled amplification paradox,"" and we propose an improved quantification method based on unseen species modeling. Our correction called BUTTERFLY uses a zero truncated negative binomial estimator implemented in the kallisto bustools workflow. We demonstrate its efficacy across cell types and genes and show that in some cases it can invert the relative abundance of genes."
35253834	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Supervised capacity preserving mapping: a clustering guided visualization method for scRNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: The rapid development of scRNA-seq technologies enables us to explore the transcriptome at the cell level on a large scale. Recently, various computational methods have been developed to analyze the scRNAseq data, such as clustering and visualization. However, current visualization methods, including t-SNE and UMAP, are challenged by the limited accuracy of rendering the geometric relationship of populations with distinct functional states. Most visualization methods are unsupervised, leaving out information from the clustering results or given labels. This leads to the inaccurate depiction of the distances between the bona fide functional states. In particular, UMAP and t-SNE are not optimal to preserve the global geometric structure. They may result in a contradiction that clusters with near distance in the embedded dimensions are in fact further away in the original dimensions. Besides, UMAP and t-SNE cannot track the variance of clusters. Through the embedding of t-SNE and UMAP, the variance of a cluster is not only associated with the true variance but also is proportional to the sample size. RESULTS: We present supCPM, a robust supervised visualization method, which separates different clusters, preserves the global structure and tracks the cluster variance. Compared with six visualization methods using synthetic and real datasets, supCPM shows improved performance than other methods in preserving the global geometric structure and data variance. Overall, supCPM provides an enhanced visualization pipeline to assist the interpretation of functional transition and accurately depict population segregation.

31647529	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	PlanExp: intuitive integration of complex RNA-seq datasets with planarian omics resources.	MOTIVATION: There is an increasing amount of transcriptomic and genomic data available for planarians with the advent of both traditional and single-cell RNA sequencing technologies. Therefore, exploring, visualizing and making sense of all these data in order to understand planarian regeneration and development can be challenging. RESULTS: In this work, we present PlanExp, a web-application to explore and visualize gene expression data from different RNA-seq experiments (both traditional and single-cell RNA-seq) for the planaria Schmidtea mediterranea. PlanExp provides tools for creating different interactive plots, such as heatmaps, scatterplots, etc. and links them with the current sequence annotations both at the genome and the transcript level thanks to its integration with the PlanNET web application. PlanExp also provides a full gene/protein network editor, a prediction of genetic interactions from single-cell RNA-seq data, and a network expression mapper that will help researchers to close the gap between systems biology and planarian regeneration.

33482885	2021	Genome biology	MicroExonator enables systematic discovery and quantification of microexons across mouse embryonic development.	BACKGROUND: Microexons, exons that are </= 30 nucleotides, are a highly conserved and dynamically regulated set of cassette exons. They have key roles in nervous system development and function, as evidenced by recent results demonstrating the impact of microexons on behaviour and cognition. However, microexons are often overlooked due to the difficulty of detecting them using standard RNA-seq aligners. RESULTS: Here, we present MicroExonator, a novel pipeline for reproducible de novo discovery and quantification of microexons. We process 289 RNA-seq datasets from eighteen mouse tissues corresponding to nine embryonic and postnatal stages, providing the most comprehensive survey of microexons available for mice. We detect 2984 microexons, 332 of which are differentially spliced throughout mouse embryonic brain development, including 29 that are not present in mouse transcript annotation databases. Unsupervised clustering of microexons based on their inclusion patterns segregates brain tissues by developmental time, and further analysis suggests a key function for microexons in axon growth and synapse formation. Finally, we analyse single-cell RNA-seq data from the mouse visual cortex, and for the first time, we report differential inclusion between neuronal subpopulations, suggesting that some microexons could be cell type-specific. CONCLUSIONS: MicroExonator facilitates the investigation of microexons in transcriptome studies, particularly when analysing large volumes of data. As a proof of principle, we use MicroExonator to analyse a large collection of both mouse bulk and single-cell RNA-seq datasets. The analyses enabled the discovery of previously uncharacterized microexons, and our study provides a comprehensive microexon inclusion catalogue during mouse development.
29630061	2018	Nature methods	FateID infers cell fate bias in multipotent progenitors from single-cell RNA-seq data.	To understand stem cell differentiation along multiple lineages, it is necessary to resolve heterogeneous cellular states and the ancestral relationships between them. We developed a robotic miniaturized CEL-Seq2 implementation to carry out deep single-cell RNA-seq of  approximately 2,000 mouse hematopoietic progenitors enriched for lymphoid lineages, and used an improved clustering algorithm, RaceID3, to identify cell types. To resolve subtle transcriptome differences indicative of lineage biases, we developed FateID, an iterative supervised learning algorithm for the probabilistic quantification of cell fate bias in progenitor populations. Here we used FateID to delineate domains of fate bias and enable the derivation of high-resolution differentiation trajectories, thereby revealing a common progenitor population of B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, which we validated by in vitro differentiation assays. We expect that FateID will improve understanding of the process of cell fate choice in complex multi-lineage differentiation systems.
34308480	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	scAdapt: virtual adversarial domain adaptation network for single cell RNA-seq data classification across platforms and species.	In single cell analyses, cell types are conventionally identified based on expressions of known marker genes, whose identifications are time-consuming and irreproducible. To solve this issue, many supervised approaches have been developed to identify cell types based on the rapid accumulation of public datasets. However, these approaches are sensitive to batch effects or biological variations since the data distributions are different in cross-platforms or species predictions. In this study, we developed scAdapt, a virtual adversarial domain adaptation network, to transfer cell labels between datasets with batch effects. scAdapt used both the labeled source and unlabeled target data to train an enhanced classifier and aligned the labeled source centroids and pseudo-labeled target centroids to generate a joint embedding. The scAdapt was demonstrated to outperform existing methods for classification in simulated, cross-platforms, cross-species, spatial transcriptomic and COVID-19 immune datasets. Further quantitative evaluations and visualizations for the aligned embeddings confirm the superiority in cell mixing and the ability to preserve discriminative cluster structure present in the original datasets.
39504481	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	scDTL: enhancing single-cell RNA-seq imputation through deep transfer learning with bulk cell information.	The increasing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data enable researchers to explore cellular heterogeneity and gene expression profiles, offering a high-resolution view of the transcriptome at the single-cell level. However, the dropout events, which are often present in scRNA-seq data, remaining challenges for downstream analysis. Although a number of studies have been developed to recover single-cell expression profiles, their performance may be hindered due to not fully exploring the inherent relations between genes. To address the issue, we propose scDTL, a deep transfer learning based approach for scRNA-seq data imputation by harnessing the bulk RNA-sequencing information. We firstly employ a denoising autoencoder trained on bulk RNA-seq data as the initial imputation model, and then leverage a domain adaptation framework that transfers the knowledge learned by the bulk imputation model to scRNA-seq learning task. In addition, scDTL employs a parallel operation with a 1D U-Net denoising model to provide gene representations of varying granularity, capturing both coarse and fine features of the scRNA-seq data. Finally, we utilize a cross-channel attention mechanism to fuse the features learned from the transferred bulk imputation model and U-Net model. In the evaluation, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that scDTL could outperform other state-of-the-art methods in the quantitative comparison and downstream analyses.
32591762	2020	Nature biotechnology	COVID-19 severity correlates with airway epithelium-immune cell interactions identified by single-cell analysis.	To investigate the immune response and mechanisms associated with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on nasopharyngeal and bronchial samples from 19 clinically well-characterized patients with moderate or critical disease and from five healthy controls. We identified airway epithelial cell types and states vulnerable to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. In patients with COVID-19, epithelial cells showed an average three-fold increase in expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2, which correlated with interferon signals by immune cells. Compared to moderate cases, critical cases exhibited stronger interactions between epithelial and immune cells, as indicated by ligand-receptor expression profiles, and activated immune cells, including inflammatory macrophages expressing CCL2, CCL3, CCL20, CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL10, IL8, IL1B and TNF. The transcriptional differences in critical cases compared to moderate cases likely contribute to clinical observations of heightened inflammatory tissue damage, lung injury and respiratory failure. Our data suggest that pharmacologic inhibition of the CCR1 and/or CCR5 pathways might suppress immune hyperactivation in critical COVID-19.
33305325	2021	Nucleic acids research	Entropy subspace separation-based clustering for noise reduction (ENCORE) of scRNA-seq data.	Single-cell RNA sequencing enables us to characterize the cellular heterogeneity in single cell resolution with the help of cell type identification algorithms. However, the noise inherent in single-cell RNA-sequencing data severely disturbs the accuracy of cell clustering, marker identification and visualization. We propose that clustering based on feature density profiles can distinguish informative features from noise. We named such strategy as 'entropy subspace' separation and designed a cell clustering algorithm called ENtropy subspace separation-based Clustering for nOise REduction (ENCORE) by integrating the 'entropy subspace' separation strategy with a consensus clustering method. We demonstrate that ENCORE performs superiorly on cell clustering and generates high-resolution visualization across 12 standard datasets. More importantly, ENCORE enables identification of group markers with biological significance from a hard-to-separate dataset. With the advantages of effective feature selection, improved clustering, accurate marker identification and high-resolution visualization, we present ENCORE to the community as an important tool for scRNA-seq data analysis to study cellular heterogeneity and discover group markers.
31061481	2019	Nature biotechnology	Determining cell type abundance and expression from bulk tissues with digital cytometry.	Single-cell RNA-sequencing has emerged as a powerful technique for characterizing cellular heterogeneity, but it is currently impractical on large sample cohorts and cannot be applied to fixed specimens collected as part of routine clinical care. We previously developed an approach for digital cytometry, called CIBERSORT, that enables estimation of cell type abundances from bulk tissue transcriptomes. We now introduce CIBERSORTx, a machine learning method that extends this framework to infer cell-type-specific gene expression profiles without physical cell isolation. By minimizing platform-specific variation, CIBERSORTx also allows the use of single-cell RNA-sequencing data for large-scale tissue dissection. We evaluated the utility of CIBERSORTx in multiple tumor types, including melanoma, where single-cell reference profiles were used to dissect bulk clinical specimens, revealing cell-type-specific phenotypic states linked to distinct driver mutations and response to immune checkpoint blockade. We anticipate that digital cytometry will augment single-cell profiling efforts, enabling cost-effective, high-throughput tissue characterization without the need for antibodies, disaggregation or viable cells.
26047807	2015	Genome biology	Scalable microfluidics for single-cell RNA printing and sequencing.	Many important biological questions demand single-cell transcriptomics on a large scale. Hence, new tools are urgently needed for efficient, inexpensive manipulation of RNA from individual cells. We report a simple platform for trapping single-cell lysates in sealed, picoliter microwells capable of printing RNA on glass or capturing RNA on beads. We then develop a scalable technology for genome-wide, single-cell RNA-Seq. Our device generates pooled libraries from hundreds of individual cells with consumable costs of $0.10-$0.20 per cell and includes five lanes for simultaneous experiments. We anticipate that this system will serve as a general platform for single-cell imaging and sequencing.

38709881	2024	Nucleic acids research	SCTC: inference of developmental potential from single-cell transcriptional complexity.	Inferring the developmental potential of single cells from scRNA-Seq data and reconstructing the pseudo-temporal path of cell development are fundamental but challenging tasks in single-cell analysis. Although single-cell transcriptional diversity (SCTD) measured by the number of expressed genes per cell has been widely used as a hallmark of developmental potential, it may lead to incorrect estimation of differentiation states in some cases where gene expression does not decrease monotonously during the development process. In this study, we propose a novel metric called single-cell transcriptional complexity (SCTC), which draws on insights from the economic complexity theory and takes into account the sophisticated structure information of scRNA-Seq count matrix. We show that SCTC characterizes developmental potential more accurately than SCTD, especially in the early stages of development where cells typically have lower diversity but higher complexity than those in the later stages. Based on the SCTC, we provide an unsupervised method for accurate, robust, and transferable inference of single-cell pseudotime. Our findings suggest that the complexity emerging from the interplay between cells and genes determines the developmental potential, providing new insights into the understanding of biological development from the perspective of complexity theory.
24299736	2014	Genome research	From single-cell to cell-pool transcriptomes: stochasticity in gene expression and RNA splicing.	Single-cell RNA-seq mammalian transcriptome studies are at an early stage in uncovering cell-to-cell variation in gene expression, transcript processing and editing, and regulatory module activity. Despite great progress recently, substantial challenges remain, including discriminating biological variation from technical noise. Here we apply the SMART-seq single-cell RNA-seq protocol to study the reference lymphoblastoid cell line GM12878. By using spike-in quantification standards, we estimate the absolute number of RNA molecules per cell for each gene and find significant variation in total mRNA content: between 50,000 and 300,000 transcripts per cell. We directly measure technical stochasticity by a pool/split design and find that there are significant differences in expression between individual cells, over and above technical variation. Specific gene coexpression modules were preferentially expressed in subsets of individual cells, including one enriched for mRNA processing and splicing factors. We assess cell-to-cell variation in alternative splicing and allelic bias and report evidence of significant differences in splice site usage that exceed splice variation in the pool/split comparison. Finally, we show that transcriptomes from small pools of 30-100 cells approach the information content and reproducibility of contemporary RNA-seq from large amounts of input material. Together, our results define an experimental and computational path forward for analyzing gene expression in rare cell types and cell states.
31510649	2019	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Minnow: a principled framework for rapid simulation of dscRNA-seq data at the read level.	SUMMARY: With the advancements of high-throughput single-cell RNA-sequencing protocols, there has been a rapid increase in the tools available to perform an array of analyses on the gene expression data that results from such studies. For example, there exist methods for pseudo-time series analysis, differential cell usage, cell-type detection RNA-velocity in single cells, etc. Most analysis pipelines validate their results using known marker genes (which are not widely available for all types of analysis) and by using simulated data from gene-count-level simulators. Typically, the impact of using different read-alignment or unique molecular identifier (UMI) deduplication methods has not been widely explored. Assessments based on simulation tend to start at the level of assuming a simulated count matrix, ignoring the effect that different approaches for resolving UMI counts from the raw read data may produce. Here, we present minnow, a comprehensive sequence-level droplet-based single-cell RNA-sequencing (dscRNA-seq) experiment simulation framework. Minnow accounts for important sequence-level characteristics of experimental scRNA-seq datasets and models effects such as polymerase chain reaction amplification, cellular barcodes (CB) and UMI selection and sequence fragmentation and sequencing. It also closely matches the gene-level ambiguity characteristics that are observed in real scRNA-seq experiments. Using minnow, we explore the performance of some common processing pipelines to produce gene-by-cell count matrices from droplet-bases scRNA-seq data, demonstrate the effect that realistic levels of gene-level sequence ambiguity can have on accurate quantification and show a typical use-case of minnow in assessing the output generated by different quantification pipelines on the simulated experiment. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
41139925	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	scDETECT: a novel statistical model accounting for cell type correlation in single-cell RNA-seq differential expression analysis.	Differential expression (DE) is one of the most important analyses in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq). Due to similarity of cell types, the DE states often have strong correlation among different cell types. Existing methods perform DE analysis for each cell type separately and ignore such correlation, leading to low accuracy, and statistical power. We develop single cell Differential Expression TEst with Cell Type correlation (scDETECT), a novel statistical method, for scRNA-seq DE analysis accounting for the cell type correlations. scDETECT implements a Bayesian hierarchical model to incorporate the cell type correlations into the modeling of the gene expression, and then the DE genes are called based on the derived posterior probabilities. Simulation and real data studies show that scDETECT significantly improves the accuracy and statistical power compared with existing methods.
40963109	2025	Genome biology	Predicting the structural impact of human alternative splicing.	BACKGROUND: Protein structure prediction with neural networks is a powerful new method for linking protein sequence, structure, and function, but structures have generally been predicted for only a single isoform of each gene, neglecting splice variants. To investigate the structural implications of alternative splicing, we use AlphaFold2 to predict the structures of more than 11,000 human isoforms. We employ multiple metrics to identify splicing-induced structural alterations, including template matching score, secondary structure composition, surface charge distribution, radius of gyration, accessibility of post-translational modification sites, and structure-based function prediction. RESULTS: We identify examples of how alternative splicing induces clear changes in each of these properties. Structural similarity between isoforms largely correlates with degree of sequence identity, but we identify a subset of isoforms with low structural similarity despite high sequence similarity. Exon skipping and alternative last exons tend to increase the surface charge and radius of gyration. Splicing also buries or exposes numerous post-translational modification sites, most notably among the isoforms of BAX. Functional prediction identifies numerous functional differences between isoforms of the same gene, with loss of function compared to the reference predominating. Finally, we use single-cell RNA-seq data from the Tabula Sapiens to determine the cell types in which each structure is expressed. CONCLUSIONS: Our work represents an important resource for studying the structure and function of splice isoforms across the cell types of the human body.

34815310	2021	Genome research	Human and rat skeletal muscle single-nuclei multi-omic integrative analyses nominate causal cell types, regulatory elements, and SNPs for complex traits.	Skeletal muscle accounts for the largest proportion of human body mass, on average, and is a key tissue in complex diseases and mobility. It is composed of several different cell and muscle fiber types. Here, we optimize single-nucleus ATAC-seq (snATAC-seq) to map skeletal muscle cell-specific chromatin accessibility landscapes in frozen human and rat samples, and single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) to map cell-specific transcriptomes in human. We additionally perform multi-omics profiling (gene expression and chromatin accessibility) on human and rat muscle samples. We capture type I and type II muscle fiber signatures, which are generally missed by existing single-cell RNA-seq methods. We perform cross-modality and cross-species integrative analyses on 33,862 nuclei and identify seven cell types ranging in abundance from 59.6% to 1.0% of all nuclei. We introduce a regression-based approach to infer cell types by comparing transcription start site-distal ATAC-seq peaks to reference enhancer maps and show consistency with RNA-based marker gene cell type assignments. We find heterogeneity in enrichment of genetic variants linked to complex phenotypes from the UK Biobank and diabetes genome-wide association studies in cell-specific ATAC-seq peaks, with the most striking enrichment patterns in muscle mesenchymal stem cells ( approximately 3.5% of nuclei). Finally, we overlay these chromatin accessibility maps on GWAS data to nominate causal cell types, SNPs, transcription factor motifs, and target genes for type 2 diabetes signals. These chromatin accessibility profiles for human and rat skeletal muscle cell types are a useful resource for nominating causal GWAS SNPs and cell types.
37770710	2023	Nature methods	A new Bayesian factor analysis method improves detection of genes and biological processes affected by perturbations in single-cell CRISPR screening.	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) screening coupled with single-cell RNA sequencing has emerged as a powerful tool to characterize the effects of genetic perturbations on the whole transcriptome at a single-cell level. However, due to its sparsity and complex structure, analysis of single-cell CRISPR screening data is challenging. In particular, standard differential expression analysis methods are often underpowered to detect genes affected by CRISPR perturbations. We developed a statistical method for such data, called guided sparse factor analysis (GSFA). GSFA infers latent factors that represent coregulated genes or gene modules; by borrowing information from these factors, it infers the effects of genetic perturbations on individual genes. We demonstrated through extensive simulation studies that GSFA detects perturbation effects with much higher power than state-of-the-art methods. Using single-cell CRISPR data from human CD8(+) T cells and neural progenitor cells, we showed that GSFA identified biologically relevant gene modules and specific genes affected by CRISPR perturbations, many of which were missed by existing methods, providing new insights into the functions of genes involved in T cell activation and neurodevelopment.
37740957	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	MuDCoD: multi-subject community detection in personalized dynamic gene networks from single-cell RNA sequencing.	MOTIVATION: With the wide availability of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) technology, population-scale scRNA-seq datasets across multiple individuals and time points are emerging. While the initial investigations of these datasets tend to focus on standard analysis of clustering and differential expression, leveraging the power of scRNA-seq data at the personalized dynamic gene co-expression network level has the potential to unlock subject and/or time-specific network-level variation, which is critical for understanding phenotypic differences. Community detection from co-expression networks of multiple time points or conditions has been well-studied; however, none of the existing settings included networks from multiple subjects and multiple time points simultaneously. To address this, we develop Multi-subject Dynamic Community Detection (MuDCoD) for multi-subject community detection in personalized dynamic gene networks from scRNA-seq. MuDCoD builds on the spectral clustering framework and promotes information sharing among the networks of the subjects as well as networks at different time points. It clusters genes in the personalized dynamic gene networks and reveals gene communities that are variable or shared not only across time but also among subjects. RESULTS: Evaluation and benchmarking of MuDCoD against existing approaches reveal that MuDCoD effectively leverages apparent shared signals among networks of the subjects at individual time points, and performs robustly when there is no or little information sharing among the networks. Applications to population-scale scRNA-seq datasets of human-induced pluripotent stem cells during dopaminergic neuron differentiation and CD4+ T cell activation indicate that MuDCoD enables robust inference for identifying time-varying personalized gene modules. Our results illustrate how personalized dynamic community detection can aid in the exploration of subject-specific biological processes that vary across time. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: MuDCoD is publicly available at https://github.com/bo1929/MuDCoD as a Python package. Implementation includes simulation and real-data experiments together with extensive documentation.
35165449	2022	Nature methods	Deterministic scRNA-seq captures variation in intestinal crypt and organoid composition.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) approaches have transformed our ability to resolve cellular properties across systems, but are currently tailored toward large cell inputs (>1,000 cells). This renders them inefficient and costly when processing small, individual tissue samples, a problem that tends to be resolved by loading bulk samples, yielding confounded mosaic cell population read-outs. Here, we developed a deterministic, mRNA-capture bead and cell co-encapsulation dropleting system, DisCo, aimed at processing low-input samples (<500 cells). We demonstrate that DisCo enables precise particle and cell positioning and droplet sorting control through combined machine-vision and multilayer microfluidics, enabling continuous processing of low-input single-cell suspensions at high capture efficiency (>70%) and at speeds up to 350 cells per hour. To underscore DisCo's unique capabilities, we analyzed 31 individual intestinal organoids at varying developmental stages. This revealed extensive organoid heterogeneity, identifying distinct subtypes including a regenerative fetal-like Ly6a(+) stem cell population that persists as symmetrical cysts, or spheroids, even under differentiation conditions, and an uncharacterized 'gobloid' subtype consisting predominantly of precursor and mature (Muc2(+)) goblet cells. To complement this dataset and to demonstrate DisCo's capacity to process low-input, in vivo-derived tissues, we also analyzed individual mouse intestinal crypts. This revealed the existence of crypts with a compositional similarity to spheroids, which consisted predominantly of regenerative stem cells, suggesting the existence of regenerating crypts in the homeostatic intestine. These findings demonstrate the unique power of DisCo in providing high-resolution snapshots of cellular heterogeneity in small, individual tissues.
34991671	2022	Genome biology	scDALI: modeling allelic heterogeneity in single cells reveals context-specific genetic regulation.	While it is established that the functional impact of genetic variation can vary across cell types and states, capturing this diversity remains challenging. Current studies using bulk sequencing either ignore this heterogeneity or use sorted cell populations, reducing discovery and explanatory power. Here, we develop scDALI, a versatile computational framework that integrates information on cellular states with allelic quantifications of single-cell sequencing data to characterize cell-state-specific genetic effects. We apply scDALI to scATAC-seq profiles from developing F1 Drosophila embryos and scRNA-seq from differentiating human iPSCs, uncovering heterogeneous genetic effects in specific lineages, developmental stages, or cell types.
35040932	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	AlzCode: a platform for multiview analysis of genes related to Alzheimer's disease.	MOTIVATION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex brain disorder with risk genes incompletely identified. The candidate genes are dominantly obtained by computational approaches. In order to obtain biological insights of candidate genes or screen genes for experimental testing, it is essential to assess their relevance to AD. A platform that integrates different types of omics data and approaches would facilitate the analysis of candidate genes and is in great need. RESULTS: We report AlzCode, a platform for multiview analysis of genes related to AD. First, this platform integrates a rich collection of functional genomic data, including expression data of AD samples (gene expression, single-cell RNA-seq data and protein expression), AD-specific biological networks (co-expression networks and functional gene networks), neuropathological and clinical traits (CERAD score, Braak staging score, Clinical Dementia Rating, cognitive function and clinical severity) and general data such as protein-protein interaction, regulatory networks, sequence similarity and miRNA-target interactions. These data provide basis for analyzing genes from different views. Second, the platform integrates multiple approaches designed for the various types of data. We implement functions to analyze both individual genes and gene sets. We also compare AlzCode with two existing platforms for AD analysis, which are Agora and AD Atlas. We pinpoint the features of each platform and highlight their differences. This platform would be valuable to the understanding of AD genetics and pathological mechanisms. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: AlzCode is freely available at: http://www.alzcode.xyz. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

MOTIVATION: Scalable clustering algorithms are needed to analyze millions of cells in single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data. RESULTS: Here, we present an open source python package called FlowGrid that can integrate into the Scanpy workflow to perform clustering on very large scRNA-seq datasets. FlowGrid implements a fast density-based clustering algorithm originally designed for flow cytometry data analysis. We introduce a new automated parameter tuning procedure, and show that FlowGrid can achieve comparable clustering accuracy as state-of-the-art clustering algorithms but at a substantially reduced run time for very large single cell RNA-seq datasets. For example, FlowGrid can complete a one-hour clustering task for one million cells in about five min. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: https://github.com/holab-hku/FlowGrid.

29644996	2018	Nature biotechnology	Simultaneous lineage tracing and cell-type identification using CRISPR-Cas9-induced genetic scars.	A key goal of developmental biology is to understand how a single cell is transformed into a full-grown organism comprising many different cell types. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is commonly used to identify cell types in a tissue or organ. However, organizing the resulting taxonomy of cell types into lineage trees to understand the developmental origin of cells remains challenging. Here we present LINNAEUS (lineage tracing by nuclease-activated editing of ubiquitous sequences)-a strategy for simultaneous lineage tracing and transcriptome profiling in thousands of single cells. By combining scRNA-seq with computational analysis of lineage barcodes, generated by genome editing of transgenic reporter genes, we reconstruct developmental lineage trees in zebrafish larvae, and in heart, liver, pancreas, and telencephalon of adult fish. LINNAEUS provides a systematic approach for tracing the origin of novel cell types, or known cell types under different conditions.
40062616	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Inferring gene regulatory networks from time-series scRNA-seq data via GRANGER causal recurrent autoencoders.	The development of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology provides valuable data resources for inferring gene regulatory networks (GRNs), enabling deeper insights into cellular mechanisms and diseases. While many methods exist for inferring GRNs from static scRNA-seq data, current approaches face challenges in accurately handling time-series scRNA-seq data due to high noise levels and data sparsity. The temporal dimension introduces additional complexity by requiring models to capture dynamic changes, increasing sensitivity to noise, and exacerbating data sparsity across time points. In this study, we introduce GRANGER, an unsupervised deep learning-based method that integrates multiple advanced techniques, including a recurrent variational autoencoder, GRANGER causality, sparsity-inducing penalties, and negative binomial (NB)-based loss functions, to infer GRNs. GRANGER was evaluated using multiple popular benchmarking datasets, where it demonstrated superior performance compared to eight well-known GRN inference methods. The integration of a NB-based loss function and sparsity-inducing penalties in GRANGER significantly enhanced its capacity to address dropout noise and sparsity in scRNA-seq data. Additionally, GRANGER exhibited robustness against high levels of dropout noise. We applied GRANGER to scRNA-seq data from the whole mouse brain obtained through the BRAIN Initiative project and identified GRNs for five transcription regulators: E2f7, Gbx1, Sox10, Prox1, and Onecut2, which play crucial roles in diverse brain cell types. The inferred GRNs not only recalled many known regulatory relationships but also revealed sets of novel regulatory interactions with functional potential. These findings demonstrate that GRANGER is a highly effective tool for real-world applications in discovering novel gene regulatory relationships.

35879607	2022	Nature methods	Directed evolution of adeno-associated virus for efficient gene delivery to microglia.	As the resident immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS), microglia orchestrate immune responses and dynamically sculpt neural circuits in the CNS. Microglial dysfunction and mutations of microglia-specific genes have been implicated in many diseases of the CNS. Developing effective and safe vehicles for transgene delivery into microglia will facilitate the studies of microglia biology and microglia-associated disease mechanisms. Here, we report the discovery of adeno-associated virus (AAV) variants that mediate efficient in vitro and in vivo microglial transduction via directed evolution of the AAV capsid protein. These AAV-cMG and AAV-MG variants are capable of delivering various genetic payloads into microglia with high efficiency, and enable sufficient transgene expression to support fluorescent labeling, Ca(2+) and neurotransmitter imaging and genome editing in microglia in vivo. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing shows that the AAV-MG variants mediate in vivo transgene delivery without inducing microglia immune activation. These AAV variants should facilitate the use of various genetically encoded sensors and effectors in the study of microglia-related biology.
33355230	2021	Genome research	Transcript assembly improves expression quantification of transposable elements in single-cell RNA-seq data.	Transposable elements (TEs) are an integral part of the host transcriptome. TE-containing noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) show considerable tissue specificity and play important roles during development, including stem cell maintenance and cell differentiation. Recent advances in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) revolutionized cell type-specific gene expression analysis. However, effective scRNA-seq quantification tools tailored for TEs are lacking, limiting our ability to dissect TE expression dynamics at single-cell resolution. To address this issue, we established a TE expression quantification pipeline that is compatible with scRNA-seq data generated across multiple technology platforms. We constructed TE-containing ncRNA references using bulk RNA-seq data and showed that quantifying TE expression at the transcript level effectively reduces noise. As proof of principle, we applied this strategy to mouse embryonic stem cells and successfully captured the expression profile of endogenous retroviruses in single cells. We further expanded our analysis to scRNA-seq data from early stages of mouse embryogenesis. Our results illustrated the dynamic TE expression at preimplantation stages and revealed 146 TE-containing ncRNA transcripts with substantial tissue specificity during gastrulation and early organogenesis.
34508354	2022	Nucleic acids research	scAPAdb: a comprehensive database of alternative polyadenylation at single-cell resolution.	Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is a widespread regulatory mechanism of transcript diversification in eukaryotes, which is increasingly recognized as an important layer for eukaryotic gene expression. Recent studies based on single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) have revealed cell-to-cell heterogeneity in APA usage and APA dynamics across different cell types in various tissues, biological processes and diseases. However, currently available APA databases were all collected from bulk 3'-seq and/or RNA-seq data, and no existing database has provided APA information at single-cell resolution. Here, we present a user-friendly database called scAPAdb (http://www.bmibig.cn/scAPAdb), which provides a comprehensive and manually curated atlas of poly(A) sites, APA events and poly(A) signals at the single-cell level. Currently, scAPAdb collects APA information from > 360 scRNA-seq experiments, covering six species including human, mouse and several other plant species. scAPAdb also provides batch download of data, and users can query the database through a variety of keywords such as gene identifier, gene function and accession number. scAPAdb would be a valuable and extendable resource for the study of cell-to-cell heterogeneity in APA isoform usages and APA-mediated gene regulation at the single-cell level under diverse cell types, tissues and species.
39800876	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Deep learning in integrating spatial transcriptomics with other modalities.	Spatial transcriptomics technologies have been extensively applied in biological research, enabling the study of transcriptome while preserving the spatial context of tissues. Paired with spatial transcriptomics data, platforms often provide histology and (or) chromatin images, which capture cellular morphology and chromatin organization. Additionally, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from matching tissues often accompany spatial data, offering a transcriptome-wide gene expression profile of individual cells. Integrating such additional data from other modalities can effectively enhance spatial transcriptomics data, and, conversely, spatial transcriptomics data can supplement scRNA-seq with spatial information. Moreover, the rapid development of spatial multi-omics technology has spurred the demand for the integration of spatial multi-omics data to present a more detailed molecular landscape within tissues. Numerous deep learning (DL) methods have been developed for integrating spatial transcriptomics with other modalities. However, a comprehensive review of DL approaches for integrating spatial transcriptomics data with other modalities remains absent. In this study, we systematically review the applications of DL in integrating spatial transcriptomics data with other modalities. We first delineate the DL techniques applied in this integration and the key tasks involved. Next, we detail these methods and categorize them based on integrated modality and key task. Furthermore, we summarize the integration strategies of these integration methods. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future directions in integrating spatial transcriptomics with other modalities, aiming to facilitate the development of robust computational methods that more comprehensively exploit multimodal information.
35136933	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	Improving bulk RNA-seq classification by transferring gene signature from single cells in acute myeloid leukemia.	The advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies enable the characterization of transcriptomic profiles at the cellular level and demonstrate great promise in bulk sample analysis thereby offering opportunities to transfer gene signature from scRNA-seq to bulk data. However, the gene expression signatures identified from single cells are typically inapplicable to bulk RNA-seq data due to the profiling differences of distinct sequencing technologies. Here, we propose single-cell pair-wise gene expression (scPAGE), a novel method to develop single-cell gene pair signatures (scGPSs) that were beneficial to bulk RNA-seq classification to transfer knowledge across platforms. PAGE was adopted to tackle the challenge of profiling differences. We applied the method to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and identified the scGPS from mouse scRNA-seq that allowed discriminating between AML and control cells. The scGPS was validated in bulk RNA-seq datasets and demonstrated better performance (average area under the curve [AUC] = 0.96) than the conventional gene expression strategies (average AUC$\le$ 0.88) suggesting its potential in disclosing the molecular mechanism of AML. The scGPS also outperformed its bulk counterpart, which highlighted the benefit of gene signature transfer. Furthermore, we confirmed the utility of scPAGE in sepsis as an example of other disease scenarios. scPAGE leveraged the advantages of single-cell profiles to enhance the analysis of bulk samples revealing great potential of transferring knowledge from single-cell to bulk transcriptome studies.
30080856	2018	PLoS computational biology	A new dynamic correlation algorithm reveals novel functional aspects in single cell and bulk RNA-seq data.	Dynamic correlations are pervasive in high-throughput data. Large numbers of gene pairs can change their correlation patterns in response to observed/unobserved changes in physiological states. Finding changes in correlation patterns can reveal important regulatory mechanisms. Currently there is no method that can effectively detect global dynamic correlation patterns in a dataset. Given the challenging nature of the problem, the currently available methods use genes as surrogate measurements of physiological states, which cannot faithfully represent true underlying biological signals. In this study we develop a new method that directly identifies strong latent dynamic correlation signals from the data matrix, named DCA: Dynamic Correlation Analysis. At the center of the method is a new metric for the identification of pairs of variables that are highly likely to be dynamically correlated, without knowing the underlying physiological states that govern the dynamic correlation. We validate the performance of the method with extensive simulations. We applied the method to three real datasets: a single cell RNA-seq dataset, a bulk RNA-seq dataset, and a microarray gene expression dataset. In all three datasets, the method reveals novel latent factors with clear biological meaning, bringing new insights into the data.
36849204	2023	Genome research	Complex hierarchical structures in single-cell genomics data unveiled by deep hyperbolic manifold learning.	With the advances in single-cell sequencing techniques, numerous analytical methods have been developed for delineating cell development. However, most are based on Euclidean space, which would distort the complex hierarchical structure of cell differentiation. Recently, methods acting on hyperbolic space have been proposed to visualize hierarchical structures in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data and have been proven to be superior to methods acting on Euclidean space. However, these methods have fundamental limitations and are not optimized for the highly sparse single-cell count data. To address these limitations, we propose scDHMap, a model-based deep learning approach to visualize the complex hierarchical structures of scRNA-seq data in low-dimensional hyperbolic space. The evaluations on extensive simulation and real experiments show that scDHMap outperforms existing dimensionality-reduction methods in various common analytical tasks as needed for scRNA-seq data, including revealing trajectory branches, batch correction, and denoising the count matrix with high dropout rates. In addition, we extend scDHMap to visualize single-cell ATAC-seq data.

39570626	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	OneSC: a computational platform for recapitulating cell state transitions.	"MOTIVATION: Computational modeling of cell state transitions has been a great interest of many in the field of developmental biology, cancer biology, and cell fate engineering because it enables performing perturbation experiments in silico more rapidly and cheaply than could be achieved in a lab. Recent advancements in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) allow the capture of high-resolution snapshots of cell states as they transition along temporal trajectories. Using these high-throughput datasets, we can train computational models to generate in silico ""synthetic"" cells that faithfully mimic the temporal trajectories. RESULTS: Here we present OneSC, a platform that can simulate cell state transitions using systems of stochastic differential equations govern by a regulatory network of core transcription factors (TFs). Different from many current network inference methods, OneSC prioritizes on generating Boolean network that produces faithful cell state transitions and terminal cell states that mimic real biological systems. Applying OneSC to real data, we inferred a core TF network using a mouse myeloid progenitor scRNA-seq dataset and showed that the dynamical simulations of that network generate synthetic single-cell expression profiles that faithfully recapitulate the four myeloid differentiation trajectories going into differentiated cell states (erythrocytes, megakaryocytes, granulocytes, and monocytes). Finally, through the in silico perturbations of the mouse myeloid progenitor core network, we showed that OneSC can accurately predict cell fate decision biases of TF perturbations that closely match with previous experimental observations. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: OneSC is implemented as a Python package on GitHub (https://github.com/CahanLab/oneSC) and on Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/records/14052421)."
29317474	2018	Genome research	Reconstructing differentiation networks and their regulation from time series single-cell expression data.	Generating detailed and accurate organogenesis models using single-cell RNA-seq data remains a major challenge. Current methods have relied primarily on the assumption that descendant cells are similar to their parents in terms of gene expression levels. These assumptions do not always hold for in vivo studies, which often include infrequently sampled, unsynchronized, and diverse cell populations. Thus, additional information may be needed to determine the correct ordering and branching of progenitor cells and the set of transcription factors (TFs) that are active during advancing stages of organogenesis. To enable such modeling, we have developed a method that learns a probabilistic model that integrates expression similarity with regulatory information to reconstruct the dynamic developmental cell trajectories. When applied to mouse lung developmental data, the method accurately distinguished different cell types and lineages. Existing and new experimental data validated the ability of the method to identify key regulators of cell fate.
41105729	2025	PLoS computational biology	Stabilized marker gene identification and functional annotation from single-cell transcriptomic data.	With the rapid emergence of single-cell transcriptomics datasets, reproducible marker genes and functional annotation of cell type or state is becoming increasingly important. Conventional methods that rely on differential gene expression (DEG) analysis lack both consistency across datasets and functional annotations of selected markers. Here, we present scSCOPE, an R-based platform that utilizes stabilized LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) feature selection, bootstrapped co-expression networks, and pathway enrichments to identify reproducible and functionally relevant marker genes and associated pathways in scRNAseq datasets. Using 9 scRNAseq datasets from human and mouse immune cells generated by different sequencing technologies, we show that scSCOPE outperforms other conventional methods by automatically identifying cell type-specific marker genes and pathways with the highest consistency across all datasets. scSCOPE's gene co-expression and pathway analyses also provide in-depth molecular insights into the functionality of identified marker genes. We anticipate that scSCOPE will greatly improve cell type annotation and accelerate the design of experimental validation and functional investigations on cell heterogeneity.
29608177	2018	Nature biotechnology	Batch effects in single-cell RNA-sequencing data are corrected by matching mutual nearest neighbors.	Large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data sets that are produced in different laboratories and at different times contain batch effects that may compromise the integration and interpretation of the data. Existing scRNA-seq analysis methods incorrectly assume that the composition of cell populations is either known or identical across batches. We present a strategy for batch correction based on the detection of mutual nearest neighbors (MNNs) in the high-dimensional expression space. Our approach does not rely on predefined or equal population compositions across batches; instead, it requires only that a subset of the population be shared between batches. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared with existing methods by using both simulated and real scRNA-seq data sets. Using multiple droplet-based scRNA-seq data sets, we demonstrate that our MNN batch-effect-correction method can be scaled to large numbers of cells.
37024957	2023	Genome biology	FIPRESCI: droplet microfluidics based combinatorial indexing for massive-scale 5'-end single-cell RNA sequencing.	Single-cell RNA sequencing methods focusing on the 5'-end of transcripts can reveal promoter and enhancer activity and efficiently profile immune receptor repertoire. However, ultra-high-throughput 5'-end single-cell RNA sequencing methods have not been described. We introduce FIPRESCI, 5'-end single-cell combinatorial indexing RNA-Seq, enabling massive sample multiplexing and increasing the throughput of the droplet microfluidics system by over tenfold. We demonstrate FIPRESCI enables the generation of approximately 100,000 single-cell transcriptomes from E10.5 whole mouse embryos in a single-channel experiment, and simultaneous identification of subpopulation differences and T cell receptor signatures of peripheral blood T cells from 12 cancer patients.
41212589	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	A machine learning framework using urinary biomarkers for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma prediction with post hoc validation via single-cell transcriptomics.	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly lethal cancer with a poor prognosis, thus emphasizing the need for early and accurate diagnostic tools. In this study, we propose a comparative study approach to understand how machine learning (ML) modeling using urinary biomarkers combined with demographic data can predict PDAC. The study also utilized a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis to assess and understand gene expressions of included biomarkers. With inclusion of available biomarkers and incorporation of demographic information, we employed different approaches for preprocessing techniques, normalization approaches, ML techniques, and deep learning (DL) approaches to provide a comprehensive prediction model. The scRNA-seq approach also highlighted the significance of the urinary biomarkers from the pancreatic single-cell sample. Based on this analysis, the marker was identified as one of the top three most highly expressed genes in PDAC tissues. The predictive modeling approach was conducted for both binary and multiclass classification using both ML and DL approaches. The comparative analysis using all included parameter combinations produced modeling settings, and among these parameters, the DL modeling approach using binary classification outperformed the other approaches by achieving 91% accuracy. This framework provided insights that highlighted the critical role of demographic data and potential approaches to include such features in the model without impacting the predictive accuracy. Future work will focus on examining the framework using different datasets, integrating additional omics data, and exploring advanced DL architectures to further improve predictive performances.
32375897	2020	Genome biology	Single-cell RNA-seq with spike-in cells enables accurate quantification of cell-specific drug effects in pancreatic islets.	BACKGROUND: Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) is emerging as a powerful tool to dissect cell-specific effects of drug treatment in complex tissues. This application requires high levels of precision, robustness, and quantitative accuracy-beyond those achievable with existing methods for mainly qualitative single-cell analysis. Here, we establish the use of standardized reference cells as spike-in controls for accurate and robust dissection of single-cell drug responses. RESULTS: We find that contamination by cell-free RNA can constitute up to 20% of reads in human primary tissue samples, and we show that the ensuing biases can be removed effectively using a novel bioinformatics algorithm. Applying our method to both human and mouse pancreatic islets treated ex vivo, we obtain an accurate and quantitative assessment of cell-specific drug effects on the transcriptome. We observe that FOXO inhibition induces dedifferentiation of both alpha and beta cells, while artemether treatment upregulates insulin and other beta cell marker genes in a subset of alpha cells. In beta cells, dedifferentiation and insulin repression upon artemether treatment occurs predominantly in mouse but not in human samples. CONCLUSIONS: This new method for quantitative, error-correcting, scRNA-seq data normalization using spike-in reference cells helps clarify complex cell-specific effects of pharmacological perturbations with single-cell resolution and high quantitative accuracy.
40240003	2025	Nucleic acids research	Cell-cycle dependence of bursty gene expression: insights from fitting mechanistic models to single-cell RNA-seq data.	Bursty gene expression is characterized by two intuitive parameters, burst frequency and burst size, the cell-cycle dependence of which has not been extensively profiled at the transcriptome level. In this study, we estimate the burst parameters per allele in the G1 and G2/M cell-cycle phases for thousands of mouse genes by fitting mechanistic models of gene expression to messenger RNA count data, obtained by sequencing of single cells whose cell-cycle position has been inferred using a deep-learning method. We find that upon DNA replication, the median burst frequency approximately halves, while the burst size remains mostly unchanged. Genome-wide distributions of the burst parameter ratios between the G2/M and G1 phases are broad, indicating substantial heterogeneity in transcriptional regulation. We also observe a significant negative correlation between the burst frequency and size ratios, suggesting that regulatory processes do not independently control the burst parameters. We show that to accurately estimate the burst parameter ratios, mechanistic models must explicitly account for gene copy number variation and extrinsic noise due to the coupling of transcription to cell age across the cell cycle, but corrections for technical noise due to imperfect capture of RNA molecules in sequencing experiments are less critical.
35420135	2022	Nucleic acids research	MarcoPolo: a method to discover differentially expressed genes in single-cell RNA-seq data without depending on prior clustering.	The standard analysis pipeline for single-cell RNA-seq data consists of sequential steps initiated by clustering the cells. An innate limitation of this pipeline is that an imperfect clustering result can irreversibly affect the succeeding steps. For example, there can be cell types not well distinguished by clustering because they largely share the global structure, such as the anterior primitive streak and mid primitive streak cells. If one searches differentially expressed genes (DEGs) solely based on clustering, marker genes for distinguishing these types will be missed. Moreover, clustering depends on many parameters and can often be subjective to manual decisions. To overcome these limitations, we propose MarcoPolo, a method that identifies informative DEGs independently of prior clustering. MarcoPolo sorts out genes by evaluating if the distributions are bimodal, if similar expression patterns are observed in other genes, and if the expressing cells are proximal in a low-dimensional space. Using real datasets with FACS-purified cell labels, we demonstrate that MarcoPolo recovers marker genes better than competing methods. Notably, MarcoPolo finds key genes that can distinguish cell types that are not distinguishable by the standard clustering. MarcoPolo is built in a convenient software package that provides analysis results in an HTML file.
39207729	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	CHAI: consensus clustering through similarity matrix integration for cell-type identification.	Several methods have been developed to computationally predict cell-types for single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data. As methods are developed, a common problem for investigators has been identifying the best method they should apply to their specific use-case. To address this challenge, we present CHAI (consensus Clustering tHrough similArIty matrix integratIon for single cell-type identification), a wisdom of crowds approach for scRNAseq clustering. CHAI presents two competing methods which aggregate the clustering results from seven state-of-the-art clustering methods: CHAI-AvgSim and CHAI-SNF. CHAI-AvgSim and CHAI-SNF demonstrate superior performance across several benchmarking datasets. Furthermore, both CHAI methods outperform the most recent consensus clustering method, SAME-clustering. We demonstrate CHAI's practical use case by identifying a leader tumor cell cluster enriched with CDH3. CHAI provides a platform for multiomic integration, and we demonstrate CHAI-SNF to have improved performance when including spatial transcriptomics data. CHAI overcomes previous limitations by incorporating the most recent and top performing scRNAseq clustering algorithms into the aggregation framework. It is also an intuitive and easily customizable R package where users may add their own clustering methods to the pipeline, or down-select just the ones they want to use for the clustering aggregation. This ensures that as more advanced clustering algorithms are developed, CHAI will remain useful to the community as a generalized framework. CHAI is available as an open source R package on GitHub: https://github.com/lodimk2/chai.
39985444	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	AsaruSim: a single-cell and spatial RNA-Seq Nanopore long-reads simulation workflow.	MOTIVATION: The combination of long-read sequencing technologies like Oxford Nanopore with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) assays enables the detailed exploration of transcriptomic complexity, including isoform detection and quantification, by capturing full-length cDNAs. However, challenges remain, including the lack of advanced simulation tools that can effectively mimic the unique complexities of scRNAseq long-read datasets. Such tools are essential for the evaluation and optimization of isoform detection methods dedicated to single-cell long-read studies. RESULTS: We developed AsaruSim, a workflow that simulates synthetic single-cell long-read Nanopore datasets, closely mimicking real experimental data. AsaruSim employs a multi-step process that includes the creation of a synthetic count matrix, generation of perfect reads, optional PCR amplification, introduction of sequencing errors, and comprehensive quality control reporting. Applied to a dataset of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, AsaruSim accurately reproduced experimental read characteristics. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code and full documentation are available at https://github.com/GenomiqueENS/AsaruSim.
28379368	2017	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	SCODE: an efficient regulatory network inference algorithm from single-cell RNA-Seq during differentiation.	MOTIVATION: The analysis of RNA-Seq data from individual differentiating cells enables us to reconstruct the differentiation process and the degree of differentiation (in pseudo-time) of each cell. Such analyses can reveal detailed expression dynamics and functional relationships for differentiation. To further elucidate differentiation processes, more insight into gene regulatory networks is required. The pseudo-time can be regarded as time information and, therefore, single-cell RNA-Seq data are time-course data with high time resolution. Although time-course data are useful for inferring networks, conventional inference algorithms for such data suffer from high time complexity when the number of samples and genes is large. Therefore, a novel algorithm is necessary to infer networks from single-cell RNA-Seq during differentiation. RESULTS: In this study, we developed the novel and efficient algorithm SCODE to infer regulatory networks, based on ordinary differential equations. We applied SCODE to three single-cell RNA-Seq datasets and confirmed that SCODE can reconstruct observed expression dynamics. We evaluated SCODE by comparing its inferred networks with use of a DNaseI-footprint based network. The performance of SCODE was best for two of the datasets and nearly best for the remaining dataset. We also compared the runtimes and showed that the runtimes for SCODE are significantly shorter than for alternatives. Thus, our algorithm provides a promising approach for further single-cell differentiation analyses. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The R source code of SCODE is available at https://github.com/hmatsu1226/SCODE. CONTACT: hirotaka.matsumoto@riken.jp. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
38796691	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Benchmarking mapping algorithms for cell-type annotating in mouse brain by integrating single-nucleus RNA-seq and Stereo-seq data.	Limited gene capture efficiency and spot size of spatial transcriptome (ST) data pose significant challenges in cell-type characterization. The heterogeneity and complexity of cell composition in the mammalian brain make it more challenging to accurately annotate ST data from brain. Many algorithms attempt to characterize subtypes of neuron by integrating ST data with single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) or single-cell RNA sequencing. However, assessing the accuracy of these algorithms on Stereo-seq ST data remains unresolved. Here, we benchmarked 9 mapping algorithms using 10 ST datasets from four mouse brain regions in two different resolutions and 24 pseudo-ST datasets from snRNA-seq. Both actual ST data and pseudo-ST data were mapped using snRNA-seq datasets from the corresponding brain regions as reference data. After comparing the performance across different areas and resolutions of the mouse brain, we have reached the conclusion that both robust cell-type decomposition and SpatialDWLS demonstrated superior robustness and accuracy in cell-type annotation. Testing with publicly available snRNA-seq data from another sequencing platform in the cortex region further validated our conclusions. Altogether, we developed a workflow for assessing suitability of mapping algorithm that fits for ST datasets, which can improve the efficiency and accuracy of spatial data annotation.
31294801	2019	Nucleic acids research	Single-Cell Signature Explorer for comprehensive visualization of single cell signatures across scRNA-seq datasets.	The momentum of scRNA-seq datasets prompts for simple and powerful tools exploring their meaningful signatures. Here we present Single-Cell_Signature_Explorer (https://sites.google.com/site/fredsoftwares/products/single-cell-signature-explorer), the first method for qualitative and high-throughput scoring of any gene set-based signature at the single cell level and its visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. By scanning datasets for single or combined signatures, it rapidly maps any multi-gene feature, exemplified here with signatures of cell lineages, biological hallmarks and metabolic pathways in large scRNAseq datasets of human PBMC, melanoma, lung cancer and adult testis.
37864274	2023	Genome biology	Performance of computational algorithms to deconvolve heterogeneous bulk ovarian tumor tissue depends on experimental factors.	BACKGROUND: Single-cell gene expression profiling provides unique opportunities to understand tumor heterogeneity and the tumor microenvironment. Because of cost and feasibility, profiling bulk tumors remains the primary population-scale analytical strategy. Many algorithms can deconvolve these tumors using single-cell profiles to infer their composition. While experimental choices do not change the true underlying composition of the tumor, they can affect the measurements produced by the assay. RESULTS: We generated a dataset of high-grade serous ovarian tumors with paired expression profiles from using multiple strategies to examine the extent to which experimental factors impact the results of downstream tumor deconvolution methods. We find that pooling samples for single-cell sequencing and subsequent demultiplexing has a minimal effect. We identify dissociation-induced differences that affect cell composition, leading to changes that may compromise the assumptions underlying some deconvolution algorithms. We also observe differences across mRNA enrichment methods that introduce additional discrepancies between the two data types. We also find that experimental factors change cell composition estimates and that the impact differs by method. CONCLUSIONS: Previous benchmarks of deconvolution methods have largely ignored experimental factors. We find that methods vary in their robustness to experimental factors. We provide recommendations for methods developers seeking to produce the next generation of deconvolution approaches and for scientists designing experiments using deconvolution to study tumor heterogeneity.
38855914	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	SCSMD: Single Cell Consistent Clustering based on Spectral Matrix Decomposition.	Cluster analysis, a pivotal step in single-cell sequencing data analysis, presents substantial opportunities to effectively unveil the molecular mechanisms underlying cellular heterogeneity and intercellular phenotypic variations. However, the inherent imperfections arise as different clustering algorithms yield diverse estimates of cluster numbers and cluster assignments. This study introduces Single Cell Consistent Clustering based on Spectral Matrix Decomposition (SCSMD), a comprehensive clustering approach that integrates the strengths of multiple methods to determine the optimal clustering scheme. Testing the performance of SCSMD across different distances and employing the bespoke evaluation metric, the methodological selection undergoes validation to ensure the optimal efficacy of the SCSMD. A consistent clustering test is conducted on 15 authentic scRNA-seq datasets. The application of SCSMD to human embryonic stem cell scRNA-seq data successfully identifies known cell types and delineates their developmental trajectories. Similarly, when applied to glioblastoma cells, SCSMD accurately detects pre-existing cell types and provides finer sub-division within one of the original clusters. The results affirm the robust performance of our SCSMD method in terms of both the number of clusters and cluster assignments. Moreover, we have broadened the application scope of SCSMD to encompass larger datasets, thereby furnishing additional evidence of its superiority. The findings suggest that SCSMD is poised for application to additional scRNA-seq datasets and for further downstream analyses.
38940151	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scGrapHiC: deep learning-based graph deconvolution for Hi-C using single cell gene expression.	SUMMARY: Single-cell Hi-C (scHi-C) protocol helps identify cell-type-specific chromatin interactions and sheds light on cell differentiation and disease progression. Despite providing crucial insights, scHi-C data is often underutilized due to the high cost and the complexity of the experimental protocol. We present a deep learning framework, scGrapHiC, that predicts pseudo-bulk scHi-C contact maps using pseudo-bulk scRNA-seq data. Specifically, scGrapHiC performs graph deconvolution to extract genome-wide single-cell interactions from a bulk Hi-C contact map using scRNA-seq as a guiding signal. Our evaluations show that scGrapHiC, trained on seven cell-type co-assay datasets, outperforms typical sequence encoder approaches. For example, scGrapHiC achieves a substantial improvement of 23.2% in recovering cell-type-specific Topologically Associating Domains over the baselines. It also generalizes to unseen embryo and brain tissue samples. scGrapHiC is a novel method to generate cell-type-specific scHi-C contact maps using widely available genomic signals that enables the study of cell-type-specific chromatin interactions. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The GitHub link: https://github.com/rsinghlab/scGrapHiC contains the source code of scGrapHiC and associated scripts to preprocess publicly available datasets to produce the results and visualizations we have discuss in this manuscript.
40537825	2025	Genome biology	scExtract: leveraging large language models for fully automated single-cell RNA-seq data annotation and prior-informed multi-dataset integration.	Single-cell RNA sequencing has revolutionized cellular heterogeneity research, but analyzing the abundance of unannotated public datasets remains challenging. We present scExtract, a framework leveraging large language models to automate scRNA-seq data analysis from preprocessing to annotation and integration. scExtract extracts information from research articles to guide data processing, outperforming existing reference transfer methods in benchmarks. We introduce scanorama-prior and cellhint-prior, which incorporate prior annotation information for improved batch correction while preserving biological diversities. We demonstrate scExtract's utility by integrating 14 datasets to create a comprehensive human skin atlas of 440,000 cells.
34623390	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scMRA: a robust deep learning method to annotate scRNA-seq data with multiple reference datasets.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) has been widely used to resolve cellular heterogeneity. After collecting scRNA-seq data, the natural next step is to integrate the accumulated data to achieve a common ontology of cell types and states. Thus, an effective and efficient cell-type identification method is urgently needed. Meanwhile, high-quality reference data remain a necessity for precise annotation. However, such tailored reference data are always lacking in practice. To address this, we aggregated multiple datasets into a meta-dataset on which annotation is conducted. Existing supervised or semi-supervised annotation methods suffer from batch effects caused by different sequencing platforms, the effect of which increases in severity with multiple reference datasets. RESULTS: Herein, a robust deep learning-based single-cell Multiple Reference Annotator (scMRA) is introduced. In scMRA, a knowledge graph is constructed to represent the characteristics of cell types in different datasets, and a graphic convolutional network serves as a discriminator based on this graph. scMRA keeps intra-cell-type closeness and the relative position of cell types across datasets. scMRA is remarkably powerful at transferring knowledge from multiple reference datasets, to the unlabeled target domain, thereby gaining an advantage over other state-of-the-art annotation methods in multi-reference data experiments. Furthermore, scMRA can remove batch effects. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use multiple insufficient reference datasets to annotate target data, and it is, comparatively, the best annotation method for multiple scRNA-seq datasets. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: An implementation of scMRA is available from https://github.com/ddb-qiwang/scMRA-torch. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
35241832	2022	Nature methods	The SpliZ generalizes 'percent spliced in' to reveal regulated splicing at single-cell resolution.	Detecting single-cell-regulated splicing from droplet-based technologies is challenging. Here, we introduce the splicing Z score (SpliZ), an annotation-free statistical method to detect regulated splicing in single-cell RNA sequencing. We applied the SpliZ to human lung cells, discovering hundreds of genes with cell-type-specific splicing patterns including ones with potential implications for basic and translational biology.
39285487	2024	Genome biology	ESCHR: a hyperparameter-randomized ensemble approach for robust clustering across diverse datasets.	Clustering is widely used for single-cell analysis, but current methods are limited in accuracy, robustness, ease of use, and interpretability. To address these limitations, we developed an ensemble clustering method that outperforms other methods at hard clustering without the need for hyperparameter tuning. It also performs soft clustering to characterize continuum-like regions and quantify clustering uncertainty, demonstrated here by mapping the connectivity and intermediate transitions between MNIST handwritten digits and between hypothalamic tanycyte subpopulations. This hyperparameter-randomized ensemble approach improves the accuracy, robustness, ease of use, and interpretability of single-cell clustering, and may prove useful in other fields as well.
31845960	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scTIM: seeking cell-type-indicative marker from single cell RNA-seq data by consensus optimization.	MOTIVATION: Single cell RNA-seq data offers us new resource and resolution to study cell type identity and its conversion. However, data analyses are challenging in dealing with noise, sparsity and poor annotation at single cell resolution. Detecting cell-type-indicative markers is promising to help denoising, clustering and cell type annotation. RESULTS: We developed a new method, scTIM, to reveal cell-type-indicative markers. scTIM is based on a multi-objective optimization framework to simultaneously maximize gene specificity by considering gene-cell relationship, maximize gene's ability to reconstruct cell-cell relationship and minimize gene redundancy by considering gene-gene relationship. Furthermore, consensus optimization is introduced for robust solution. Experimental results on three diverse single cell RNA-seq datasets show scTIM's advantages in identifying cell types (clustering), annotating cell types and reconstructing cell development trajectory. Applying scTIM to the large-scale mouse cell atlas data identifies critical markers for 15 tissues as 'mouse cell marker atlas', which allows us to investigate identities of different tissues and subtle cell types within a tissue. scTIM will serve as a useful method for single cell RNA-seq data mining. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: scTIM is freely available at https://github.com/Frank-Orwell/scTIM. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
31584606	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	bayNorm: Bayesian gene expression recovery, imputation and normalization for single-cell RNA-sequencing data.	MOTIVATION: Normalization of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data is a prerequisite to their interpretation. The marked technical variability, high amounts of missing observations and batch effect typical of scRNA-seq datasets make this task particularly challenging. There is a need for an efficient and unified approach for normalization, imputation and batch effect correction. RESULTS: Here, we introduce bayNorm, a novel Bayesian approach for scaling and inference of scRNA-seq counts. The method's likelihood function follows a binomial model of mRNA capture, while priors are estimated from expression values across cells using an empirical Bayes approach. We first validate our assumptions by showing this model can reproduce different statistics observed in real scRNA-seq data. We demonstrate using publicly available scRNA-seq datasets and simulated expression data that bayNorm allows robust imputation of missing values generating realistic transcript distributions that match single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization measurements. Moreover, by using priors informed by dataset structures, bayNorm improves accuracy and sensitivity of differential expression analysis and reduces batch effect compared with other existing methods. Altogether, bayNorm provides an efficient, integrated solution for global scaling normalization, imputation and true count recovery of gene expression measurements from scRNA-seq data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The R package 'bayNorm' is publishd on bioconductor at https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/bayNorm.html. The code for analyzing data in this article is available at https://github.com/WT215/bayNorm_papercode. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
39406498	2024	Genome research	Theoretical framework for the difference of two negative binomial distributions and its application in comparative analysis of sequencing data.	High-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies have been instrumental in investigating biological questions at the bulk and single-cell levels. Comparative analysis of two HTS data sets often relies on testing the statistical significance for the difference of two negative binomial distributions (DOTNB). Although negative binomial distributions are well studied, the theoretical results for DOTNB remain largely unexplored. Here, we derive basic analytical results for DOTNB and examine its asymptotic properties. As a state-of-the-art application of DOTNB, we introduce DEGage, a computational method for detecting differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in scRNA-seq data. DEGage calculates the mean of the sample-wise differences of gene expression levels as the test statistic and determines significant differential expression by computing the P-value with DOTNB. Extensive validation using simulated and real scRNA-seq data sets demonstrates that DEGage outperforms five popular DEG analysis tools: DEGseq2, DEsingle, edgeR, Monocle3, and scDD. DEGage is robust against high dropout levels and exhibits superior sensitivity when applied to balanced and imbalanced data sets, even with small sample sizes. We utilize DEGage to analyze prostate cancer scRNA-seq data sets and identify marker genes for 17 cell types. Furthermore, we apply DEGage to scRNA-seq data sets of mouse neurons with and without fear memory and reveal eight potential memory-related genes overlooked in previous analyses. The theoretical results and supporting software for DOTNB can be widely applied to comparative analyses of dispersed count data in HTS and broad research questions.
24141493	2014	Nature methods	Quantitative assessment of single-cell RNA-sequencing methods.	Interest in single-cell whole-transcriptome analysis is growing rapidly, especially for profiling rare or heterogeneous populations of cells. We compared commercially available single-cell RNA amplification methods with both microliter and nanoliter volumes, using sequence from bulk total RNA and multiplexed quantitative PCR as benchmarks to systematically evaluate the sensitivity and accuracy of various single-cell RNA-seq approaches. We show that single-cell RNA-seq can be used to perform accurate quantitative transcriptome measurement in individual cells with a relatively small number of sequencing reads and that sequencing large numbers of single cells can recapitulate bulk transcriptome complexity.
38975891	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Characterizing efficient feature selection for single-cell expression analysis.	Unsupervised feature selection is a critical step for efficient and accurate analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data. Previous benchmarks used two different criteria to compare feature selection methods: (i) proportion of ground-truth marker genes included in the selected features and (ii) accuracy of cell clustering using ground-truth cell types. Here, we systematically compare the performance of 11 feature selection methods for both criteria. We first demonstrate the discordance between these criteria and suggest using the latter. We then compare the distribution of selected genes in their means between feature selection methods. We show that lowly expressed genes exhibit seriously high coefficients of variation and are mostly excluded by high-performance methods. In particular, high-deviation- and high-expression-based methods outperform the widely used in Seurat package in clustering cells and data visualization. We further show they also enable a clear separation of the same cell type from different tissues as well as accurate estimation of cell trajectories.
36734596	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scBGEDA: deep single-cell clustering analysis via a dual denoising autoencoder with bipartite graph ensemble clustering.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is an increasingly popular technique for transcriptomic analysis of gene expression at the single-cell level. Cell-type clustering is the first crucial task in the analysis of scRNA-seq data that facilitates accurate identification of cell types and the study of the characteristics of their transcripts. Recently, several computational models based on a deep autoencoder and the ensemble clustering have been developed to analyze scRNA-seq data. However, current deep autoencoders are not sufficient to learn the latent representations of scRNA-seq data, and obtaining consensus partitions from these feature representations remains under-explored. RESULTS: To address this challenge, we propose a single-cell deep clustering model via a dual denoising autoencoder with bipartite graph ensemble clustering called scBGEDA, to identify specific cell populations in single-cell transcriptome profiles. First, a single-cell dual denoising autoencoder network is proposed to project the data into a compressed low-dimensional space and that can learn feature representation via explicit modeling of synergistic optimization of the zero-inflated negative binomial reconstruction loss and denoising reconstruction loss. Then, a bipartite graph ensemble clustering algorithm is designed to exploit the relationships between cells and the learned latent embedded space by means of a graph-based consensus function. Multiple comparison experiments were conducted on 20 scRNA-seq datasets from different sequencing platforms using a variety of clustering metrics. The experimental results indicated that scBGEDA outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on these datasets, and also demonstrated its scalability to large-scale scRNA-seq datasets. Moreover, scBGEDA was able to identify cell-type specific marker genes and provide functional genomic analysis by quantifying the influence of genes on cell clusters, bringing new insights into identifying cell types and characterizing the scRNA-seq data from different perspectives. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code of scBGEDA is available at https://github.com/wangyh082/scBGEDA. The software and the supporting data can be downloaded from https://figshare.com/articles/software/scBGEDA/19657911.

30357387	2019	Nucleic acids research	ArrayExpress update - from bulk to single-cell expression data.	ArrayExpress (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress) is an archive of functional genomics data from a variety of technologies assaying functional modalities of a genome, such as gene expression or promoter occupancy. The number of experiments based on sequencing technologies, in particular RNA-seq experiments, has been increasing over the last few years and submissions of sequencing data have overtaken microarray experiments in the last 12 months. Additionally, there is a significant increase in experiments investigating single cells, rather than bulk samples, known as single-cell RNA-seq. To accommodate these trends, we have substantially changed our submission tool Annotare which, along with raw and processed data, collects all metadata necessary to interpret these experiments. Selected datasets are re-processed and loaded into our sister resource, the value-added Expression Atlas (and its component Single Cell Expression Atlas), which not only enables users to interpret the data easily but also serves as a test for data quality. With an increasing number of studies that combine different assay modalities (multi-omics experiments), a new more general archival resource the BioStudies Database has been developed, which will eventually supersede ArrayExpress. Data submissions will continue unchanged; all existing ArrayExpress data will be incorporated into BioStudies and the existing accession numbers and application programming interfaces will be maintained.
28092691	2017	Nature methods	Effective detection of variation in single-cell transcriptomes using MATQ-seq.	The quantification of transcriptional variation in single cells, particularly within the same cell population, is currently limited by the low sensitivity and high technical noise of single-cell RNA-seq assays. We report multiple annealing and dC-tailing-based quantitative single-cell RNA-seq (MATQ-seq), a highly sensitive and quantitative method for single-cell sequencing of total RNA. By systematically determining technical noise, we show that MATQ-seq captures genuine biological variation between whole transcriptomes of single cells.
39237934	2024	Genome biology	DeepKINET: a deep generative model for estimating single-cell RNA splicing and degradation rates.	Messenger RNA splicing and degradation are critical for gene expression regulation, the abnormality of which leads to diseases. Previous methods for estimating kinetic rates have limitations, assuming uniform rates across cells. DeepKINET is a deep generative model that estimates splicing and degradation rates at single-cell resolution from scRNA-seq data.

31623682	2019	Genome biology	Dissociation of solid tumor tissues with cold active protease for single-cell RNA-seq minimizes conserved collagenase-associated stress responses.	BACKGROUND: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool for studying complex biological systems, such as tumor heterogeneity and tissue microenvironments. However, the sources of technical and biological variation in primary solid tumor tissues and patient-derived mouse xenografts for scRNA-seq are not well understood. RESULTS: We use low temperature (6  degrees C) protease and collagenase (37  degrees C) to identify the transcriptional signatures associated with tissue dissociation across a diverse scRNA-seq dataset comprising 155,165 cells from patient cancer tissues, patient-derived breast cancer xenografts, and cancer cell lines. We observe substantial variation in standard quality control metrics of cell viability across conditions and tissues. From the contrast between tissue protease dissociation at 37  degrees C or 6  degrees C, we observe that collagenase digestion results in a stress response. We derive a core gene set of 512 heat shock and stress response genes, including FOS and JUN, induced by collagenase (37  degrees C), which are minimized by dissociation with a cold active protease (6  degrees C). While induction of these genes was highly conserved across all cell types, cell type-specific responses to collagenase digestion were observed in patient tissues. CONCLUSIONS: The method and conditions of tumor dissociation influence cell yield and transcriptome state and are both tissue- and cell-type dependent. Interpretation of stress pathway expression differences in cancer single-cell studies, including components of surface immune recognition such as MHC class I, may be especially confounded. We define a core set of 512 genes that can assist with the identification of such effects in dissociated scRNA-seq experiments.
25517037	2014	Genome biology	The importance of study design for detecting differentially abundant features in high-throughput experiments.	High-throughput assays, such as RNA-seq, to detect differential abundance are widely used. Variable performance across statistical tests, normalizations, and conditions leads to resource wastage and reduced sensitivity. EDDA represents a first, general design tool for RNA-seq, Nanostring, and metagenomic analysis, that rationally selects tests, predicts performance, and plans experiments to minimize resource wastage. Case studies highlight EDDA's ability to model single-cell RNA-seq, suggesting ways to reduce sequencing costs up to five-fold and improving metagenomic biomarker detection through improved test selection. EDDA's novel mode-based normalization for detecting differential abundance improves robustness by 10% to 20% and precision by up to 140%.
33026066	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Gene regulation inference from single-cell RNA-seq data with linear differential equations and velocity inference.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers new possibilities to infer gene regulatory network (GRNs) for biological processes involving a notion of time, such as cell differentiation or cell cycles. It also raises many challenges due to the destructive measurements inherent to the technology. RESULTS: In this work, we propose a new method named GRISLI for de novo GRN inference from scRNA-seq data. GRISLI infers a velocity vector field in the space of scRNA-seq data from profiles of individual cells, and models the dynamics of cell trajectories with a linear ordinary differential equation to reconstruct the underlying GRN with a sparse regression procedure. We show on real data that GRISLI outperforms a recently proposed state-of-the-art method for GRN reconstruction from scRNA-seq data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The MATLAB code of GRISLI is available at: https://github.com/PCAubin/GRISLI. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
40095604	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	MulNet: a scalable framework for reconstructing intra- and intercellular signaling networks from bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data.	Gene expression involves complex interactions between DNA, RNA, proteins, and small molecules. However, most existing molecular networks are built on limited interaction types, resulting in a fragmented understanding of gene regulation. Here, we present MulNet, a framework that organizes diverse molecular interactions underlying gene expression data into a scalable multilayer network. Additionally, MulNet can accurately identify gene modules and key regulators within this network. When applied across diverse cancer datasets, MulNet outperformed state-of-the-art methods in identifying biologically relevant modules. MulNet analysis of RNA-seq data from colon cancer revealed numerous well-established cancer regulators and a promising new therapeutic target, miR-8485, along with several downstream pathways it governs to inhibit tumor growth. MulNet analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data from head and neck cancer revealed intricate communication networks between fibroblasts and malignant cells mediated by transcription factors and cytokines. Overall, MulNet enables high-resolution reconstruction of intra- and intercellular communication from both bulk and single-cell data. The MulNet code and application are available at https://github.com/free1234hm/MulNet.
40981522	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	CLUEY enables knowledge-guided clustering and cell type detection from single-cell omics data.	MOTIVATION: Clustering is a fundamental task in single-cell omics data analysis and can significantly impact downstream analyses and biological interpretations. The standard approach involves grouping cells based on their gene expression profiles, followed by annotating each cluster to a cell type using marker genes. However, the number of cell types detected by different clustering methods can vary substantially due to several factors, including the dimension reduction method used and the choice of parameters of the chosen clustering algorithm. These discrepancies can lead to subjective interpretations in downstream analyses, particularly in manual cell type annotation. RESULTS: To address these challenges, we propose CLUEY, a knowledge-guided framework for cell type detection and clustering of single-cell omics data. CLUEY integrates prior biological knowledge into the clustering process, providing guidance on the optimal number of clusters and enhancing the interpretability of results. We apply CLUEY to both unimodal (e.g. scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq) and multimodal datasets (e.g. CITE-seq, SHARE-seq) and demonstrate its effectiveness in providing biologically meaningful clustering outcomes. These results highlight CLUEY on providing the much-needed guidance in clustering analyses of single-cell omics data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: CLUEY package is freely available from https://github.com/SydneyBioX/CLUEY.
36715342	2023	Nucleic acids research	Key transcription factors influence the epigenetic landscape to regulate retinal cell differentiation.	How the diverse neural cell types emerge from multipotent neural progenitor cells during central nervous system development remains poorly understood. Recent scRNA-seq studies have delineated the developmental trajectories of individual neural cell types in many neural systems including the neural retina. Further understanding of the formation of neural cell diversity requires knowledge about how the epigenetic landscape shifts along individual cell lineages and how key transcription factors regulate these changes. In this study, we dissect the changes in the epigenetic landscape during early retinal cell differentiation by scATAC-seq and identify globally the enhancers, enriched motifs, and potential interacting transcription factors underlying the cell state/type specific gene expression in individual lineages. Using CUT&Tag, we further identify the enhancers bound directly by four key transcription factors, Otx2, Atoh7, Pou4f2 and Isl1, including those dependent on Atoh7, and uncover the sequential and combinatorial interactions of these factors with the epigenetic landscape to control gene expression along individual retinal cell lineages such as retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Our results reveal a general paradigm in which transcription factors collaborate and compete to regulate the emergence of distinct retinal cell types such as RGCs from multipotent retinal progenitor cells (RPCs).
37638765	2024	Nucleic acids research	scPlantDB: a comprehensive database for exploring cell types and markers of plant cell atlases.	Recent advancements in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology have enabled the comprehensive profiling of gene expression patterns at the single-cell level, offering unprecedented insights into cellular diversity and heterogeneity within plant tissues. In this study, we present a systematic approach to construct a plant single-cell database, scPlantDB, which is publicly available at https://biobigdata.nju.edu.cn/scplantdb. We integrated single-cell transcriptomic profiles from 67 high-quality datasets across 17 plant species, comprising approximately 2.5 million cells. The data underwent rigorous collection, manual curation, strict quality control and standardized processing from public databases. scPlantDB offers interactive visualization of gene expression at the single-cell level, facilitating the exploration of both single-dataset and multiple-dataset analyses. It enables systematic comparison and functional annotation of markers across diverse cell types and species while providing tools to identify and compare cell types based on these markers. In summary, scPlantDB serves as a comprehensive database for investigating cell types and markers within plant cell atlases. It is a valuable resource for the plant research community.
36005887	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	propeller: testing for differences in cell type proportions in single cell data.	MOTIVATION: Single cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-seq) has rapidly gained popularity over the last few years for profiling the transcriptomes of thousands to millions of single cells. This technology is now being used to analyse experiments with complex designs including biological replication. One question that can be asked from single cell experiments, which has been difficult to directly address with bulk RNA-seq data, is whether the cell type proportions are different between two or more experimental conditions. As well as gene expression changes, the relative depletion or enrichment of a particular cell type can be the functional consequence of disease or treatment. However, cell type proportion estimates from scRNA-seq data are variable and statistical methods that can correctly account for different sources of variability are needed to confidently identify statistically significant shifts in cell type composition between experimental conditions. RESULTS: We have developed propeller, a robust and flexible method that leverages biological replication to find statistically significant differences in cell type proportions between groups. Using simulated cell type proportions data, we show that propeller performs well under a variety of scenarios. We applied propeller to test for significant changes in cell type proportions related to human heart development, ageing and COVID-19 disease severity. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The propeller method is publicly available in the open source speckle R package (https://github.com/phipsonlab/speckle). All the analysis code for the article is available at the associated analysis website: https://phipsonlab.github.io/propeller-paper-analysis/. The speckle package, analysis scripts and datasets have been deposited at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7009042. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
33959753	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	Anti-bias training for (sc)RNA-seq: experimental and computational approaches to improve precision.	RNA-seq, including single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), is plagued by insufficient sensitivity and lack of precision. As a result, the full potential of (sc)RNA-seq is limited. Major factors in this respect are the presence of global bias in most datasets, which affects detection and quantitation of RNA in a length-dependent fashion. In particular, scRNA-seq is affected by technical noise and a high rate of dropouts, where the vast majority of original transcripts is not converted into sequencing reads. We discuss these biases origins and implications, bioinformatics approaches to correct for them, and how biases can be exploited to infer characteristics of the sample preparation process, which in turn can be used to improve library preparation.
33926517	2021	Genome biology	PseudotimeDE: inference of differential gene expression along cell pseudotime with well-calibrated p-values from single-cell RNA sequencing data.	To investigate molecular mechanisms underlying cell state changes, a crucial analysis is to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes along the pseudotime inferred from single-cell RNA-sequencing data. However, existing methods do not account for pseudotime inference uncertainty, and they have either ill-posed p-values or restrictive models. Here we propose PseudotimeDE, a DE gene identification method that adapts to various pseudotime inference methods, accounts for pseudotime inference uncertainty, and outputs well-calibrated p-values. Comprehensive simulations and real-data applications verify that PseudotimeDE outperforms existing methods in false discovery rate control and power.
39312689	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	A self-training interpretable cell type annotation framework using specific marker gene.	MOTIVATION: Recent advances in sequencing technology provide opportunities to study biological processes at a higher resolution. Cell type annotation is an important step in scRNA-seq analysis, which often relies on established marker genes. However, most of the previous methods divide the identification of cell types into two stages, clustering and assignment, whose performances are susceptible to the clustering algorithm, and the marker information cannot effectively guide the clustering process. Furthermore, their linear heuristic-based cell assignment process is often insufficient to capture potential dependencies between cells and types. RESULTS: Here, we present Interpretable Cell Type Annotation based on self-training (sICTA), a marker-based cell type annotation method that combines the self-training strategy with pseudo-labeling and the nonlinear association capturing capability of Transformer. In addition, we incorporate biological priori knowledge of genes and pathways into the classifier through an attention mechanism to enhance the transparency of the model. A benchmark analysis on 11 publicly available single-cell datasets demonstrates the superiority of sICTA compared to state-of-the-art methods. The robustness of our method is further validated by evaluating the prediction accuracy of the model on different cell types for each single-cell data. Moreover, ablation studies show that self-training and the ability to capture potential dependencies between cells and cell types, both of which are mutually reinforcing, work together to improve model performance. Finally, we apply sICTA to the pancreatic dataset, exemplifying the interpretable attention matrix captured by sICTA. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code of sICTA is available in public at https://github.com/nbnbhwyy/sICTA. The processed datasets can be found at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jbqSxacL_IDIZ4uPjq220C9Kv024m9eL. The final version of the model will be permanently available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13474010.
39581873	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	VGAE-CCI: variational graph autoencoder-based construction of 3D spatial cell-cell communication network.	Cell-cell communication plays a critical role in maintaining normal biological functions, regulating development and differentiation, and controlling immune responses. The rapid development of single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics sequencing (ST-seq) technologies provides essential data support for in-depth and comprehensive analysis of cell-cell communication. However, ST-seq data often contain incomplete data and systematic biases, which may reduce the accuracy and reliability of predicting cell-cell communication. Furthermore, other methods for analyzing cell-cell communication mainly focus on individual tissue sections, neglecting cell-cell communication across multiple tissue layers, and fail to comprehensively elucidate cell-cell communication networks within three-dimensional tissues. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose VGAE-CCI, a deep learning framework based on the Variational Graph Autoencoder, capable of identifying cell-cell communication across multiple tissue layers. Additionally, this model can be applied to spatial transcriptomics data with missing or partially incomplete data and can clustered cells at single-cell resolution based on spatial encoding information within complex tissues, thereby enabling more accurate inference of cell-cell communication. Finally, we tested our method on six datasets and compared it with other state of art methods for predicting cell-cell communication. Our method outperformed other methods across multiple metrics, demonstrating its efficiency and reliability in predicting cell-cell communication.
39402623	2024	Genome biology	scCTS: identifying the cell type-specific marker genes from population-level single-cell RNA-seq.	Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides gene expression profiles of individual cells from complex samples, facilitating the detection of cell type-specific marker genes. In scRNA-seq experiments with multiple donors, the population level variation brings an extra layer of complexity in cell type-specific gene detection, for example, they may not appear in all donors. Motivated by this observation, we develop a statistical model named scCTS to identify cell type-specific genes from population-level scRNA-seq data. Extensive data analyses demonstrate that the proposed method identifies more biologically meaningful cell type-specific genes compared to traditional methods.
33119753	2021	Nucleic acids research	Aging Atlas: a multi-omics database for aging biology.	Organismal aging is driven by interconnected molecular changes encompassing internal and extracellular factors. Combinational analysis of high-throughput 'multi-omics' datasets (gathering information from genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and pharmacogenomics), at either populational or single-cell levels, can provide a multi-dimensional, integrated profile of the heterogeneous aging process with unprecedented throughput and detail. These new strategies allow for the exploration of the molecular profile and regulatory status of gene expression during aging, and in turn, facilitate the development of new aging interventions. With a continually growing volume of valuable aging-related data, it is necessary to establish an open and integrated database to support a wide spectrum of aging research. The Aging Atlas database aims to provide a wide range of life science researchers with valuable resources that allow access to a large-scale of gene expression and regulation datasets created by various high-throughput omics technologies. The current implementation includes five modules: transcriptomics (RNA-seq), single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq), epigenomics (ChIP-seq), proteomics (protein-protein interaction), and pharmacogenomics (geroprotective compounds). Aging Atlas provides user-friendly functionalities to explore age-related changes in gene expression, as well as raw data download services. Aging Atlas is freely available at https://bigd.big.ac.cn/aging/index.
36440766	2022	Nucleic acids research	scAB detects multiresolution cell states with clinical significance by integrating single-cell genomics and bulk sequencing data.	Although single-cell sequencing has provided a powerful tool to deconvolute cellular heterogeneity of diseases like cancer, extrapolating clinical significance or identifying clinically-relevant cells remains challenging. Here, we propose a novel computational method scAB, which integrates single-cell genomics data with clinically annotated bulk sequencing data via a knowledge- and graph-guided matrix factorization model. Once combined, scAB provides a coarse- and fine-grain multiresolution perspective of phenotype-associated cell states and prognostic signatures previously not visible by single-cell genomics. We use scAB to enhance live cancer single-cell RNA-seq data, identifying clinically-relevant previously unrecognized cancer and stromal cell subsets whose signatures show a stronger poor-survival association. The identified fine-grain cell subsets are associated with distinct cancer hallmarks and prognosis power. Furthermore, scAB demonstrates its utility as a biomarker identification tool, with the ability to predict immunotherapy, drug responses and survival when applied to melanoma single-cell RNA-seq datasets and glioma single-cell ATAC-seq datasets. Across multiple single-cell and bulk datasets from different cancer types, we also demonstrate the superior performance of scAB in generating prognosis signatures and survival predictions over existing models. Overall, scAB provides an efficient tool for prioritizing clinically-relevant cell subsets and predictive signatures, utilizing large publicly available databases to improve prognosis and treatments.
35451457	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	GMHCC: high-throughput analysis of biomolecular data using graph-based multiple hierarchical consensus clustering.	MOTIVATION: Thanks to the development of high-throughput sequencing technologies, massive amounts of various biomolecular data have been accumulated to revolutionize the study of genomics and molecular biology. One of the main challenges in analyzing this biomolecular data is to cluster their subtypes into subpopulations to facilitate subsequent downstream analysis. Recently, many clustering methods have been developed to address the biomolecular data. However, the computational methods often suffer from many limitations such as high dimensionality, data heterogeneity and noise. RESULTS: In our study, we develop a novel Graph-based Multiple Hierarchical Consensus Clustering (GMHCC) method with an unsupervised graph-based feature ranking (FR) and a graph-based linking method to explore the multiple hierarchical information of the underlying partitions of the consensus clustering for multiple types of biomolecular data. Indeed, we first propose to use a graph-based unsupervised FR model to measure each feature by building a graph over pairwise features and then providing each feature with a rank. Subsequently, to maintain the diversity and robustness of basic partitions (BPs), we propose multiple diverse feature subsets to generate several BPs and then explore the hierarchical structures of the multiple BPs by refining the global consensus function. Finally, we develop a new graph-based linking method, which explicitly considers the relationships between clusters to generate the final partition. Experiments on multiple types of biomolecular data including 35 cancer gene expression datasets and eight single-cell RNA-seq datasets validate the effectiveness of our method over several state-of-the-art consensus clustering approaches. Furthermore, differential gene analysis, gene ontology enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway analysis are conducted, providing novel insights into cell developmental lineages and characterization mechanisms. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code is available at GitHub: https://github.com/yifuLu/GMHCC. The software and the supporting data can be downloaded from: https://figshare.com/articles/software/GMHCC/17111291.

38572750	2024	Nucleic acids research	SingmiR: a single-cell miRNA alignment and analysis tool.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has revolutionized our understanding of cell biology, developmental and pathophysiological molecular processes, paving the way toward novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. However, most of the gene regulatory processes on the single-cell level are still unknown, including post-transcriptional control conferred by microRNAs (miRNAs). Like the established single-cell gene expression analysis, advanced computational expertise is required to comprehensively process newly emerging single-cell miRNA-seq datasets. A web server providing a workflow tailored for single-cell miRNA-seq data with a self-explanatory interface is currently not available. Here, we present SingmiR, enabling the rapid (pre-)processing and quantification of human miRNAs from noncoding single-cell samples. It performs read trimming for different library preparation protocols, generates automated quality control reports and provides feature-normalized count files. Numerous standard and advanced analyses such as dimension reduction, clustered feature heatmaps, sample correlation heatmaps and differential expression statistics are implemented. We aim to speed up the prototyping pipeline for biologists developing single-cell miRNA-seq protocols on small to medium-sized datasets. SingmiR is freely available to all users without the need for a login at https://www.ccb.uni-saarland.de/singmir.
34160582	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	Consensus clustering of single-cell RNA-seq data by enhancing network affinity.	Elucidation of cell subpopulations at high resolution is a key and challenging goal of single-cell ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis. Although unsupervised clustering methods have been proposed for de novo identification of cell populations, their performance and robustness suffer from the high variability, low capture efficiency and high dropout rates which are characteristic of scRNA-seq experiments. Here, we present a novel unsupervised method for Single-cell Clustering by Enhancing Network Affinity (SCENA), which mainly employed three strategies: selecting multiple gene sets, enhancing local affinity among cells and clustering of consensus matrices. Large-scale validations on 13 real scRNA-seq datasets show that SCENA has high accuracy in detecting cell populations and is robust against dropout noise. When we applied SCENA to large-scale scRNA-seq data of mouse brain cells, known cell types were successfully detected, and novel cell types of interneurons were identified with differential expression of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunits and transporters. SCENA is equipped with CPU + GPU (Central Processing Units + Graphics Processing Units) heterogeneous parallel computing to achieve high running speed. The high performance and running speed of SCENA combine into a new and efficient platform for biological discoveries in clustering analysis of large and diverse scRNA-seq datasets.
38956606	2024	Genome biology	Heterogeneous pseudobulk simulation enables realistic benchmarking of cell-type deconvolution methods.	BACKGROUND: Computational cell type deconvolution enables the estimation of cell type abundance from bulk tissues and is important for understanding tissue microenviroment, especially in tumor tissues. With rapid development of deconvolution methods, many benchmarking studies have been published aiming for a comprehensive evaluation for these methods. Benchmarking studies rely on cell-type resolved single-cell RNA-seq data to create simulated pseudobulk datasets by adding individual cells-types in controlled proportions. RESULTS: In our work, we show that the standard application of this approach, which uses randomly selected single cells, regardless of the intrinsic difference between them, generates synthetic bulk expression values that lack appropriate biological variance. We demonstrate why and how the current bulk simulation pipeline with random cells is unrealistic and propose a heterogeneous simulation strategy as a solution. The heterogeneously simulated bulk samples match up with the variance observed in real bulk datasets and therefore provide concrete benefits for benchmarking in several ways. We demonstrate that conceptual classes of deconvolution methods differ dramatically in their robustness to heterogeneity with reference-free methods performing particularly poorly. For regression-based methods, the heterogeneous simulation provides an explicit framework to disentangle the contributions of reference construction and regression methods to performance. Finally, we perform an extensive benchmark of diverse methods across eight different datasets and find BayesPrism and a hybrid MuSiC/CIBERSORTx approach to be the top performers. CONCLUSIONS: Our heterogeneous bulk simulation method and the entire benchmarking framework is implemented in a user friendly package https://github.com/humengying0907/deconvBenchmarking and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8206516 , enabling further developments in deconvolution methods.
31363221	2019	Nature methods	Gene expression atlas of a developing tissue by single cell expression correlation analysis.	The Drosophila wing disc has been a fundamental model system for the discovery of key signaling pathways and for our understanding of developmental processes. However, a complete map of gene expression in this tissue is lacking. To obtain a gene expression atlas in the wing disc, we employed single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and developed a method for analyzing scRNA-seq data based on gene expression correlations rather than cell mapping. This enables us to compute expression maps for all detected genes in the wing disc and to discover 824 genes with spatially restricted expression patterns. This approach identifies clusters of genes with similar expression patterns and functional relevance. As proof of concept, we characterize the previously unstudied gene CG5151 and show that it regulates Wnt signaling. Our method will enable the leveraging of scRNA-seq data for generating expression atlases of undifferentiated tissues during development.
34857654	2022	Genome research	Cell type-specific analysis by single-cell profiling identifies a stable mammalian tRNA-mRNA interface and increased translation efficiency in neurons.	The correlation between codon and anticodon pools influences the efficiency of translation, but whether differences exist in these pools across individual cells is unknown. We determined that codon usage and amino acid demand are highly stable across different cell types using available mouse and human single-cell RNA-sequencing atlases. After showing the robustness of ATAC-sequencing measurements for the analysis of tRNA gene usage, we quantified anticodon usage and amino acid supply in both mouse and human single-cell ATAC-seq atlases. We found that tRNA gene usage is overall coordinated across cell types, except in neurons, which clustered separately from other cell types. Integration of these data sets revealed a strong and statistically significant correlation between amino acid supply and demand across almost all cell types. Neurons have an enhanced translation efficiency over other cell types, driven by an increased supply of tRNA(Ala) (AGC) anticodons. This results in faster decoding of the Ala-GCC codon, as determined by cell type-specific ribosome profiling, suggesting that the reduction of tRNA(Ala) (AGC) anticodon pools may be implicated in neurological pathologies. This study, the first such examination of codon usage, anticodon usage, and translation efficiency resolved at the cell-type level with single-cell information, identifies a conserved landscape of translation elongation across mammalian cellular diversity and evolution.
35561207	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Non-negative Independent Factor Analysis disentangles discrete and continuous sources of variation in scRNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA-seq analysis has emerged as a powerful tool for understanding inter-cellular heterogeneity. Due to the inherent noise of the data, computational techniques often rely on dimensionality reduction (DR) as both a pre-processing step and an analysis tool. Ideally, DR should preserve the biological information while discarding the noise. However, if the DR is to be used directly to gain biological insight it must also be interpretable-that is the individual dimensions of the reduction should correspond to specific biological variables such as cell-type identity or pathway activity. Maximizing biological interpretability necessitates making assumption about the data structures and the choice of the model is critical. RESULTS: We present a new probabilistic single-cell factor analysis model, Non-negative Independent Factor Analysis (NIFA), that incorporates different interpretability inducing assumptions into a single modeling framework. The key advantage of our NIFA model is that it simultaneously models uni- and multi-modal latent factors, and thus isolates discrete cell-type identity and continuous pathway activity into separate components. We apply our approach to a range of datasets where cell-type identity is known, and we show that NIFA-derived factors outperform results from ICA, PCA, NMF and scCoGAPS (an NMF method designed for single-cell data) in terms of disentangling biological sources of variation. Studying an immunotherapy dataset in detail, we show that NIFA is able to reproduce and refine previous findings in a single analysis framework and enables the discovery of new clinically relevant cell states. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: NFIA is a R package which is freely available at GitHub (https://github.com/wgmao/NIFA). The test dataset is archived at https://zenodo.org/record/6286646. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
34962260	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	SIGNET: single-cell RNA-seq-based gene regulatory network prediction using multiple-layer perceptron bagging.	High-throughput single-cell RNA-seq data have provided unprecedented opportunities for deciphering the regulatory interactions among genes. However, such interactions are complex and often nonlinear or nonmonotonic, which makes their inference using linear models challenging. We present SIGNET, a deep learning-based framework for capturing complex regulatory relationships between genes under the assumption that the expression levels of transcription factors participating in gene regulation are strong predictors of the expression of their target genes. Evaluations based on a variety of real and simulated scRNA-seq datasets showed that SIGNET is more sensitive to ChIP-seq validated regulatory interactions in different types of cells, particularly rare cells. Therefore, this process is more effective for various downstream analyses, such as cell clustering and gene regulatory network inference. We demonstrated that SIGNET is a useful tool for identifying important regulatory modules driving various biological processes.
40668554	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Paradigms, innovations, and biological applications of RNA velocity: a comprehensive review.	Single-cell RNA sequencing enables unprecedented insights into cellular heterogeneity and lineage dynamics. RNA velocity, by modeling the temporal relationship between spliced and unspliced transcripts, extends this capability to predict future transcriptional states and uncover the directionality of cellular transitions. Since the introduction of foundational frameworks such as Velocyto and scVelo, an expanding array of computational tools has emerged, each based on distinct biophysical assumptions and modeling paradigms. To provide a structured overview of this rapidly evolving field, we categorize RNA velocity models into three classes: steady-state methods, trajectory methods, and state extrapolation methods, according to their underlying approaches to transcriptional kinetics inference. For each category, we systematically analyze both the overarching principles and the individual methods, comparing their assumptions, kinetic models, and computational strategies and assessing their respective strengths and limitations. To demonstrate the biological utility of these tools, we summarize representative applications of RNA velocity across developmental biology and diseased microenvironments. We further introduce emerging extensions of RNA velocity methods that go beyond classical splicing kinetics. Finally, we discuss existing limitations regarding model assumptions, preprocessing procedures, and velocity visualization and offer practical recommendations for model selection and application. This review offers a comprehensive guide to the RNA velocity landscape, supporting its effective implementation in dynamic transcriptomic research.
40729372	2025	PLoS computational biology	DNFE: Directed network flow entropy for detecting tipping points during biological processes.	"Typically, in dynamic biological processes, there is a critical state or tipping point that marks the transition from one stable state to another, surpassing which a considerable qualitative shift takes place. Identifying this tipping point and its driving network is essential to avert or delay disastrous outcomes. However, most traditional approaches built upon undirected networks still suffer from a lack of robustness and effectiveness when implemented based on high-dimensional small-sample data, especially for single-cell data. To address this challenge, we develop a directed network flow entropy (DNFE) method, which can transform measured omics data into a directed network. This method is applicable to both single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and bulk data. Applying this algorithm to six real datasets, including three single-cell datasets, two bulk tumor datasets, and a blood dataset, the method is proved to be effective not only in identifying critical states, as well as their dynamic network biomarkers, but also in helping explore regulatory relationships between genes. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the DNFE algorithm is robust across various noise levels and outperforms existing methods in detecting tipping points. Furthermore, the numerical simulations for 100-node and 1000-node gene regulatory networks illustrate the method's application for large-scale data. The DNFE method predicts active transcription factors, and further identified ""dark genes"", which are usually overlooked with traditional methods."
37550580	2023	Nature methods	Unsupervised removal of systematic background noise from droplet-based single-cell experiments using CellBender.	Droplet-based single-cell assays, including single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq), generate considerable background noise counts, the hallmark of which is nonzero counts in cell-free droplets and off-target gene expression in unexpected cell types. Such systematic background noise can lead to batch effects and spurious differential gene expression results. Here we develop a deep generative model based on the phenomenology of noise generation in droplet-based assays. The proposed model accurately distinguishes cell-containing droplets from cell-free droplets, learns the background noise profile and provides noise-free quantification in an end-to-end fashion. We implement this approach in the scalable and robust open-source software package CellBender. Analysis of simulated data demonstrates that CellBender operates near the theoretically optimal denoising limit. Extensive evaluations using real datasets and experimental benchmarks highlight enhanced concordance between droplet-based single-cell data and established gene expression patterns, while the learned background noise profile provides evidence of degraded or uncaptured cell types.
32542321	2020	Nucleic acids research	Combining single-cell RNA-sequencing with a molecular atlas unveils new markers for Caenorhabditis elegans neuron classes.	Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of the Caenorhabditis elegans nervous system offers the unique opportunity to obtain a partial expression profile for each neuron within a known connectome. Building on recent scRNA-seq data and on a molecular atlas describing the expression pattern of  approximately 800 genes at the single cell resolution, we designed an iterative clustering analysis aiming to match each cell-cluster to the  approximately 100 anatomically defined neuron classes of C. elegans. This heuristic approach successfully assigned 97 of the 118 neuron classes to a cluster. Sixty two clusters were assigned to a single neuron class and 15 clusters grouped neuron classes sharing close molecular signatures. Pseudotime analysis revealed a maturation process occurring in some neurons (e.g. PDA) during the L2 stage. Based on the molecular profiles of all identified neurons, we predicted cell fate regulators and experimentally validated unc-86 for the normal differentiation of RMG neurons. Furthermore, we observed that different classes of genes functionally diversify sensory neurons, interneurons and motorneurons. Finally, we designed 15 new neuron class-specific promoters validated in vivo. Amongst them, 10 represent the only specific promoter reported to this day, expanding the list of neurons amenable to genetic manipulations.
38011649	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Hierarchical and automated cell-type annotation and inference of cancer cell of origin with Census.	MOTIVATION: Cell-type annotation is a time-consuming yet critical first step in the analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data, especially when multiple similar cell subtypes with overlapping marker genes are present. Existing automated annotation methods have a number of limitations, including requiring large reference datasets, high computation time, shallow annotation resolution, and difficulty in identifying cancer cells or their most likely cell of origin. RESULTS: We developed Census, a biologically intuitive and fully automated cell-type identification method for single-cell RNA-seq data that can deeply annotate normal cells in mammalian tissues and identify malignant cells and their likely cell of origin. Motivated by the inherently stratified developmental programs of cellular differentiation, Census infers hierarchical cell-type relationships and uses gradient-boosted \decision trees that capitalize on nodal cell-type relationships to achieve high prediction speed and accuracy. When benchmarked on 44 atlas-scale normal and cancer, human and mouse tissues, Census significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics and naturally predicts the cell-of-origin of different cancers. Census is pretrained on the Tabula Sapiens to classify 175 cell-types from 24 organs; however, users can seamlessly train their own models for customized applications. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Census is available at Zenodo https://zenodo.org/records/7017103 and on our Github https://github.com/sjdlabgroup/Census.
37079737	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	LogBTF: gene regulatory network inference using Boolean threshold network model from single-cell gene expression data.	MOTIVATION: From a systematic perspective, it is crucial to infer and analyze gene regulatory network (GRN) from high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing data. However, most existing GRN inference methods mainly focus on the network topology, only few of them consider how to explicitly describe the updated logic rules of regulation in GRNs to obtain their dynamics. Moreover, some inference methods also fail to deal with the over-fitting problem caused by the noise in time series data. RESULTS: In this article, we propose a novel embedded Boolean threshold network method called LogBTF, which effectively infers GRN by integrating regularized logistic regression and Boolean threshold function. First, the continuous gene expression values are converted into Boolean values and the elastic net regression model is adopted to fit the binarized time series data. Then, the estimated regression coefficients are applied to represent the unknown Boolean threshold function of the candidate Boolean threshold network as the dynamical equations. To overcome the multi-collinearity and over-fitting problems, a new and effective approach is designed to optimize the network topology by adding a perturbation design matrix to the input data and thereafter setting sufficiently small elements of the output coefficient vector to zeros. In addition, the cross-validation procedure is implemented into the Boolean threshold network model framework to strengthen the inference capability. Finally, extensive experiments on one simulated Boolean value dataset, dozens of simulation datasets, and three real single-cell RNA sequencing datasets demonstrate that the LogBTF method can infer GRNs from time series data more accurately than some other alternative methods for GRN inference. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source data and code are available at https://github.com/zpliulab/LogBTF.
33681983	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	Knowledge-based classification of fine-grained immune cell types in single-cell RNA-Seq data.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) is an emerging strategy for characterizing immune cell populations. Compared to flow or mass cytometry, scRNA-Seq could potentially identify cell types and activation states that lack precise cell surface markers. However, scRNA-Seq is currently limited due to the need to manually classify each immune cell from its transcriptional profile. While recently developed algorithms accurately annotate coarse cell types (e.g. T cells versus macrophages), making fine distinctions (e.g. CD8+ effector memory T cells) remains a difficult challenge. To address this, we developed a machine learning classifier called ImmClassifier that leverages a hierarchical ontology of cell type. We demonstrate that its predictions are highly concordant with flow-based markers from CITE-seq and outperforms other tools (+15% recall, +14% precision) in distinguishing fine-grained cell types with comparable performance on coarse ones. Thus, ImmClassifier can be used to explore more deeply the heterogeneity of the immune system in scRNA-Seq experiments.
39172488	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	LineageVAE: reconstructing historical cell states and transcriptomes toward unobserved progenitors.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables comprehensive characterization of the cell state. However, its destructive nature prohibits measuring gene expression changes during dynamic processes such as embryogenesis or cell state divergence due to injury or disease. Although recent studies integrating scRNA-seq with lineage tracing have provided clonal insights between progenitor and mature cells, challenges remain. Because of their experimental nature, observations are sparse, and cells observed in the early state are not the exact progenitors of cells observed at later time points. To overcome these limitations, we developed LineageVAE, a novel computational methodology that utilizes deep learning based on the property that cells sharing barcodes have identical progenitors. RESULTS: LineageVAE is a deep generative model that transforms scRNA-seq observations with identical lineage barcodes into sequential trajectories toward a common progenitor in a latent cell state space. This method enables the reconstruction of unobservable cell state transitions, historical transcriptomes, and regulatory dynamics at a single-cell resolution. Applied to hematopoiesis and reprogrammed fibroblast datasets, LineageVAE demonstrated its ability to restore backward cell state transitions and infer progenitor heterogeneity and transcription factor activity along differentiation trajectories. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The LineageVAE model was implemented in Python using the PyTorch deep learning library. The code is available on GitHub at https://github.com/LzrRacer/LineageVAE/.
35753695	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	Cell-cell communication inference and analysis in the tumour microenvironments from single-cell transcriptomics: data resources and computational strategies.	Carcinomas are complex ecosystems composed of cancer, stromal and immune cells. Communication between these cells and their microenvironments induces cancer progression and causes therapy resistance. In order to improve the treatment of cancers, it is essential to quantify crosstalk between and within various cell types in a tumour microenvironment. Focusing on the coordinated expression patterns of ligands and cognate receptors, cell-cell communication can be inferred through ligand-receptor interactions (LRIs). In this manuscript, we carry out the following work: (i) introduce pipeline for ligand-receptor-mediated intercellular communication estimation from single-cell transcriptomics and list a few available LRI-related databases and visualization tools; (ii) demonstrate seven classical intercellular communication scoring strategies, highlight four types of representative intercellular communication inference methods, including network-based approaches, machine learning-based approaches, spatial information-based approaches and other approaches; (iii) summarize the evaluation and validation avenues for intercellular communication inference and analyze the advantages and limitations for the above four types of cell-cell communication methods; (iv) comment several major challenges while provide further research directions for intercellular communication analysis in the tumour microenvironments. We anticipate that this work helps to better understand intercellular crosstalk and to further develop powerful cell-cell communication estimation tools for tumor-targeted therapy.
34184038	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	EcTracker: Tracking and elucidating ectopic expression leveraging large-scale scRNA-seq studies.	Dramatic genomic alterations, either inducible or in a pathological state, dismantle the core regulatory networks, leading to the activation of normally silent genes. Despite possessing immense therapeutic potential, accurate detection of these transcripts is an ever-challenging task, as it requires prior knowledge of the physiological gene expression levels. Here, we introduce EcTracker, an R-/Shiny-based single-cell data analysis web server that bestows a plethora of functionalities that collectively enable the quantitative and qualitative assessments of bona fide cell types or tissue-specific transcripts and, conversely, the ectopically expressed genes in the single-cell ribonucleic acid sequencing datasets. Moreover, it also allows regulon analysis to identify the key transcriptional factors regulating the user-selected gene signatures. To demonstrate the EcTracker functionality, we reanalyzed the CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) dataset of the human embryonic stem cells differentiated into endoderm lineage and identified the prominent enrichment of a specific gene signature in the SMAD2 knockout cells whose identity was ambiguous in the original study. The key distinguishing features of EcTracker lie within its processing speed, availability of multiple add-on modules, interactive graphical user interface and comprehensiveness. In summary, EcTracker provides an easy-to-perform, integrative and end-to-end single-cell data analysis platform that allows decoding of cellular identities, identification of ectopically expressed genes and their regulatory networks, and therefore, collectively imparts a novel dimension for analyzing single-cell datasets.
36631398	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	A novel Bayesian framework for harmonizing information across tissues and studies to increase cell type deconvolution accuracy.	Computational cell type deconvolution on bulk transcriptomics data can reveal cell type proportion heterogeneity across samples. One critical factor for accurate deconvolution is the reference signature matrix for different cell types. Compared with inferring reference signature matrices from cell lines, rapidly accumulating single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data provide a richer and less biased resource. However, deriving cell type signature from scRNA-seq data is challenging due to high biological and technical noises. In this article, we introduce a novel Bayesian framework, tranSig, to improve signature matrix inference from scRNA-seq by leveraging shared cell type-specific expression patterns across different tissues and studies. Our simulations show that tranSig is robust to the number of signature genes and tissues specified in the model. Applications of tranSig to bulk RNA sequencing data from peripheral blood, bronchoalveolar lavage and aorta demonstrate its accuracy and power to characterize biological heterogeneity across groups. In summary, tranSig offers an accurate and robust approach to defining gene expression signatures of different cell types, facilitating improved in silico cell type deconvolutions.
40234247	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	adverSCarial: assessing the vulnerability of single-cell RNA-sequencing classifiers to adversarial attacks.	MOTIVATION: Several machine learning (ML) algorithms dedicated to the detection of healthy and diseased cell types from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data have been proposed for biomedical purposes. This raises concerns about their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, exploiting threats causing malicious alterations of the classifiers' output with defective and well-crafted input. RESULTS: With adverSCarial, adversarial attacks of single-cell transcriptomic data can easily be simulated in a range of ways, from expanded but undetectable modifications to aggressive and targeted ones, enabling vulnerability assessment of scRNA-seq classifiers to variations of gene expression, whether technical, biological, or intentional. We exemplify the usefulness and performance with a panel of attack modes proposed in adverSCarial by assessing the robustness of five scRNA-seq classifiers, each belonging to a distinct class of ML algorithm, and explore the potential unlocked by exposing their inner workings and sensitivities on four different datasets. These analyses can guide the development of more reliable models, with improved interpretability, usable in biomedical research and future clinical applications. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: adverSCarial is a freely available R package accessible from Bioconductor: https://bioconductor.org/packages/adverSCarial/ or https://doi.org/10.18129/B9.bioc.adverSCarial. A development version is available at https://github.com/GhislainFievet/adverSCarial.
33462507	2021	Nature biotechnology	Delineating copy number and clonal substructure in human tumors from single-cell transcriptomes.	Single-cell transcriptomic analysis is widely used to study human tumors. However, it remains challenging to distinguish normal cell types in the tumor microenvironment from malignant cells and to resolve clonal substructure within the tumor. To address these challenges, we developed an integrative Bayesian segmentation approach called copy number karyotyping of aneuploid tumors (CopyKAT) to estimate genomic copy number profiles at an average genomic resolution of 5 Mb from read depth in high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. We applied CopyKAT to analyze 46,501 single cells from 21 tumors, including triple-negative breast cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, anaplastic thyroid cancer, invasive ductal carcinoma and glioblastoma, to accurately (98%) distinguish cancer cells from normal cell types. In three breast tumors, CopyKAT resolved clonal subpopulations that differed in the expression of cancer genes, such as KRAS, and signatures, including epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, DNA repair, apoptosis and hypoxia. These data show that CopyKAT can aid in the analysis of scRNA-seq data in a variety of solid human tumors.
33558698	2021	Nature biotechnology	Quantifying the effect of experimental perturbations at single-cell resolution.	Current methods for comparing single-cell RNA sequencing datasets collected in multiple conditions focus on discrete regions of the transcriptional state space, such as clusters of cells. Here we quantify the effects of perturbations at the single-cell level using a continuous measure of the effect of a perturbation across the transcriptomic space. We describe this space as a manifold and develop a relative likelihood estimate of observing each cell in each of the experimental conditions using graph signal processing. This likelihood estimate can be used to identify cell populations specifically affected by a perturbation. We also develop vertex frequency clustering to extract populations of affected cells at the level of granularity that matches the perturbation response. The accuracy of our algorithm at identifying clusters of cells that are enriched or depleted in each condition is, on average, 57% higher than the next-best-performing algorithm tested. Gene signatures derived from these clusters are more accurate than those of six alternative algorithms in ground truth comparisons.
40671174	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	scRECL: representative ensembles with contrastive learning for scRNA-seq data clustering analysis.	Single-cell transcriptomics characterizes gene expression profiles at the single-cell level, offering an unprecedented opportunity to understand cellular systems. As a fundamental task in single-cell data analysis, cell clustering significantly contributes to identifying cellular heterogeneity, thereby affecting downstream analyses. A number of deep learning methods have been proposed for clustering single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. However, the large parameter space makes these methods sensitive to parameter settings. To leverage the strong capabilities of deep learning in capturing complex structures in single-cell data while ensuring algorithmic robustness, we propose a contrastive ensemble learning method named scRECL for scRNA-seq data clustering. In our approach, Siamese neural networks are trained under various $k$-nearest neighbors partitions to obtain low-dimensional embeddings of the scRNA-seq data. Multiplex graphs in representative element selection help filter out noisy and redundant cells. Consequently, contrastive ensemble learning is performed for efficient and effective latent embedding, as well as robust analysis of cellular heterogeneity in scRNA-seq data.
40317049	2025	Genome biology	SlideCNA: spatial copy number alteration detection from Slide-seq-like spatial transcriptomics data.	Solid tumors are spatially heterogeneous in their genetic, molecular, and cellular composition, but recent spatial profiling studies have mostly charted genetic and RNA variation in tumors separately. To leverage the potential of RNA to identify copy number alterations (CNAs), we develop SlideCNA, a computational tool to extract CNA signals from sparse spatial transcriptomics data with near single cellular resolution. SlideCNA uses expression-aware spatial binning to overcome sparsity limitations while maintaining spatial signal to recover CNA patterns. We test SlideCNA on simulated and real Slide-seq data of (metastatic) breast cancer and demonstrate its potential for spatial subclone detection.
34059827	2021	Nature methods	Ultra-high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing and perturbation screening with combinatorial fluidic indexing.	Cell atlas projects and high-throughput perturbation screens require single-cell sequencing at a scale that is challenging with current technology. To enable cost-effective single-cell sequencing for millions of individual cells, we developed 'single-cell combinatorial fluidic indexing' (scifi). The scifi-RNA-seq assay combines one-step combinatorial preindexing of entire transcriptomes inside permeabilized cells with subsequent single-cell RNA-seq using microfluidics. Preindexing allows us to load several cells per droplet and computationally demultiplex their individual expression profiles. Thereby, scifi-RNA-seq massively increases the throughput of droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq, and provides a straightforward way of multiplexing thousands of samples in a single experiment. Compared with multiround combinatorial indexing, scifi-RNA-seq provides an easy and efficient workflow. Compared to cell hashing methods, which flag and discard droplets containing more than one cell, scifi-RNA-seq resolves and retains individual transcriptomes from overloaded droplets. We benchmarked scifi-RNA-seq on various human and mouse cell lines, validated it for primary human T cells and applied it in a highly multiplexed CRISPR screen with single-cell transcriptome readout of T cell receptor activation.
40704686	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Enhancing and accelerating cell type deconvolution of large-scale spatial transcriptomics slices with dual network model.	MOTIVATION: Cell type deconvolution deciphers spatial distribution of mRNA transcripts at single cell level by integrating single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics data to infer mixture of cell types of spots in slices. Current algorithms are criticized for neglecting connection between scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data, as well as time-consuming, hampering their application to large-scale datasets. RESULTS: In this study, we propose a joint learning nonnegative matrix factorization algorithm for fast cell type deconvolution (aka jMF2D), which integrates scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data with network models. To bridge scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data, jMF2D jointly learns cell type similarity network to enhance quality of signatures of cell types, thereby promoting accuracy and efficiency of deconvolution. Experiments demonstrate that jMF2D outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accuracy by saving about 90% running time on various datasets generated by different platforms. Furthermore, it can also facilitates the identification of spatial domains and bio-marker genes, providing an efficient and effective model for analyzing spatial transcriptomics data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The software is coded using python, and is free available for academic https://github.com/xkmaxidian/jMF2D.
35536286	2022	Nucleic acids research	ICARUS, an interactive web server for single cell RNA-seq analysis.	Here we present ICARUS, a web server to enable users without experience in R to undertake single cell RNA-seq analysis. The focal point of ICARUS is its intuitive tutorial-style user interface, designed to guide logical navigation through the multitude of pre-processing, analysis and visualization steps. ICARUS is easily accessible through a dedicated web server (https://launch.icarus-scrnaseq.cloud.edu.au/) and avoids installation of software on the user's computer. Notable features include the facility to apply quality control thresholds and adjust dimensionality reduction and cell clustering parameters. Data is visualized through 2D/3D UMAP and t-SNE plots and may be curated to remove potential confounders such as cell cycle heterogeneity. ICARUS offers flexible differential expression analysis with user-defined cell groups and gene set enrichment analysis to identify likely affected biological pathways. Eleven organisms including human, dog, mouse, rat, zebrafish, fruit fly, nematode, yeast, cattle, chicken and pig are currently supported. Visualization of multimodal data including those generated by CITE-seq and the 10X Genomics Multiome kit is included. ICARUS incorporates a function to save the current state of analysis avoiding computationally intensive steps during repeat analysis. The complete analysis of a typical single cell RNA-seq dataset by inexperienced users may be achieved in 1-2 h.
32251445	2020	PLoS computational biology	MAGIC: A tool for predicting transcription factors and cofactors driving gene sets using ENCODE data.	Transcriptomic profiling is an immensely powerful hypothesis generating tool. However, accurately predicting the transcription factors (TFs) and cofactors that drive transcriptomic differences between samples is challenging. A number of algorithms draw on ChIP-seq tracks to define TFs and cofactors behind gene changes. These approaches assign TFs and cofactors to genes via a binary designation of 'target', or 'non-target' followed by Fisher Exact Tests to assess enrichment of TFs and cofactors. ENCODE archives 2314 ChIP-seq tracks of 684 TFs and cofactors assayed across a 117 human cell lines under a multitude of growth and maintenance conditions. The algorithm presented herein, Mining Algorithm for GenetIc Controllers (MAGIC), uses ENCODE ChIP-seq data to look for statistical enrichment of TFs and cofactors in gene bodies and flanking regions in gene lists without an a priori binary classification of genes as targets or non-targets. When compared to other TF mining resources, MAGIC displayed favourable performance in predicting TFs and cofactors that drive gene changes in 4 settings: 1) A cell line expressing or lacking single TF, 2) Breast tumors divided along PAM50 designations 3) Whole brain samples from WT mice or mice lacking a single TF in a particular neuronal subtype 4) Single cell RNAseq analysis of neurons divided by Immediate Early Gene expression levels. In summary, MAGIC is a standalone application that produces meaningful predictions of TFs and cofactors in transcriptomic experiments.
32415966	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scVAE: variational auto-encoders for single-cell gene expression data.	MOTIVATION: Models for analysing and making relevant biological inferences from massive amounts of complex single-cell transcriptomic data typically require several individual data-processing steps, each with their own set of hyperparameter choices. With deep generative models one can work directly with count data, make likelihood-based model comparison, learn a latent representation of the cells and capture more of the variability in different cell populations. RESULTS: We propose a novel method based on variational auto-encoders (VAEs) for analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. It avoids data preprocessing by using raw count data as input and can robustly estimate the expected gene expression levels and a latent representation for each cell. We tested several count likelihood functions and a variant of the VAE that has a priori clustering in the latent space. We show for several scRNA-seq datasets that our method outperforms recently proposed scRNA-seq methods in clustering cells and that the resulting clusters reflect cell types. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Our method, called scVAE, is implemented in Python using the TensorFlow machine-learning library, and it is freely available at https://github.com/scvae/scvae. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
40802529	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	A semi-supervised Bayesian approach for marker gene trajectory inference from single-cell RNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: Trajectory inference methods are essential for extracting temporal ordering from static single-cell transcriptomic profiles, thus facilitating the accurate delineation of cellular developmental hierarchies and cell-fate transitions. However, numerous existing methods treat trajectory inference as an unsupervised learning task, rendering them susceptible to technical noise and data sparsity, which often lead to unstable reconstructions and ambiguous lineage assignments. RESULTS: Here, we introduce BayesTraj, a semi-supervised Bayesian framework that incorporates prior knowledge of lineage topology and marker-gene expression to robustly reconstruct differentiation trajectories from scRNA-seq data. BayesTraj models cellular differentiation as a probabilistic mixture of latent lineages and captures marker-gene dynamics through parametric functions. Posterior inference is conducted using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), yielding estimates of pseudotime, lineage proportions, and gene activation parameters. Evaluations on both simulated and real datasets with diverse branching structures demonstrate that BayesTraj consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in pseudotime inference. In addition, it provides per-cell branch-assignment probabilities, enabling the quantification of differentiation potential using Shannon entropy and the detection of lineage-specific gene expression via Bayesian model comparison. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: BayesTraj is written in R and available at https://github.com/SDU-W-Zhanglab/BayesTraj and has been archived on Zenodo (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.16758038).
37811897	2024	Nucleic acids research	SORC: an integrated spatial omics resource in cancer.	The interactions between tumor cells and the microenvironment play pivotal roles in the initiation, progression and metastasis of cancer. The advent of spatial transcriptomics data offers an opportunity to unravel the intricate dynamics of cellular states and cell-cell interactions in cancer. Herein, we have developed an integrated spatial omics resource in cancer (SORC, http://bio-bigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/SORC), which interactively visualizes and analyzes the spatial transcriptomics data in cancer. We manually curated currently available spatial transcriptomics datasets for 17 types of cancer, comprising 722 899 spots across 269 slices. Furthermore, we matched reference single-cell RNA sequencing data in the majority of spatial transcriptomics datasets, involving 334 379 cells and 46 distinct cell types. SORC offers five major analytical modules that address the primary requirements of spatial transcriptomics analysis, including slice annotation, identification of spatially variable genes, co-occurrence of immune cells and tumor cells, functional analysis and cell-cell communications. All these spatial transcriptomics data and in-depth analyses have been integrated into easy-to-browse and explore pages, visualized through intuitive tables and various image formats. In summary, SORC serves as a valuable resource for providing an unprecedented spatially resolved cellular map of cancer and identifying specific genes and functional pathways to enhance our understanding of the tumor microenvironment.
33471073	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Compression of quantification uncertainty for scRNA-seq counts.	MOTIVATION: Quantification estimates of gene expression from single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data have inherent uncertainty due to reads that map to multiple genes. Many existing scRNA-seq quantification pipelines ignore multi-mapping reads and therefore underestimate expected read counts for many genes. alevin accounts for multi-mapping reads and allows for the generation of 'inferential replicates', which reflect quantification uncertainty. Previous methods have shown improved performance when incorporating these replicates into statistical analyses, but storage and use of these replicates increases computation time and memory requirements. RESULTS: We demonstrate that storing only the mean and variance from a set of inferential replicates ('compression') is sufficient to capture gene-level quantification uncertainty, while reducing disk storage to as low as 9% of original storage, and memory usage when loading data to as low as 6%. Using these values, we generate 'pseudo-inferential' replicates from a negative binomial distribution and propose a general procedure for incorporating these replicates into a proposed statistical testing framework. When applying this procedure to trajectory-based differential expression analyses, we show false positives are reduced by more than a third for genes with high levels of quantification uncertainty. We additionally extend the Swish method to incorporate pseudo-inferential replicates and demonstrate improvements in computation time and memory usage without any loss in performance. Lastly, we show that discarding multi-mapping reads can result in significant underestimation of counts for functionally important genes in a real dataset. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: makeInfReps and splitSwish are implemented in the R/Bioconductor fishpond package available at https://bioconductor.org/packages/fishpond. Analyses and simulated datasets can be found in the paper's GitHub repo at https://github.com/skvanburen/scUncertaintyPaperCode. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
32554779	2020	Genome research	Coexpression enrichment analysis at the single-cell level reveals convergent defects in neural progenitor cells and their cell-type transitions in neurodevelopmental disorders.	A large number of genes have been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), but their contributions to NDD pathology are difficult to decipher without understanding their diverse roles in different brain cell types. Here, we integrated NDD genetics with single-cell RNA sequencing data to assess coexpression enrichment patterns of various NDD gene sets. We identified midfetal cortical neural progenitor cell development-more specifically, the ventricular radial glia-to-intermediate progenitor cell transition at gestational week 10-as a key point of convergence in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and epilepsy. Integrated Gene Ontology-based analysis further revealed that ASD genes activate neural differentiation and inhibit cell cycle during the transition, whereas epilepsy genes function as downstream effectors in the same processes, offering one possible explanation for the high comorbidity rate of the two disorders. This approach provides a framework for investigating the cell-type-specific pathophysiology of NDDs.
38426323	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Adjustment of scRNA-seq data to improve cell-type decomposition of spatial transcriptomics.	Most sequencing-based spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies do not achieve single-cell resolution where each captured location (spot) may contain a mixture of cells from heterogeneous cell types, and several cell-type decomposition methods have been proposed to estimate cell type proportions of each spot by integrating with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. However, these existing methods did not fully consider the effect of distribution difference between scRNA-seq and ST data for decomposition, leading to biased cell-type-specific genes derived from scRNA-seq for ST data. To address this issue, we develop an instance-based transfer learning framework to adjust scRNA-seq data by ST data to correctly match cell-type-specific gene expression. We evaluate the effect of raw and adjusted scRNA-seq data on cell-type decomposition by eight leading decomposition methods using both simulated and real datasets. Experimental results show that data adjustment can effectively reduce distribution difference and improve decomposition, thus enabling for a more precise depiction on spatial organization of cell types. We highlight the importance of data adjustment in integrative analysis of scRNA-seq with ST data and provide guidance for improved cell-type decomposition.
40966646	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	ISENICS: a model for identifying senescent immune cells and samples and characterization of their roles in tumor microenvironment.	Senescent immune cells secrete varied inflammatory factors that weaken the systemic anti-tumor ability and promote the proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells. Tumor cells could also accelerate the immune cellular senescence through diverse mechanisms. However, there has been a lack of indicators to quantify the senescence levels of different immune cell types. A model for Identifying Senescent Immune Cells and Samples was developed to explore the role of senescent immune cells in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). By integrating bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data, we constructed immune cell gene expression profiles for 23 cancer types using a deconvolution algorithm. By calculating the cellular senescence scores, we found that tumor samples exhibited higher senescence levels than normal samples. Monocytes/macrophages were prone to co-senescence with other cell subtypes. Differentially expressed genes in the high- and low-immune cellular senescence scores groups were enriched in the senescence pathway. Patients with higher levels of immunosenescence were associated with better prognosis. At the single-cell level, the number and strength of cell-to-cell interactions increased following immune cellular senescence in most cancers. Samples with senescent immune cells exhibited poorer immunotherapy response. Our study advances our understanding of senescent immune cells in the TIME, provides insights into cancer-specific relationships between immune cellular senescence and immune characteristics, and offers a model for identifying these senescent immune cells.
34252936	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	CALLR: a semi-supervised cell-type annotation method for single-cell RNA sequencing data.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has been widely applied to capture the heterogeneity of different cell types within complex tissues. An essential step in scRNA-seq data analysis is the annotation of cell types. Traditional cell-type annotation is mainly clustering the cells first, and then using the aggregated cluster-level expression profiles and the marker genes to label each cluster. Such methods are greatly dependent on the clustering results, which are insufficient for accurate annotation. RESULTS: In this article, we propose a semi-supervised learning method for cell-type annotation called CALLR. It combines unsupervised learning represented by the graph Laplacian matrix constructed from all the cells and supervised learning using sparse logistic regression. By alternately updating the cell clusters and annotation labels, high annotation accuracy can be achieved. The model is formulated as an optimization problem, and a computationally efficient algorithm is developed to solve it. Experiments on 10 real datasets show that CALLR outperforms the compared (semi-)supervised learning methods, and the popular clustering methods. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The implementation of CALLR is available at https://github.com/MathSZhang/CALLR. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
34851956	2021	PLoS computational biology	RNA editing regulates lncRNA splicing in human early embryo development.	RNA editing is a co- or post-transcriptional modification through which some cells can make discrete changes to specific nucleotide sequences within an RNA molecule after transcription. Previous studies found that RNA editing may be critically involved in cancer and aging. However, the function of RNA editing in human early embryo development is still unclear. In this study, through analyzing single cell RNA sequencing data, 36.7% RNA editing sites were found to have a have differential editing ratio among early embryo developmental stages, and there was a great reprogramming of RNA editing rates at the 8-cell stage, at which most of the differentially edited RNA editing sites (99.2%) had a decreased RNA editing rate. In addition, RNA editing was more likely to occur on RNA splicing sites during human early embryo development. Furthermore, long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) editing sites were found more likely to be on RNA splicing sites (odds ratio = 2.19, P = 1.37x10-8), while mRNA editing sites were less likely (odds ratio = 0.22, P = 8.38x10-46). Besides, we found that the RNA editing rate on lncRNA had a significantly higher correlation coefficient with the percentage spliced index (PSI) of lncRNA exons (R = 0.75, P = 4.90x10-16), which indicated that RNA editing may regulate lncRNA splicing during human early embryo development. Finally, functional analysis revealed that those RNA editing-regulated lncRNAs were enriched in signal transduction, the regulation of transcript expression, and the transmembrane transport of mitochondrial calcium ion. Overall, our study might provide a new insight into the mechanism of RNA editing on lncRNAs in human developmental biology and common birth defects.
34077420	2021	PLoS computational biology	coupleCoC+: An information-theoretic co-clustering-based transfer learning framework for the integrative analysis of single-cell genomic data.	Technological advances have enabled us to profile multiple molecular layers at unprecedented single-cell resolution and the available datasets from multiple samples or domains are growing. These datasets, including scRNA-seq data, scATAC-seq data and sc-methylation data, usually have different powers in identifying the unknown cell types through clustering. So, methods that integrate multiple datasets can potentially lead to a better clustering performance. Here we propose coupleCoC+ for the integrative analysis of single-cell genomic data. coupleCoC+ is a transfer learning method based on the information-theoretic co-clustering framework. In coupleCoC+, we utilize the information in one dataset, the source data, to facilitate the analysis of another dataset, the target data. coupleCoC+ uses the linked features in the two datasets for effective knowledge transfer, and it also uses the information of the features in the target data that are unlinked with the source data. In addition, coupleCoC+ matches similar cell types across the source data and the target data. By applying coupleCoC+ to the integrative clustering of mouse cortex scATAC-seq data and scRNA-seq data, mouse and human scRNA-seq data, mouse cortex sc-methylation and scRNA-seq data, and human blood dendritic cells scRNA-seq data from two batches, we demonstrate that coupleCoC+ improves the overall clustering performance and matches the cell subpopulations across multimodal single-cell genomic datasets. coupleCoC+ has fast convergence and it is computationally efficient. The software is available at https://github.com/cuhklinlab/coupleCoC_plus.
37529921	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Approximate estimation of cell-type resolution transcriptome in bulk tissue through matrix completion.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful tool for uncovering cellular heterogeneity. However, the high costs associated with this technique have rendered it impractical for studying large patient cohorts. We introduce ENIGMA (Deconvolution based on Regularized Matrix Completion), a method that addresses this limitation through accurately deconvoluting bulk tissue RNA-seq data into a readout with cell-type resolution by leveraging information from scRNA-seq data. By employing a matrix completion strategy, ENIGMA minimizes the distance between the mixture transcriptome obtained with bulk sequencing and a weighted combination of cell-type-specific expression. This allows the quantification of cell-type proportions and reconstruction of cell-type-specific transcriptomes. To validate its performance, ENIGMA was tested on both simulated and real datasets, including disease-related tissues, demonstrating its ability in uncovering novel biological insights.
39054391	2024	Nature methods	Biophysical modeling with variational autoencoders for bimodal, single-cell RNA sequencing data.	Here we present biVI, which combines the variational autoencoder framework of scVI with biophysical models describing the transcription and splicing kinetics of RNA molecules. We demonstrate on simulated and experimental single-cell RNA sequencing data that biVI retains the variational autoencoder's ability to capture cell type structure in a low-dimensional space while further enabling genome-wide exploration of the biophysical mechanisms, such as system burst sizes and degradation rates, that underlie observations.
32698836	2020	Genome biology	Single-cell RNA-seq analysis reveals ploidy-dependent and cell-specific transcriptome changes in Arabidopsis female gametophytes.	BACKGROUND: Polyploidy provides new genetic material that facilitates evolutionary novelty, species adaptation, and crop domestication. Polyploidy often leads to an increase in cell or organism size, which may affect transcript abundance or transcriptome size, but the relationship between polyploidy and transcriptome changes remains poorly understood. Plant cells often undergo endoreduplication, confounding the polyploid effect. RESULTS: To mitigate these effects, we select female gametic cells that are developmentally stable and void of endoreduplication. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in Arabidopsis thaliana tetraploid lines and isogenic diploids, we show that transcriptome abundance doubles in the egg cell and increases approximately 1.6-fold in the central cell, consistent with cell size changes. In the central cell of tetraploid plants, DEMETER (DME) is upregulated, which can activate PRC2 family members FIS2 and MEA, and may suppress the expression of other genes. Upregulation of cell size regulators in tetraploids, including TOR and OSR2, may increase the size of reproductive cells. In diploids, the order of transcriptome abundance is central cell, synergid cell, and egg cell, consistent with their cell size variation. Remarkably, we uncover new sets of female gametophytic cell-specific transcripts with predicted biological roles; the most abundant transcripts encode families of cysteine-rich peptides, implying roles in cell-cell recognition during double fertilization. CONCLUSIONS: Transcriptome in single cells doubles in tetraploid plants compared to diploid, while the degree of change and relationship to the cell size depends on cell types. These scRNA-seq resources are free of cross-contamination and are uniquely valuable for advancing plant hybridization, reproductive biology, and polyploid genomics.
26740580	2016	Nucleic acids research	Robust detection of alternative splicing in a population of single cells.	Single cell RNA-seq experiments provide valuable insight into cellular heterogeneity but suffer from low coverage, 3' bias and technical noise. These unique properties of single cell RNA-seq data make study of alternative splicing difficult, and thus most single cell studies have restricted analysis of transcriptome variation to the gene level. To address these limitations, we developed SingleSplice, which uses a statistical model to detect genes whose isoform usage shows biological variation significantly exceeding technical noise in a population of single cells. Importantly, SingleSplice is tailored to the unique demands of single cell analysis, detecting isoform usage differences without attempting to infer expression levels for full-length transcripts. Using data from spike-in transcripts, we found that our approach detects variation in isoform usage among single cells with high sensitivity and specificity. We also applied SingleSplice to data from mouse embryonic stem cells and discovered a set of genes that show significant biological variation in isoform usage across the set of cells. A subset of these isoform differences are linked to cell cycle stage, suggesting a novel connection between alternative splicing and the cell cycle.

32513233	2020	Genome biology	Direct-seq: programmed gRNA scaffold for streamlined scRNA-seq in CRISPR screen.	CRISPR-based genome perturbation provides a new avenue to conveniently change DNA sequences, transcription, and epigenetic modifications in genetic screens. However, it remains challenging to assay the complex molecular readouts after perturbation at high resolution and at scale. By introducing an A/G mixed capture sequence into the gRNA scaffold, we demonstrate that gRNA transcripts could be directly reverse transcribed by poly (dT) primer together with the endogenous mRNA, followed by high-content molecular phenotyping in scRNA-seq (Direct-seq). With this method, the CRISPR perturbation and its transcriptional readouts can be profiled together in a streamlined workflow.
31147676	2019	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	deconvSeq: deconvolution of cell mixture distribution in sequencing data.	MOTIVATION: Although single-cell sequencing is becoming more widely available, many tissue samples such as intracranial aneurysms are both fibrous and minute, and therefore not easily dissociated into single cells. To account for the cell type heterogeneity in such tissues therefore requires a computational method. We present a computational deconvolution method, deconvSeq, for sequencing data (RNA and bisulfite) obtained from bulk tissue. This method can also be applied to single-cell RNA sequencing data. RESULTS: DeconvSeq utilizes a generalized linear model to model effects of tissue type on feature quantification, which is specific to the data structure of the sequencing type used. Estimated model coefficients can then be used to predict the cell type mixture within a tissue. Predicted cell type mixtures were validated against actual cell counts in whole blood samples. Using this method, we obtained a mean correlation of 0.998 (95% CI 0.995-0.999) from the RNA sequencing data of 35 whole blood samples and 0.95 (95% CI 0.91-0.98) from the reduced representation bisulfite sequencing data from 35 whole blood samples. Using symmetric balances to obtain the correlation between compositional parts, we found that the lowest correlation occurred for monocytes for both RNA and bisulfite sequencing. Comparison with other methods of decomposition such as deconRNAseq, CIBERSORT, MuSiC and EpiDISH showed that deconvSeq is able to achieve good prediction using mean correlation with far fewer genes or CpG sites in the signature set. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Software implementing deconvSeq is available at https://github.com/rosedu1/deconvSeq. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
36550535	2022	Genome biology	Parallel single-cell and bulk transcriptome analyses reveal key features of the gastric tumor microenvironment.	BACKGROUND: The tumor microenvironment (TME) has been shown to strongly influence treatment outcome for cancer patients in various indications and to influence the overall survival. However, the cells forming the TME in gastric cancer have not been extensively characterized. RESULTS: We combine bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing from tumors and matched normal tissue of 24 treatment-naive GC patients to better understand which cell types and transcriptional programs are associated with malignant transformation of the stomach. Clustering 96,623 cells of non-epithelial origin reveals 81 well-defined TME cell types. We find that activated fibroblasts and endothelial cells are most prominently overrepresented in tumors. Intercellular network reconstruction and survival analysis of an independent cohort imply the importance of these cell types together with immunosuppressive myeloid cell subsets and regulatory T cells in establishing an immunosuppressive microenvironment that correlates with worsened prognosis and lack of response in anti-PD1-treated patients. In contrast, we find a subset of IFNgamma activated T cells and HLA-II expressing macrophages that are linked to treatment response and increased overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: Our gastric cancer single-cell TME compendium together with the matched bulk transcriptome data provides a unique resource for the identification of new potential biomarkers for patient stratification. This study helps further to elucidate the mechanism of gastric cancer and provides insights for therapy.
35929025	2023	Nucleic acids research	Construction of a cross-species cell landscape at single-cell level.	Individual cells are basic units of life. Despite extensive efforts to characterize the cellular heterogeneity of different organisms, cross-species comparisons of landscape dynamics have not been achieved. Here, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to map organism-level cell landscapes at multiple life stages for mice, zebrafish and Drosophila. By integrating the comprehensive dataset of > 2.6 million single cells, we constructed a cross-species cell landscape and identified signatures and common pathways that changed throughout the life span. We identified structural inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction as the most common hallmarks of organism aging, and found that pharmacological activation of mitochondrial metabolism alleviated aging phenotypes in mice. The cross-species cell landscape with other published datasets were stored in an integrated online portal-Cell Landscape. Our work provides a valuable resource for studying lineage development, maturation and aging.
35758618	2022	Nucleic acids research	RUV-III-NB: normalization of single cell RNA-seq data.	Normalization of single cell RNA-seq data remains a challenging task. The performance of different methods can vary greatly between datasets when unwanted factors and biology are associated. Most normalization methods also only remove the effects of unwanted variation for the cell embedding but not from gene-level data typically used for differential expression (DE) analysis to identify marker genes. We propose RUV-III-NB, a method that can be used to remove unwanted variation from both the cell embedding and gene-level counts. Using pseudo-replicates, RUV-III-NB explicitly takes into account potential association with biology when removing unwanted variation. The method can be used for both UMI or read counts and returns adjusted counts that can be used for downstream analyses such as clustering, DE and pseudotime analyses. Using published datasets with different technological platforms, kinds of biology and levels of association between biology and unwanted variation, we show that RUV-III-NB manages to remove library size and batch effects, strengthen biological signals, improve DE analyses, and lead to results exhibiting greater concordance with independent datasets of the same kind. The performance of RUV-III-NB is consistent and is not sensitive to the number of factors assumed to contribute to the unwanted variation.
33975339	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	WDNE: an integrative graphical model for inferring differential networks from multi-platform gene expression data with missing values.	The mechanisms controlling biological process, such as the development of disease or cell differentiation, can be investigated by examining changes in the networks of gene dependencies between states in the process. High-throughput experimental methods, like microarray and RNA sequencing, have been widely used to gather gene expression data, which paves the way to infer gene dependencies based on computational methods. However, most differential network analysis methods are designed to deal with fully observed data, but missing values, such as the dropout events in single-cell RNA-sequencing data, are frequent. New methods are needed to take account of these missing values. Moreover, since the changes of gene dependencies may be driven by certain perturbed genes, considering the changes in gene expression levels may promote the identification of gene network rewiring. In this study, a novel weighted differential network estimation (WDNE) model is proposed to handle multi-platform gene expression data with missing values and take account of changes in gene expression levels. Simulation studies demonstrate that WDNE outperforms state-of-the-art differential network estimation methods. When applied WDNE to infer differential gene networks associated with drug resistance in ovarian tumors, cell differentiation and breast tumor heterogeneity, the hub genes in the estimated differential gene networks can provide important insights into the underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, a Matlab toolbox, differential network analysis toolbox, was developed to implement the WDNE model and visualize the estimated differential networks.
35604082	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	webSCST: an interactive web application for single-cell RNA-sequencing data and spatial transcriptomic data integration.	SUMMARY: Integrative analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data with spatial data for the same species and organ would provide each cell sample with a predictive spatial location, which would facilitate biological study. However, publicly available spatial sequencing datasets for specific species and organs are rare and are often displayed in different formats. In this study, we introduce a new web-based scRNA-seq analysis tool, webSCST, that integrates well-organized spatial transcriptome sequencing datasets categorized by species and organs, provides a user-friendly interface for raw single-cell processing with popular integration methods and allows users to submit their raw scRNA-seq data once to obtain predicted spatial locations for each cell type. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: webSCST implemented in shiny with all major browsers supported is available at http://www.webscst.com. webSCST is also freely available as an R package at https://github.com/swsoyee/webSCST.
35637419	2022	Nature biotechnology	Fast and highly sensitive full-length single-cell RNA sequencing using FLASH-seq.	We present FLASH-seq (FS), a full-length single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) method with increased sensitivity and reduced hands-on time compared to Smart-seq3. The entire FS protocol can be performed in ~4.5 hours, is simple to automate and can be easily miniaturized to decrease resource consumption. The FS protocol can also use unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) for molecule counting while displaying reduced strand-invasion artifacts. FS will be especially useful for characterizing gene expression at high resolution across multiple samples.
41145665	2025	Nature methods	Improved reconstruction of single-cell developmental potential with CytoTRACE 2.	While single-cell RNA sequencing has advanced our understanding of cell fate, identifying molecular hallmarks of potency-a cell's ability to differentiate into other cell types-remains a challenge. Here we introduce CytoTRACE 2, an interpretable deep learning framework for predicting absolute developmental potential from single-cell RNA sequencing data. Across diverse platforms and tissues, CytoTRACE 2 outperformed previous methods in predicting developmental hierarchies, enabling detailed mapping of single-cell differentiation landscapes and expanding insights into cell potency.
31603465	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Cancer classification of single-cell gene expression data by neural network.	MOTIVATION: Cancer classification based on gene expression profiles has provided insight on the causes of cancer and cancer treatment. Recently, machine learning-based approaches have been attempted in downstream cancer analysis to address the large differences in gene expression values, as determined by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). RESULTS: We designed cancer classifiers that can identify 21 types of cancers and normal tissues based on bulk RNA-seq as well as scRNA-seq data. Training was performed with 7398 cancer samples and 640 normal samples from 21 tumors and normal tissues in TCGA based on the 300 most significant genes expressed in each cancer. Then, we compared neural network (NN), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (kNN) and random forest (RF) methods. The NN performed consistently better than other methods. We further applied our approach to scRNA-seq transformed by kNN smoothing and found that our model successfully classified cancer types and normal samples. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Cancer classification by neural network. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
34244782	2021	Nucleic acids research	PseudoGA: cell pseudotime reconstruction based on genetic algorithm.	Dynamic regulation of gene expression is often governed by progression through transient cell states. Bulk RNA-seq analysis can only detect average change in expression levels and is unable to identify this dynamics. Single cell RNA-seq presents an unprecedented opportunity that helps in placing the cells on a hypothetical time trajectory that reflects gradual transition of their transcriptomes. This continuum trajectory or 'pseudotime', may reveal the developmental pathway and provide us with information on dynamic transcriptomic changes and other biological processes. Existing approaches to build pseudotime heavily depend on reducing huge dimension to extremely low dimensional subspaces and may lead to loss of information. We propose PseudoGA, a genetic algorithm based approach to order cells assuming that gene expressions vary according to a smooth curve along the pseudotime trajectory. We observe superior accuracy of our method in simulated as well as benchmarking real datasets. Generality of the assumption behind PseudoGA and no dependence on dimensionality reduction technique make it a robust choice for pseudotime estimation from single cell transcriptome data. PseudoGA is also time efficient when applied to a large single cell RNA-seq data and adaptable to parallel computing. R code for PseudoGA is freely available at https://github.com/indranillab/pseudoga.
37225419	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	An interpretable single-cell RNA sequencing data clustering method based on latent Dirichlet allocation.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) detects whole transcriptome signals for large amounts of individual cells and is powerful for determining cell-to-cell differences and investigating the functional characteristics of various cell types. scRNA-seq datasets are usually sparse and highly noisy. Many steps in the scRNA-seq analysis workflow, including reasonable gene selection, cell clustering and annotation, as well as discovering the underlying biological mechanisms from such datasets, are difficult. In this study, we proposed an scRNA-seq analysis method based on the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model. The LDA model estimates a series of latent variables, i.e. putative functions (PFs), from the input raw cell-gene data. Thus, we incorporated the 'cell-function-gene' three-layer framework into scRNA-seq analysis, as this framework is capable of discovering latent and complex gene expression patterns via a built-in model approach and obtaining biologically meaningful results through a data-driven functional interpretation process. We compared our method with four classic methods on seven benchmark scRNA-seq datasets. The LDA-based method performed best in the cell clustering test in terms of both accuracy and purity. By analysing three complex public datasets, we demonstrated that our method could distinguish cell types with multiple levels of functional specialization, and precisely reconstruct cell development trajectories. Moreover, the LDA-based method accurately identified the representative PFs and the representative genes for the cell types/cell stages, enabling data-driven cell cluster annotation and functional interpretation. According to the literature, most of the previously reported marker/functionally relevant genes were recognized.
40462200	2025	Genome biology	Transcriptional analysis of metastatic hormone-naive prostate cancer primary tumor biopsies reveals a relevant role for SOX11 in prostate cancer cell dissemination.	BACKGROUND: Metastatic hormone-naive prostate cancer (mHNPC) is an infrequent form of this tumor type that is characterized by metastasis at the time of diagnosis and accounts for up to 50% of prostate cancer-related deaths. Despite the extensive characterization of localized and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, the molecular characteristics of mHNPC remain largely unexplored. RESULTS: Here, we provide the first extensive transcriptomics characterization of primary tumor specimens from patients with mHNPC. We generate discovery and validation bulk and single-cell RNA-seq datasets and perform integrative computational analysis in combination with experimental studies. Our results provide unprecedented evidence of the distinctive transcriptional profile of mHNPC and identify stroma remodeling as a predominant feature of these tumors. Importantly, we discover a central role for the SRY-box transcription factor 11 (SOX11) in triggering a heterotypic communication that is associated with the acquisition of metastatic properties. CONCLUSIONS: Our study will constitute an invaluable resource for a profound understanding of mHNPC that can influence patient management.
30256981	2019	Nucleic acids research	Targeting individual cells by barcode in pooled sequence libraries.	Transcriptional profiling of thousands of single cells in parallel by RNA-seq is now routine. However, due to reliance on pooled library preparation, targeting analysis to particular cells of interest is difficult. Here, we present a multiplexed PCR method for targeted sequencing of select cells from pooled single-cell sequence libraries. We demonstrated this molecular enrichment method on multiple cell types within pooled single-cell RNA-seq libraries produced from primary human blood cells. We show how molecular enrichment can be combined with FACS to efficiently target ultra-rare cell types, such as the recently identified AXL+SIGLEC6+ dendritic cell (AS DC) subset, in order to reduce the required sequencing effort to profile single cells by 100-fold. Our results demonstrate that DNA barcodes identifying cells within pooled sequencing libraries can be used as targets to enrich for specific molecules of interest, for example reads from a set of target cells.
40399693	2025	Nature biotechnology	A multi-kingdom genetic barcoding system for precise clone isolation.	Cell-tagging strategies with DNA barcodes have enabled the analysis of clone size dynamics and clone-restricted transcriptomic landscapes in heterogeneous populations. However, isolating a target clone that displays a specific phenotype from a complex population remains challenging. Here we present a multi-kingdom genetic barcoding system, CloneSelect, which enables a target cell clone to be triggered to express a reporter gene for isolation through barcode-specific CRISPR base editing. In CloneSelect, cells are first stably tagged with DNA barcodes and propagated so that their subpopulation can be subjected to a given experiment. A clone that shows a phenotype or genotype of interest at a given time can then be isolated from the initial or subsequent cell pools stored during the experiment using CRISPR base editing. CloneSelect is scalable and compatible with single-cell RNA sequencing. We demonstrate the versatility of CloneSelect in human embryonic kidney 293T cells, mouse embryonic stem cells, human pluripotent stem cells, yeast cells and bacterial cells.
33428615	2021	PLoS computational biology	Preprocessing choices affect RNA velocity results for droplet scRNA-seq data.	Experimental single-cell approaches are becoming widely used for many purposes, including investigation of the dynamic behaviour of developing biological systems. Consequently, a large number of computational methods for extracting dynamic information from such data have been developed. One example is RNA velocity analysis, in which spliced and unspliced RNA abundances are jointly modeled in order to infer a 'direction of change' and thereby a future state for each cell in the gene expression space. Naturally, the accuracy and interpretability of the inferred RNA velocities depend crucially on the correctness of the estimated abundances. Here, we systematically compare five widely used quantification tools, in total yielding thirteen different quantification approaches, in terms of their estimates of spliced and unspliced RNA abundances in five experimental droplet scRNA-seq data sets. We show that there are substantial differences between the quantifications obtained from different tools, and identify typical genes for which such discrepancies are observed. We further show that these abundance differences propagate to the downstream analysis, and can have a large effect on estimated velocities as well as the biological interpretation. Our results highlight that abundance quantification is a crucial aspect of the RNA velocity analysis workflow, and that both the definition of the genomic features of interest and the quantification algorithm itself require careful consideration.
33837131	2021	Genome research	Automated quality control and cell identification of droplet-based single-cell data using dropkick.	A major challenge for droplet-based single-cell sequencing technologies is distinguishing true cells from uninformative barcodes in data sets with disparate library sizes confounded by high technical noise (i.e., batch-specific ambient RNA). We present dropkick, a fully automated software tool for quality control and filtering of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data with a focus on excluding ambient barcodes and recovering real cells bordering the quality threshold. By automatically determining data set-specific training labels based on predictive global heuristics, dropkick learns a gene-based representation of real cells and ambient noise, calculating a cell probability score for each barcode. Using simulated and real-world scRNA-seq data, we benchmarked dropkick against conventional thresholding approaches and EmptyDrops, a popular computational method, showing greater recovery of rare cell types and exclusion of empty droplets and noisy, uninformative barcodes. We show for both low- and high-background data sets that dropkick's weakly supervised model reliably learns which genes are enriched in ambient barcodes and draws a multidimensional boundary that is more robust to data set-specific variation than existing filtering approaches. dropkick provides a fast, automated tool for reproducible cell identification from scRNA-seq data that is critical to downstream analysis and compatible with popular single-cell Python packages.
35361264	2022	Genome biology	Decoding the multicellular ecosystem of vena caval tumor thrombus in clear cell renal cell carcinoma by single-cell RNA sequencing.	BACKGROUND: Vascular invasion with tumor thrombus frequently occurs in advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Thrombectomy is one of the most challenging surgeries with high rate of perioperative morbidity and mortality. However, the mechanisms driving tumor thrombus formation are poorly understood which is required for designing effective therapy for eliminating tumor thrombus. RESULTS: We perform single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of 19 surgical tissue specimens from 8 clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) patients with tumor thrombus. We observe tumor thrombus has increased tissue resident CD8(+) T cells with a progenitor exhausted phenotype compared with the matched primary tumors. Remarkably, macrophages, malignant cells, endothelial cells and myofibroblasts from TTs exhibit enhanced remodeling of the extracellular matrix. The macrophages and malignant cells from primary tumors represent proinflammatory states, but also increase the expression of immunosuppressive markers compared to tumor thrombus. Finally, differential gene expression and interaction analyses reveal that tumor-stroma interplay reshapes the extracellular matrix in tumor thrombus associated with poor survival. CONCLUSIONS: Our comprehensive picture of the ecosystem of ccRCC with tumor thrombus provides deeper insights into the mechanisms of tumor thrombus formation, which may aid in the design of effective neoadjuvant therapy to promote downstaging of tumor thrombus and decrease the perioperative morbidity and mortality of thrombectomy.
40977264	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	scHSC: enhancing single-cell RNA-seq clustering via hard sample contrastive learning.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides high-throughput information about the genome-wide gene expression levels at the single-cell resolution, bringing a precise understanding on the transcriptome of individual cells. Unfortunately, the rapidly growing scRNA-seq data and the prevalence of dropout events pose substantial challenges for clustering and cell type annotation. Here, we propose a deep learning method, scHSC, that employs hard sample mining through contrastive learning for clustering scRNA-seq data. Focusing on hard samples, this approach simultaneously integrates gene expression and topological structure information between cells to improve clustering accuracy. By adjusting the weights of hard positive and hard negative samples during the iterative training process, scHSC employs an adaptive weighting strategy to integrate contrastive learning with a ZINB model for single-cell clustering tasks. Extensive experiments on 18 single-cell RNA-seq real datasets demonstrate that scHSC exhibits significant superiority in clustering performance compared to existing deep learning-based clustering methods. scHSC is implemented in Python based on the PyTorch framework. The source code and datasets are available via https://github.com/fangs25/scHSC.
35172334	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	Deep structural clustering for single-cell RNA-seq data jointly through autoencoder and graph neural network.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) permits researchers to study the complex mechanisms of cell heterogeneity and diversity. Unsupervised clustering is of central importance for the analysis of the scRNA-seq data, as it can be used to identify putative cell types. However, due to noise impacts, high dimensionality and pervasive dropout events, clustering analysis of scRNA-seq data remains a computational challenge. Here, we propose a new deep structural clustering method for scRNA-seq data, named scDSC, which integrate the structural information into deep clustering of single cells. The proposed scDSC consists of a Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) model-based autoencoder, a graph neural network (GNN) module and a mutual-supervised module. To learn the data representation from the sparse and zero-inflated scRNA-seq data, we add a ZINB model to the basic autoencoder. The GNN module is introduced to capture the structural information among cells. By joining the ZINB-based autoencoder with the GNN module, the model transfers the data representation learned by autoencoder to the corresponding GNN layer. Furthermore, we adopt a mutual supervised strategy to unify these two different deep neural architectures and to guide the clustering task. Extensive experimental results on six real scRNA-seq datasets demonstrate that scDSC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of clustering accuracy and scalability. Our method scDSC is implemented in Python using the Pytorch machine-learning library, and it is freely available at https://github.com/DHUDBlab/scDSC.
36585783	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Inferring gene regulatory networks from single-cell gene expression data via deep multi-view contrastive learning.	The inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is of great importance for understanding the complex regulatory mechanisms within cells. The emergence of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies enables the measure of gene expression levels for individual cells, which promotes the reconstruction of GRNs at single-cell resolution. However, existing network inference methods are mainly designed for data collected from a single data source, which ignores the information provided by multiple related data sources. In this paper, we propose a multi-view contrastive learning (DeepMCL) model to infer GRNs from scRNA-seq data collected from multiple data sources or time points. We first represent each gene pair as a set of histogram images, and then introduce a deep Siamese convolutional neural network with contrastive loss to learn the low-dimensional embedding for each gene pair. Moreover, an attention mechanism is introduced to integrate the embeddings extracted from different data sources and different neighbor gene pairs. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our contrastive learning and attention mechanisms, demonstrating the effectiveness of our model in integrating multiple data sources for GRN inference.
37144467	2023	Nucleic acids research	Redefining normal breast cell populations using long noncoding RNAs.	Single-cell RNAseq has allowed unprecedented insight into gene expression across different cell populations in normal tissue and disease states. However, almost all studies rely on annotated gene sets to capture gene expression levels and sequencing reads that do not align to known genes are discarded. Here, we discover thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) expressed in human mammary epithelial cells and analyze their expression in individual cells of the normal breast. We show that lncRNA expression alone can discriminate between luminal and basal cell types and define subpopulations of both compartments. Clustering cells based on lncRNA expression identified additional basal subpopulations, compared to clustering based on annotated gene expression, suggesting that lncRNAs can provide an additional layer of information to better distinguish breast cell subpopulations. In contrast, these breast-specific lncRNAs poorly distinguish brain cell populations, highlighting the need to annotate tissue-specific lncRNAs prior to expression analyses. We also identified a panel of 100 breast lncRNAs that could discern breast cancer subtypes better than protein-coding markers. Overall, our results suggest that lncRNAs are an unexplored resource for new biomarker and therapeutic target discovery in the normal breast and breast cancer subtypes.

Mapping the query cells onto a well-constructed reference atlas, known as reference mapping, enables robust, reproducible interpretation of new single-cell RNA-seq data in the context of curated and annotated cell subtypes and states. However, existing methods often rely on complex integration frameworks or require re-access to raw data, limiting their applicability and reproducibility. To address this, we introduce ProjectSVR, a machine learning-based framework that formulates reference mapping as a multi-target regression task. By leveraging ensemble support vector regression (SVR) to learn the relationship between gene set activity scores and low-dimensional reference embeddings, ProjectSVR enables platform-agnostic and integration-independent mapping. Benchmarking across diverse biological contexts-including immune responses, developmental trajectories, and disease states-demonstrates that ProjectSVR achieves comparable accuracy and robustness to state-of-the-art methods, with reduced dependence on data-specific preprocessing. Our findings demonstrate that ProjectSVR is a valuable tool for reference mapping, considerably simplifying the analysis of scRNA-seq data when well-constructed reference atlases are available.
32833968	2020	PLoS computational biology	A novel single-cell based method for breast cancer prognosis.	Breast cancer prognosis is challenging due to the heterogeneity of the disease. Various computational methods using bulk RNA-seq data have been proposed for breast cancer prognosis. However, these methods suffer from limited performances or ambiguous biological relevance, as a result of the neglect of intra-tumor heterogeneity. Recently, single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged for studying tumor heterogeneity at cellular levels. In this paper, we propose a novel method, scPrognosis, to improve breast cancer prognosis with scRNA-seq data. scPrognosis uses the scRNA-seq data of the biological process Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). It firstly infers the EMT pseudotime and a dynamic gene co-expression network, then uses an integrative model to select genes important in EMT based on their expression variation and differentiation in different stages of EMT, and their roles in the dynamic gene co-expression network. To validate and apply the selected signatures to breast cancer prognosis, we use them as the features to build a prediction model with bulk RNA-seq data. The experimental results show that scPrognosis outperforms other benchmark breast cancer prognosis methods that use bulk RNA-seq data. Moreover, the dynamic changes in the expression of the selected signature genes in EMT may provide clues to the link between EMT and clinical outcomes of breast cancer. scPrognosis will also be useful when applied to scRNA-seq datasets of different biological processes other than EMT.
31658262	2019	PLoS computational biology	SCMarker: Ab initio marker selection for single cell transcriptome profiling.	Single-cell RNA-sequencing data generated by a variety of technologies, such as Drop-seq and SMART-seq, can reveal simultaneously the mRNA transcript levels of thousands of genes in thousands of cells. It is often important to identify informative genes or cell-type-discriminative markers to reduce dimensionality and achieve informative cell typing results. We present an ab initio method that performs unsupervised marker selection by identifying genes that have subpopulation-discriminative expression levels and are co- or mutually-exclusively expressed with other genes. Consistent improvements in cell-type classification and biologically meaningful marker selection are achieved by applying SCMarker on various datasets in multiple tissue types, followed by a variety of clustering algorithms. The source code of SCMarker is publicly available at https://github.com/KChen-lab/SCMarker.
35362510	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	A high-throughput single cell-based antibody discovery approach against the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein suggests a lack of neutralizing antibodies targeting the highly conserved S2 domain.	Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic continues globally with a growing number of infections, but there are currently no effective antibody drugs against the virus. In addition, 90% amino acid sequence identity between the S2 subunit of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and SARS-CoV S proteins attracts us to examine S2-targeted cross-neutralizing antibodies that are not yet well defined. We therefore immunized RenMab mice with the full-length S protein and constructed a high-throughput antibody discovery method based on single-cell sequencing technology to isolate SARS-CoV-2 S-targeted neutralizing antibodies and cross-neutralizing antibodies against the S2 region of SARS-CoV-2/SARS-CoV S. Diversity of antibody sequences in RenMab mice and consistency in B-cell immune responses between RenMab mice and humans enabled screening of fully human virus-neutralizing antibodies. From all the frequency >1 paired clonotypes obtained from single-cell V(D)J sequencing, 215 antibodies with binding affinities were identified and primarily bound S2. However, only two receptor-binding domain-targeted clonotypes had neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, 5' single-cell RNA sequencing indicated that these sorted splenic B cells are mainly plasmablasts, germinal center (GC)-dependent memory B-cells and GC B-cells. Among them, plasmablasts and GC-dependent memory B-cells were considered the most significant possibility of producing virus-specific antibodies. Altogether, using a high-throughput single cell-based antibody discovery approach, our study highlighted the challenges of developing S2-binding neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and provided a novel direction for the enrichment of antigen-specific B-cells.
35758814	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Visualizing hierarchies in scRNA-seq data using a density tree-biased autoencoder.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows studying the development of cells in unprecedented detail. Given that many cellular differentiation processes are hierarchical, their scRNA-seq data are expected to be approximately tree-shaped in gene expression space. Inference and representation of this tree structure in two dimensions is highly desirable for biological interpretation and exploratory analysis. RESULTS: Our two contributions are an approach for identifying a meaningful tree structure from high-dimensional scRNA-seq data, and a visualization method respecting the tree structure. We extract the tree structure by means of a density-based maximum spanning tree on a vector quantization of the data and show that it captures biological information well. We then introduce density-tree biased autoencoder (DTAE), a tree-biased autoencoder that emphasizes the tree structure of the data in low dimensional space. We compare to other dimension reduction methods and demonstrate the success of our method both qualitatively and quantitatively on real and toy data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Our implementation relying on PyTorch and Higra is available at github.com/hci-unihd/DTAE. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
39997221	2025	Nucleic acids research	Shiba: a versatile computational method for systematic identification of differential RNA splicing across platforms.	Alternative pre-mRNA splicing (AS) is a fundamental regulatory process that generates transcript diversity and cell type variation. We developed Shiba, a comprehensive method that integrates transcript assembly, splicing event identification, read counting, and differential splicing analysis across RNA-seq platforms. Shiba excels in capturing annotated and unannotated AS events with superior accuracy, sensitivity, and reproducibility. It addresses the often-overlooked issue of junction read imbalance, significantly reducing false positives to aid target prioritization and downstream analyses. Unlike other tools that require large numbers of biological replicates or resulting in low sensitivity and high false positives, Shiba's statistics framework is agnostic to sample size, as demonstrated by simulated data and its effective application to real n= 1 RNA-seq datasets. To extend its utility to single-cell RNA-seq, we developed scShiba, which applies Shiba's pseudobulk approach to analyze splicing at the cluster level. scShiba successfully revealed AS regulation in developmental dopaminergic neurons and differences between excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Both Shiba and scShiba are available in Docker/Singularity containers and Snakemake pipelines, ensuring reproducibility. With their comprehensive capabilities, Shiba and scShiba enable systematic quantification of alternative splicing events across various platforms, laying a solid foundation for mechanistic exploration of the functional complexity in RNA splicing.
33249453	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	FR-Match: robust matching of cell type clusters from single cell RNA sequencing data using the Friedman-Rafsky non-parametric test.	Single cell/nucleus RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) is emerging as an essential tool to unravel the phenotypic heterogeneity of cells in complex biological systems. While computational methods for scRNAseq cell type clustering have advanced, the ability to integrate datasets to identify common and novel cell types across experiments remains a challenge. Here, we introduce a cluster-to-cluster cell type matching method-FR-Match-that utilizes supervised feature selection for dimensionality reduction and incorporates shared information among cells to determine whether two cell type clusters share the same underlying multivariate gene expression distribution. FR-Match is benchmarked with existing cell-to-cell and cell-to-cluster cell type matching methods using both simulated and real scRNAseq data. FR-Match proved to be a stringent method that produced fewer erroneous matches of distinct cell subtypes and had the unique ability to identify novel cell phenotypes in new datasets. In silico validation demonstrated that the proposed workflow is the only self-contained algorithm that was robust to increasing numbers of true negatives (i.e. non-represented cell types). FR-Match was applied to two human brain scRNAseq datasets sampled from cortical layer 1 and full thickness middle temporal gyrus. When mapping cell types identified in specimens isolated from these overlapping human brain regions, FR-Match precisely recapitulated the laminar characteristics of matched cell type clusters, reflecting their distinct neuroanatomical distributions. An R package and Shiny application are provided at https://github.com/JCVenterInstitute/FRmatch for users to interactively explore and match scRNAseq cell type clusters with complementary visualization tools.
41310055	2025	Nature methods	FX-Cell: a method for single-cell RNA sequencing on difficult-to-digest and cryopreserved plant samples.	Single-cell RNA sequencing in plants requires the isolation of high-quality protoplasts-cells devoid of cell walls. However, many plant tissues and organs are resistant to enzymatic digestion, posing a significant barrier to advancing single-cell multi-omics in plant research. Furthermore, for field-grown crops, the lack of immediate laboratory facilities presents another major challenge for timely protoplast preparation. Here, to address these limitations, we developed FX-Cell and its derivatives, FXcryo-Cell and cryoFX-Cell, to enable single-cell RNA sequencing with both difficult-to-digest and cryopreserved plant samples. By optimizing the fixation buffer and minimizing RNA degradation, our approach ensures efficient cell wall digestion at high temperatures while maintaining high-quality single cells, even after long-term storage at -80  degrees C, and circumvents use of nuclei, which are not representative of the pool of translatable messenger RNAs. We successfully constructed high-quality cell atlases for rice tiller nodes, rhizomes of wild rice and maize crown roots grown under field conditions. Moreover, these methods enable the accurate reconstruction of plant acute wounding responses at single-cell resolution. Collectively, these advancements expand the applicability of plant single-cell genomics across a wider range of species and tissues, paving the way for comprehensive Plant Cell Atlases for plant species.
28934479	2017	Nucleic acids research	Targeted reconstruction of T cell receptor sequence from single cell RNA-seq links CDR3 length to T cell differentiation state.	The T cell compartment must contain diversity in both T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire and cell state to provide effective immunity against pathogens. However, it remains unclear how differences in the TCR contribute to heterogeneity in T cell state. Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) can allow simultaneous measurement of TCR sequence and global transcriptional profile from single cells. However, current methods for TCR inference from scRNA-seq are limited in their sensitivity and require long sequencing reads, thus increasing the cost and decreasing the number of cells that can be feasibly analyzed. Here we present TRAPeS, a publicly available tool that can efficiently extract TCR sequence information from short-read scRNA-seq libraries. We apply it to investigate heterogeneity in the CD8+ T cell response in humans and mice, and show that it is accurate and more sensitive than existing approaches. Coupling TRAPeS with transcriptome analysis of CD8+ T cells specific for a single epitope from Yellow Fever Virus (YFV), we show that the recently described 'naive-like' memory population have significantly longer CDR3 regions and greater divergence from germline sequence than do effector-memory phenotype cells. This suggests that TCR usage is associated with the differentiation state of the CD8+ T cell response to YFV.
33288904	2021	Nature biotechnology	Highly sensitive spatial transcriptomics at near-cellular resolution with Slide-seqV2.	Measurement of the location of molecules in tissues is essential for understanding tissue formation and function. Previously, we developed Slide-seq, a technology that enables transcriptome-wide detection of RNAs with a spatial resolution of 10 mum. Here we report Slide-seqV2, which combines improvements in library generation, bead synthesis and array indexing to reach an RNA capture efficiency ~50% that of single-cell RNA-seq data (~10-fold greater than Slide-seq), approaching the detection efficiency of droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq techniques. First, we leverage the detection efficiency of Slide-seqV2 to identify dendritically localized mRNAs in neurons of the mouse hippocampus. Second, we integrate the spatial information of Slide-seqV2 data with single-cell trajectory analysis tools to characterize the spatiotemporal development of the mouse neocortex, identifying underlying genetic programs that were poorly sampled with Slide-seq. The combination of near-cellular resolution and high transcript detection efficiency makes Slide-seqV2 useful across many experimental contexts.
38273415	2024	Genome biology	Gene panel selection for targeted spatial transcriptomics.	Targeted spatial transcriptomics hold particular promise in analyzing complex tissues. Most such methods, however, measure only a limited panel of transcripts, which need to be selected in advance to inform on the cell types or processes being studied. A limitation of existing gene selection methods is their reliance on scRNA-seq data, ignoring platform effects between technologies. Here we describe gpsFISH, a computational method performing gene selection through optimizing detection of known cell types. By modeling and adjusting for platform effects, gpsFISH outperforms other methods. Furthermore, gpsFISH can incorporate cell type hierarchies and custom gene preferences to accommodate diverse design requirements.
36592058	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	scGMAAE: Gaussian mixture adversarial autoencoders for diversification analysis of scRNA-seq data.	The progress of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has led to a large number of scRNA-seq data, which are widely used in biomedical research. The noise in the raw data and tens of thousands of genes pose a challenge to capture the real structure and effective information of scRNA-seq data. Most of the existing single-cell analysis methods assume that the low-dimensional embedding of the raw data belongs to a Gaussian distribution or a low-dimensional nonlinear space without any prior information, which limits the flexibility and controllability of the model to a great extent. In addition, many existing methods need high computational cost, which makes them difficult to be used to deal with large-scale datasets. Here, we design and develop a depth generation model named Gaussian mixture adversarial autoencoders (scGMAAE), assuming that the low-dimensional embedding of different types of cells follows different Gaussian distributions, integrating Bayesian variational inference and adversarial training, as to give the interpretable latent representation of complex data and discover the statistical distribution of different types of cells. The scGMAAE is provided with good controllability, interpretability and scalability. Therefore, it can process large-scale datasets in a short time and give competitive results. scGMAAE outperforms existing methods in several ways, including dimensionality reduction visualization, cell clustering, differential expression analysis and batch effect removal. Importantly, compared with most deep learning methods, scGMAAE requires less iterations to generate the best results.
40038818	2025	Genome biology	Benchmarking single-cell cross-omics imputation methods for surface protein expression.	BACKGROUND: Recent advances in single-cell multimodal omics sequencing have facilitated the simultaneous profiling of transcriptomes and surface proteomes within individual cells, offering insights into cellular functions and heterogeneity. However, the high costs and technical complexity of protocols like CITE-seq and REAP-seq constrain large-scale dataset generation. To overcome this limitation, surface protein data imputation methods have emerged to predict protein abundances from scRNA-seq data. RESULTS: We present a comprehensive benchmark of twelve state-of-the-art imputation methods across eleven datasets and six scenarios. Our analysis evaluates the methods' accuracy, sensitivity to training data size, robustness across experiments, and usability in terms of running time, memory usage, popularity, and user-friendliness. With benchmark experiments in diverse scenarios and a comprehensive evaluation framework of the results, our study offers valuable insights into the performance and applicability of surface protein data imputation methods in single-cell omics research. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our results, Seurat v4 (PCA) and Seurat v3 (PCA) demonstrate exceptional performance, offering promising avenues for further research in single-cell omics.
37429993	2023	Nature methods	Significance analysis for clustering with single-cell RNA-sequencing data.	Unsupervised clustering of single-cell RNA-sequencing data enables the identification of distinct cell populations. However, the most widely used clustering algorithms are heuristic and do not formally account for statistical uncertainty. We find that not addressing known sources of variability in a statistically rigorous manner can lead to overconfidence in the discovery of novel cell types. Here we extend a previous method, significance of hierarchical clustering, to propose a model-based hypothesis testing approach that incorporates significance analysis into the clustering algorithm and permits statistical evaluation of clusters as distinct cell populations. We also adapt this approach to permit statistical assessment on the clusters reported by any algorithm. Finally, we extend these approaches to account for batch structure. We benchmarked our approach against popular clustering workflows, demonstrating improved performance. To show practical utility, we applied our approach to the Human Lung Cell Atlas and an atlas of the mouse cerebellar cortex, identifying several cases of over-clustering and recapitulating experimentally validated cell type definitions.
40184563	2025	PLoS computational biology	scTrans: Sparse attention powers fast and accurate cell type annotation in single-cell RNA-seq data.	Cell type annotation is crucial in single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis because it enables significant biological discoveries and deepens our understanding of tissue biology. Given the high-dimensional and highly sparse nature of single-cell RNA sequencing data, most existing annotation tools focus on highly variable genes to reduce dimensionality and computational load. However, this approach inevitably results in information loss, potentially weakening the model's generalization performance and adaptability to novel datasets. To mitigate this issue, we developed scTrans, a single cell Transformer-based model, which employs sparse attention to utilize all non-zero genes, thereby effectively reducing the input data dimensionality while minimizing information loss. We validated the speed and accuracy of scTrans by performing cell type annotation on 31 different tissues within the Mouse Cell Atlas. Remarkably, even with datasets nearing a million cells, scTrans efficiently perform cell type annotation in limited computational resources. Furthermore, scTrans demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, accurately annotating cells in novel datasets and generating high-quality latent representations, which are essential for precise clustering and trajectory analysis.
34553763	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	High-throughput single-cell RNA-seq data imputation and characterization with surrogate-assisted automated deep learning.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have been heavily developed to probe gene expression profiles at single-cell resolution. Deep imputation methods have been proposed to address the related computational challenges (e.g. the gene sparsity in single-cell data). In particular, the neural architectures of those deep imputation models have been proven to be critical for performance. However, deep imputation architectures are difficult to design and tune for those without rich knowledge of deep neural networks and scRNA-seq. Therefore, Surrogate-assisted Evolutionary Deep Imputation Model (SEDIM) is proposed to automatically design the architectures of deep neural networks for imputing gene expression levels in scRNA-seq data without any manual tuning. Moreover, the proposed SEDIM constructs an offline surrogate model, which can accelerate the computational efficiency of the architectural search. Comprehensive studies show that SEDIM significantly improves the imputation and clustering performance compared with other benchmark methods. In addition, we also extensively explore the performance of SEDIM in other contexts and platforms including mass cytometry and metabolic profiling in a comprehensive manner. Marker gene detection, gene ontology enrichment and pathological analysis are conducted to provide novel insights into cell-type identification and the underlying mechanisms. The source code is available at https://github.com/li-shaochuan/SEDIM.
37055623	2024	Nature biotechnology	Dandelion uses the single-cell adaptive immune receptor repertoire to explore lymphocyte developmental origins.	Assessment of single-cell gene expression (single-cell RNA sequencing) and adaptive immune receptor (AIR) sequencing (scVDJ-seq) has been invaluable in studying lymphocyte biology. Here we introduce Dandelion, a computational pipeline for scVDJ-seq analysis. It enables the application of standard V(D)J analysis workflows to single-cell datasets, delivering improved V(D)J contig annotation and the identification of nonproductive and partially spliced contigs. We devised a strategy to create an AIR feature space that can be used for both differential V(D)J usage analysis and pseudotime trajectory inference. The application of Dandelion improved the alignment of human thymic development trajectories of double-positive T cells to mature single-positive CD4/CD8 T cells, generating predictions of factors regulating lineage commitment. Dandelion analysis of other cell compartments provided insights into the origins of human B1 cells and ILC/NK cell development, illustrating the power of our approach. Dandelion is available at https://www.github.com/zktuong/dandelion .
37122068	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	SSNMDI: a novel joint learning model of semi-supervised non-negative matrix factorization and data imputation for clustering of single-cell RNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology attracts extensive attention in the biomedical field. It can be used to measure gene expression and analyze the transcriptome at the single-cell level, enabling the identification of cell types based on unsupervised clustering. Data imputation and dimension reduction are conducted before clustering because scRNA-seq has a high 'dropout' rate, noise and linear inseparability. However, independence of dimension reduction, imputation and clustering cannot fully characterize the pattern of the scRNA-seq data, resulting in poor clustering performance. Herein, we propose a novel and accurate algorithm, SSNMDI, that utilizes a joint learning approach to simultaneously perform imputation, dimensionality reduction and cell clustering in a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) framework. In addition, we integrate the cell annotation as prior information, then transform the joint learning into a semi-supervised NMF model. Through experiments on 14 datasets, we demonstrate that SSNMDI has a faster convergence speed, better dimensionality reduction performance and a more accurate cell clustering performance than previous methods, providing an accurate and robust strategy for analyzing scRNA-seq data. Biological analysis are also conducted to validate the biological significance of our method, including pseudotime analysis, gene ontology and survival analysis. We believe that we are among the first to introduce imputation, partial label information, dimension reduction and clustering to the single-cell field. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code for SSNMDI is available at https://github.com/yushanqiu/SSNMDI.
31778143	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	CellBench: R/Bioconductor software for comparing single-cell RNA-seq analysis methods.	MOTIVATION: Bioinformatic analysis of single-cell gene expression data is a rapidly evolving field. Hundreds of bespoke methods have been developed in the past few years to deal with various aspects of single-cell analysis and consensus on the most appropriate methods to use under different settings is still emerging. Benchmarking the many methods is therefore of critical importance and since analysis of single-cell data usually involves multi-step pipelines, effective evaluation of pipelines involving different combinations of methods is required. Current benchmarks of single-cell methods are mostly implemented with ad-hoc code that is often difficult to reproduce or extend, and exhaustive manual coding of many combinations is infeasible in most instances. Therefore, new software is needed to manage pipeline benchmarking. RESULTS: The CellBench R software facilitates method comparisons in either a task-centric or combinatorial way to allow pipelines of methods to be evaluated in an effective manner. CellBench automatically runs combinations of methods, provides facilities for measuring running time and delivers output in tabular form which is highly compatible with tidyverse R packages for summary and visualization. Our software has enabled comprehensive benchmarking of single-cell RNA-seq normalization, imputation, clustering, trajectory analysis and data integration methods using various performance metrics obtained from data with available ground truth. CellBench is also amenable to benchmarking other bioinformatics analysis tasks. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Available from https://bioconductor.org/packages/CellBench.
41325434	2025	PLoS computational biology	Long-read sequencing transcriptome quantification with lr-kallisto.	"RNA abundance quantification has become routine and affordable thanks to high-throughput ""short-read"" technologies that provide accurate molecule counts at the gene level. Similarly accurate and affordable quantification of definitive full-length, transcript isoforms has remained a stubborn challenge, despite its obvious biological significance across a wide range of problems. ""Long-read"" sequencing platforms now produce data-types that can, in principle, drive routine definitive isoform quantification. However some particulars of contemporary long-read datatypes, together with isoform complexity and genetic variation, present bioinformatic challenges. We show here, using ONT data, that fast and accurate quantification of long-read data is possible and that it is improved by exome capture. To perform quantifications we developed lr-kallisto, which adapts the kallisto bulk and single-cell RNA-seq quantification methods for long-read technologies."
28025200	2017	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Falco: a quick and flexible single-cell RNA-seq processing framework on the cloud.	SUMMARY: Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) is increasingly used in a range of biomedical studies. Nonetheless, current RNA-seq analysis tools are not specifically designed to efficiently process scRNA-seq data due to their limited scalability. Here we introduce Falco, a cloud-based framework to enable paralellization of existing RNA-seq processing pipelines using big data technologies of Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark for performing massively parallel analysis of large scale transcriptomic data. Using two public scRNA-seq datasets and two popular RNA-seq alignment/feature quantification pipelines, we show that the same processing pipeline runs 2.6-145.4 times faster using Falco than running on a highly optimized standalone computer. Falco also allows users to utilize low-cost spot instances of Amazon Web Services, providing a  approximately 65% reduction in cost of analysis. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Falco is available via a GNU General Public License at https://github.com/VCCRI/Falco/. CONTACT: j.ho@victorchang.edu.au. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
34291282	2021	Nucleic acids research	Codependency and mutual exclusivity for gene community detection from sparse single-cell transcriptome data.	Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) can be used to characterize cellular heterogeneity in thousands of cells. The reconstruction of a gene network based on coexpression patterns is a fundamental task in scRNA-seq analyses, and the mutual exclusivity of gene expression can be critical for understanding such heterogeneity. Here, we propose an approach for detecting communities from a genetic network constructed on the basis of coexpression properties. The community-based comparison of multiple coexpression networks enables the identification of functionally related gene clusters that cannot be fully captured through differential gene expression-based analysis. We also developed a novel metric referred to as the exclusively expressed index (EEI) that identifies mutually exclusive gene pairs from sparse scRNA-seq data. EEI quantifies and ranks the exclusive expression levels of all gene pairs from binary expression patterns while maintaining robustness against a low sequencing depth. We applied our methods to glioblastoma scRNA-seq data and found that gene communities were partially conserved after serum stimulation despite a considerable number of differentially expressed genes. We also demonstrate that the identification of mutually exclusive gene sets with EEI can improve the sensitivity of capturing cellular heterogeneity. Our methods complement existing approaches and provide new biological insights, even for a large, sparse dataset, in the single-cell analysis field.
33767393	2021	Nature biotechnology	Robust integration of multiple single-cell RNA sequencing datasets using a single reference space.	In many biological applications of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), an integrated analysis of data from multiple batches or studies is necessary. Current methods typically achieve integration using shared cell types or covariance correlation between datasets, which can distort biological signals. Here we introduce an algorithm that uses the gene eigenvectors from a reference dataset to establish a global frame for integration. Using simulated and real datasets, we demonstrate that this approach, called Reference Principal Component Integration (RPCI), consistently outperforms other methods by multiple metrics, with clear advantages in preserving genuine cross-sample gene expression differences in matching cell types, such as those present in cells at distinct developmental stages or in perturbated versus control studies. Moreover, RPCI maintains this robust performance when multiple datasets are integrated. Finally, we applied RPCI to scRNA-seq data for mouse gut endoderm development and revealed temporal emergence of genetic programs helping establish the anterior-posterior axis in visceral endoderm.
36124665	2022	Nucleic acids research	Density-based detection of cell transition states to construct disparate and bifurcating trajectories.	Tree- and linear-shaped cell differentiation trajectories have been widely observed in developmental biologies and can be also inferred through computational methods from single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets. However, trajectories with complicated topologies such as loops, disparate lineages and bifurcating hierarchy remain difficult to infer accurately. Here, we introduce a density-based trajectory inference method capable of constructing diverse shapes of topological patterns including the most intriguing bifurcations. The novelty of our method is a step to exploit overlapping probability distributions to identify transition states of cells for determining connectability between cell clusters, and another step to infer a stable trajectory through a base-topology guided iterative fitting. Our method precisely re-constructed various benchmark reference trajectories. As a case study to demonstrate practical usefulness, our method was tested on single-cell RNA sequencing profiles of blood cells of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. We not only re-discovered the linear trajectory bridging the transition from IgM plasmablast cells to developing neutrophils, and also found a previously-undiscovered lineage which can be rigorously supported by differentially expressed gene analysis.
25712092	2015	Nucleic acids research	Assessing the prevalence of mycoplasma contamination in cell culture via a survey of NCBI's RNA-seq archive.	Mycoplasmas are notorious contaminants of cell culture and can have profound effects on host cell biology by depriving cells of nutrients and inducing global changes in gene expression. Over the last two decades, sentinel testing has revealed wide-ranging contamination rates in mammalian culture. To obtain an unbiased assessment from hundreds of labs, we analyzed sequence data from 9395 rodent and primate samples from 884 series in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive. We found 11% of these series were contaminated (defined as >/=100 reads/million mapping to mycoplasma in one or more samples). Ninety percent of mycoplasma-mapped reads aligned to ribosomal RNA. This was unexpected given 37% of contaminated series used poly(A)-selection for mRNA enrichment. Lastly, we examined the relationship between mycoplasma contamination and host gene expression in a single cell RNA-seq dataset and found 61 host genes (P < 0.001) were significantly associated with mycoplasma-mapped read counts. In all, this study suggests mycoplasma contamination is still prevalent today and poses substantial risk to research quality.
38429430	2024	Nature biotechnology	Characterizing the impacts of dataset imbalance on single-cell data integration.	Computational methods for integrating single-cell transcriptomic data from multiple samples and conditions do not generally account for imbalances in the cell types measured in different datasets. In this study, we examined how differences in the cell types present, the number of cells per cell type and the cell type proportions across samples affect downstream analyses after integration. The Iniquitate pipeline assesses the robustness of integration results after perturbing the degree of imbalance between datasets. Benchmarking of five state-of-the-art single-cell RNA sequencing integration techniques in 2,600 integration experiments indicates that sample imbalance has substantial impacts on downstream analyses and the biological interpretation of integration results. Imbalance perturbation led to statistically significant variation in unsupervised clustering, cell type classification, differential expression and marker gene annotation, query-to-reference mapping and trajectory inference. We quantified the impacts of imbalance through newly introduced properties-aggregate cell type support and minimum cell type center distance. To better characterize and mitigate impacts of imbalance, we introduce balanced clustering metrics and imbalanced integration guidelines for integration method users.
38300515	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	scMMT: a multi-use deep learning approach for cell annotation, protein prediction and embedding in single-cell RNA-seq data.	Accurate cell type annotation in single-cell RNA-sequencing data is essential for advancing biological and medical research, particularly in understanding disease progression and tumor microenvironments. However, existing methods are constrained by single feature extraction approaches, lack of adaptability to immune cell types with similar molecular profiles but distinct functions and a failure to account for the impact of cell label noise on model accuracy, all of which compromise the precision of annotation. To address these challenges, we developed a supervised approach called scMMT. We proposed a novel feature extraction technique to uncover more valuable information. Additionally, we constructed a multi-task learning framework based on the GradNorm method to enhance the recognition of challenging immune cells and reduce the impact of label noise by facilitating mutual reinforcement between cell type annotation and protein prediction tasks. Furthermore, we introduced logarithmic weighting and label smoothing mechanisms to enhance the recognition ability of rare cell types and prevent model overconfidence. Through comprehensive evaluations on multiple public datasets, scMMT has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in various aspects including cell type annotation, rare cell identification, dropout and label noise resistance, protein expression prediction and low-dimensional embedding representation.
39543284	2025	Nature methods	Deep learning-based models for preimplantation mouse and human embryos based on single-cell RNA sequencing.	The rapid growth of single-cell transcriptomic technology has produced an increasing number of datasets for both embryonic development and in vitro pluripotent stem cell-derived models. This avalanche of data surrounding pluripotency and the process of lineage specification has meant it has become increasingly difficult to define specific cell types or states in vivo, and compare these with in vitro differentiation. Here we utilize a set of deep learning tools to integrate and classify multiple datasets. This allows the definition of both mouse and human embryo cell types, lineages and states, thereby maximizing the information one can garner from these precious experimental resources. Our approaches are built on recent initiatives for large-scale human organ atlases, but here we focus on material that is difficult to obtain and process, spanning early mouse and human development. Using publicly available data for these stages, we test different deep learning approaches and develop a model to classify cell types in an unbiased fashion at the same time as defining the set of genes used by the model to identify lineages, cell types and states. We used our models trained on in vivo development to classify pluripotent stem cell models for both mouse and human development, showcasing the importance of this resource as a dynamic reference for early embryogenesis.
33316046	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	Goals and approaches for each processing step for single-cell RNA sequencing data.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has enabled researchers to study gene expression at the cellular level. However, due to the extremely low levels of transcripts in a single cell and technical losses during reverse transcription, gene expression at a single-cell resolution is usually noisy and highly dimensional; thus, statistical analyses of single-cell data are a challenge. Although many scRNA-seq data analysis tools are currently available, a gold standard pipeline is not available for all datasets. Therefore, a general understanding of bioinformatics and associated computational issues would facilitate the selection of appropriate tools for a given set of data. In this review, we provide an overview of the goals and most popular computational analysis tools for the quality control, normalization, imputation, feature selection and dimension reduction of scRNA-seq data.
30649203	2019	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	ClusterMap: compare multiple single cell RNA-Seq datasets across different experimental conditions.	MOTIVATION: Single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) facilitates the characterization of cell type heterogeneity and developmental processes. Further study of single cell profiles across different conditions enables the understanding of biological processes and underlying mechanisms at the sub-population level. However, developing proper methodology to compare multiple scRNA-Seq datasets remains challenging. RESULTS: We have developed ClusterMap, a systematic method and workflow to facilitate the comparison of scRNA-seq profiles across distinct biological contexts. Using hierarchical clustering of the marker genes of each sub-group, ClusterMap matches the sub-types of cells across different samples and provides 'similarity' as a metric to quantify the quality of the match. We introduce a purity tree cut method designed specifically for this matching problem. We use Circos plot and regrouping method to visualize the results concisely. Furthermore, we propose a new metric 'separability' to summarize sub-population changes among all sample pairs. In the case studies, we demonstrate that ClusterMap has the ability to provide us further insight into the different molecular mechanisms of cellular sub-populations across different conditions. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: ClusterMap is implemented in R and available at https://github.com/xgaoo/ClusterMap. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

33122305	2020	Genome research	Identification of bona fide B2 SINE retrotransposon transcription through single-nucleus RNA-seq of the mouse hippocampus.	Currently, researchers rely on generalized methods to quantify transposable element (TE) RNA expression, such as RT-qPCR and RNA-seq, that do not distinguish between TEs expressed from their own promoter (bona fide) and TEs that are transcribed from a neighboring gene promoter such as within an intron or exon. This distinction is important owing to the differing functional roles of TEs depending on whether they are independently transcribed. Here we report a simple strategy to examine bona fide TE expression, termed BonaFide-TEseq. This approach can be used with any template-switch based library such as Smart-seq2 or the single-cell 5' gene expression kit from 10x, extending its utility to single-cell RNA-sequencing. This approach does not require TE-specific enrichment, enabling the simultaneous examination of TEs and protein-coding genes. We show that TEs identified through BonaFide-TEseq are expressed from their own promoter, rather than captured as internal products of genes. We reveal the utility of BonaFide-TEseq in the analysis of single-cell data and show that short-interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) show cell type-specific expression profiles in the mouse hippocampus. We further show that, in response to a brief exposure of home-cage mice to a novel stimulus, SINEs are activated in dentate granule neurons in a time course that is similar to that of protein-coding immediate early genes. This work provides a simple alternative approach to assess bona fide TE transcription at single-cell resolution and provides a proof-of-concept using this method to identify SINE activation in a context that is relevant for normal learning and memory.
38570851	2024	Genome biology	Merit of integrating in situ transcriptomics and anatomical information for cell annotation and lineage construction in single-cell analyses of Populus.	Cell type annotation and lineage construction are two of the most critical tasks conducted in the analyses of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Four recent scRNA-seq studies of differentiating xylem propose four models on differentiating xylem development in Populus. The differences are mostly caused by the use of different strategies for cell type annotation and subsequent lineage interpretation. Here, we emphasize the necessity of using in situ transcriptomes and anatomical information to construct the most plausible xylem development model.
38871986	2024	Nature methods	CellRank 2: unified fate mapping in multiview single-cell data.	Single-cell RNA sequencing allows us to model cellular state dynamics and fate decisions using expression similarity or RNA velocity to reconstruct state-change trajectories; however, trajectory inference does not incorporate valuable time point information or utilize additional modalities, whereas methods that address these different data views cannot be combined or do not scale. Here we present CellRank 2, a versatile and scalable framework to study cellular fate using multiview single-cell data of up to millions of cells in a unified fashion. CellRank 2 consistently recovers terminal states and fate probabilities across data modalities in human hematopoiesis and endodermal development. Our framework also allows combining transitions within and across experimental time points, a feature we use to recover genes promoting medullary thymic epithelial cell formation during pharyngeal endoderm development. Moreover, we enable estimating cell-specific transcription and degradation rates from metabolic-labeling data, which we apply to an intestinal organoid system to delineate differentiation trajectories and pinpoint regulatory strategies.
36528803	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Improving the performance of single-cell RNA-seq data mining based on relative expression orderings.	The advent of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides an unprecedented opportunity to explore gene expression profiles at the single-cell level. However, gene expression values vary over time and under different conditions even within the same cell. There is an urgent need for more stable and reliable feature variables at the single-cell level to depict cell heterogeneity. Thus, we construct a new feature matrix called the delta rank matrix (DRM) from scRNA-seq data by integrating an a priori gene interaction network, which transforms the unreliable gene expression value into a stable gene interaction/edge value on a single-cell basis. This is the first time that a gene-level feature has been transformed into an interaction/edge-level for scRNA-seq data analysis based on relative expression orderings. Experiments on various scRNA-seq datasets have demonstrated that DRM performs better than the original gene expression matrix in cell clustering, cell identification and pseudo-trajectory reconstruction. More importantly, the DRM really achieves the fusion of gene expressions and gene interactions and provides a method of measuring gene interactions at the single-cell level. Thus, the DRM can be used to find changes in gene interactions among different cell types, which may open up a new way to analyze scRNA-seq data from an interaction perspective. In addition, DRM provides a new method to construct a cell-specific network for each single cell instead of a group of cells as in traditional network construction methods. DRM's exceptional performance is due to its extraction of rich gene-association information on biological systems and stable characterization of cells.
38553769	2024	Genome biology	FixNCut: single-cell genomics through reversible tissue fixation and dissociation.	The use of single-cell technologies for clinical applications requires disconnecting sampling from downstream processing steps. Early sample preservation can further increase robustness and reproducibility by avoiding artifacts introduced during specimen handling. We present FixNCut, a methodology for the reversible fixation of tissue followed by dissociation that overcomes current limitations. We applied FixNCut to human and mouse tissues to demonstrate the preservation of RNA integrity, sequencing library complexity, and cellular composition, while diminishing stress-related artifacts. Besides single-cell RNA sequencing, FixNCut is compatible with multiple single-cell and spatial technologies, making it a versatile tool for robust and flexible study designs.

SUMMARY: Power analysis is essential to optimize the design of RNA-seq experiments and to assess and compare the power to detect differentially expressed genes in RNA-seq data. PowsimR is a flexible tool to simulate and evaluate differential expression from bulk and especially single-cell RNA-seq data making it suitable for a priori and posterior power analyses.

33201180	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	Are dropout imputation methods for scRNA-seq effective for scHi-C data?	The prevalence of dropout events is a serious problem for single-cell Hi-C (scHiC) data due to insufficient sequencing depth and data coverage, which brings difficulties in downstream studies such as clustering and structural analysis. Complicating things further is the fact that dropouts are confounded with structural zeros due to underlying properties, leading to observed zeros being a mixture of both types of events. Although a great deal of progress has been made in imputing dropout events for single cell RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data, little has been done in identifying structural zeros and imputing dropouts for scHiC data. In this paper, we adapted several methods from the single-cell RNA-seq literature for inference on observed zeros in scHiC data and evaluated their effectiveness. Through an extensive simulation study and real data analysis, we have shown that a couple of the adapted single-cell RNA-seq algorithms can be powerful for correctly identifying structural zeros and accurately imputing dropout values. Downstream analysis using the imputed values showed considerable improvement for clustering cells of the same types together over clustering results before imputation.
37146053	2023	PLoS computational biology	Matrix prior for data transfer between single cell data types in latent Dirichlet allocation.	"Single cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) enables the mapping of regulatory elements in fine-grained cell types. Despite this advance, analysis of the resulting data is challenging, and large scale scATAC-seq data are difficult to obtain and expensive to generate. This motivates a method to leverage information from previously generated large scale scATAC-seq or scRNA-seq data to guide our analysis of new scATAC-seq datasets. We analyze scATAC-seq data using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a Bayesian algorithm that was developed to model text corpora, summarizing documents as mixtures of topics defined based on the words that distinguish the documents. When applied to scATAC-seq, LDA treats cells as documents and their accessible sites as words, identifying ""topics"" based on the cell type-specific accessible sites in those cells. Previous work used uniform symmetric priors in LDA, but we hypothesized that nonuniform matrix priors generated from LDA models trained on existing data sets may enable improved detection of cell types in new data sets, especially if they have relatively few cells. In this work, we test this hypothesis in scATAC-seq data from whole C. elegans nematodes and SHARE-seq data from mouse skin cells. We show that nonsymmetric matrix priors for LDA improve our ability to capture cell type information from small scATAC-seq datasets."
36170235	2022	PLoS computational biology	Towards reliable quantification of cell state velocities.	A few years ago, it was proposed to use the simultaneous quantification of unspliced and spliced messenger RNA (mRNA) to add a temporal dimension to high-throughput snapshots of single cell RNA sequencing data. This concept can yield additional insight into the transcriptional dynamics of the biological systems under study. However, current methods for inferring cell state velocities from such data (known as RNA velocities) are afflicted by several theoretical and computational problems, hindering realistic and reliable velocity estimation. We discuss these issues and propose new solutions for addressing some of the current challenges in consistency of data processing, velocity inference and visualisation. We translate our computational conclusion in two velocity analysis tools: one detailed method kappa-velo and one heuristic method eco-velo, each of which uses a different set of assumptions about the data.
37170676	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	P-CSN: single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis by partial cell-specific network.	Although many single-cell computational methods proposed use gene expression as input, recent studies show that replacing 'unstable' gene expression with 'stable' gene-gene associations can greatly improve the performance of downstream analysis. To obtain accurate gene-gene associations, conditional cell-specific network method (c-CSN) filters out the indirect associations of cell-specific network method (CSN) based on the conditional independence of statistics. However, when there are strong connections in networks, the c-CSN suffers from false negative problem in network construction. To overcome this problem, a new partial cell-specific network method (p-CSN) based on the partial independence of statistics is proposed in this paper, which eliminates the singularity of the c-CSN by implicitly including direct associations among estimated variables. Based on the p-CSN, single-cell network entropy (scNEntropy) is further proposed to quantify cell state. The superiorities of our method are verified on several datasets. (i) Compared with traditional gene regulatory network construction methods, the p-CSN constructs partial cell-specific networks, namely, one cell to one network. (ii) When there are strong connections in networks, the p-CSN reduces the false negative probability of the c-CSN. (iii) The input of more accurate gene-gene associations further optimizes the performance of downstream analyses. (iv) The scNEntropy effectively quantifies cell state and reconstructs cell pseudo-time.
36548380	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	SCIBER: a simple method for removing batch effects from single-cell RNA-sequencing data.	MOTIVATION: Integrative analysis of multiple single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets allows for more comprehensive characterizations of cell types, but systematic technical differences between datasets, known as 'batch effects', need to be removed before integration to avoid misleading interpretation of the data. Although many batch-effect-removal methods have been developed, there is still a large room for improvement: most existing methods only give dimension-reduced data instead of expression data of individual genes, are based on computationally demanding models and are black-box models and thus difficult to interpret or tune. RESULTS: Here, we present a new batch-effect-removal method called SCIBER (Single-Cell Integrator and Batch Effect Remover) and study its performance on real datasets. SCIBER matches cell clusters across batches according to the overlap of their differentially expressed genes. As a simple algorithm that has better scalability to data with a large number of cells and is easy to tune, SCIBER shows comparable and sometimes better accuracy in removing batch effects on real datasets compared to the state-of-the-art methods, which are much more complicated. Moreover, SCIBER outputs expression data in the original space, that is, the expression of individual genes, which can be used directly for downstream analyses. Additionally, SCIBER is a reference-based method, which assigns one of the batches as the reference batch and keeps it untouched during the process, making it especially suitable for integrating user-generated datasets with standard reference data such as the Human Cell Atlas. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: SCIBER is publicly available as an R package on CRAN: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SCIBER/. A vignette is included in the CRAN R package. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
30873540	2019	Nucleic acids research	Single-cell transcriptome analysis of Physcomitrella leaf cells during reprogramming using microcapillary manipulation.	Next-generation sequencing technologies have made it possible to carry out transcriptome analysis at the single-cell level. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data provide insights into cellular dynamics, including intercellular heterogeneity as well as inter- and intra-cellular fluctuations in gene expression that cannot be studied using populations of cells. The utilization of scRNA-seq is, however, restricted to cell types that can be isolated from their original tissues, and it can be difficult to obtain precise positional information for these cells in situ. Here, we established single cell-digital gene expression (1cell-DGE), a method of scRNA-seq that uses micromanipulation to extract the contents of individual living cells in intact tissue while recording their positional information. With 1cell-DGE, we could detect differentially expressed genes (DEGs) during the reprogramming of leaf cells of the moss Physcomitrella patens, identifying 6382 DEGs between cells at 0 and 24 h after excision. Furthermore, we identified a subpopulation of reprogramming cells based on their pseudotimes, which were calculated using transcriptome profiles at 24 h. 1cell-DGE with microcapillary manipulation can be used to analyze the gene expression of individual cells without detaching them from their tightly associated tissues, enabling us to retain positional information and investigate cell-cell interactions.
40333631	2025	PLoS computational biology	scSDNE: A semi-supervised method for inferring cell-cell interactions based on graph embedding.	As a fundamental characteristic of multicellular organisms, cell-cell communication is achieved through ligand-receptor (L-R) interactions, enabling the exchange of information and revealing the diversity of biological processes and cellular functions. To gain a comprehensive understanding of these complex interaction mechanisms, we constructed a manually curated L-R interaction database and developed a semi-supervised graph embedding model called scSDNE for inferring cell-cell interactions mediated by L-R interactions. scSDNE model utilizes the power of deep learning to map genes from interacting cells into a shared latent space, allowing for a nuanced representation of their relationships. Leveraging the prior information provided by database, scSDNE can infer significant L-R pairs involved in intercellular communication. Experiments on real single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets demonstrate that our method detects interactions with a high degree of reliability compared with other methods. More importantly, the model integrates gene regulation information within cells to enhance the accuracy and biological interpretability of the inferences. Our method provides a more comprehensive view of cell-cell interactions, offering new insights into complex intercellular communication.
39432561	2024	PLoS computational biology	scCaT: An explainable capsulating architecture for sepsis diagnosis transferring from single-cell RNA sequencing.	Sepsis is a life-threatening condition characterized by an exaggerated immune response to pathogens, leading to organ damage and high mortality rates in the intensive care unit. Although deep learning has achieved impressive performance on prediction and classification tasks in medicine, it requires large amounts of data and lacks explainability, which hinder its application to sepsis diagnosis. We introduce a deep learning framework, called scCaT, which blends the capsulating architecture with Transformer to develop a sepsis diagnostic model using single-cell RNA sequencing data and transfers it to bulk RNA data. The capsulating architecture effectively groups genes into capsules based on biological functions, which provides explainability in encoding gene expressions. The Transformer serves as a decoder to classify sepsis patients and controls. Our model achieves high accuracy with an AUROC of 0.93 on the single-cell test set and an average AUROC of 0.98 on seven bulk RNA cohorts. Additionally, the capsules can recognize different cell types and distinguish sepsis from control samples based on their biological pathways. This study presents a novel approach for learning gene modules and transferring the model to other data types, offering potential benefits in diagnosing rare diseases with limited subjects.
34648021	2022	Nucleic acids research	scMRMA: single cell multiresolution marker-based annotation.	Single-cell RNA sequencing has become a powerful tool for identifying and characterizing cellular heterogeneity. One essential step to understanding cellular heterogeneity is determining cell identities. The widely used strategy predicts identities by projecting cells or cell clusters unidirectionally against a reference to find the best match. Here, we develop a bidirectional method, scMRMA, where a hierarchical reference guides iterative clustering and deep annotation with enhanced resolutions. Taking full advantage of the reference, scMRMA greatly improves the annotation accuracy. scMRMA achieved better performance than existing methods in four benchmark datasets and successfully revealed the expansion of CD8 T cell populations in squamous cell carcinoma after anti-PD-1 treatment.
31932730	2020	Nature biotechnology	Integrating microarray-based spatial transcriptomics and single-cell RNA-seq reveals tissue architecture in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables the systematic identification of cell populations in a tissue, but characterizing their spatial organization remains challenging. We combine a microarray-based spatial transcriptomics method that reveals spatial patterns of gene expression using an array of spots, each capturing the transcriptomes of multiple adjacent cells, with scRNA-Seq generated from the same sample. To annotate the precise cellular composition of distinct tissue regions, we introduce a method for multimodal intersection analysis. Applying multimodal intersection analysis to primary pancreatic tumors, we find that subpopulations of ductal cells, macrophages, dendritic cells and cancer cells have spatially restricted enrichments, as well as distinct coenrichments with other cell types. Furthermore, we identify colocalization of inflammatory fibroblasts and cancer cells expressing a stress-response gene module. Our approach for mapping the architecture of scRNA-seq-defined subpopulations can be applied to reveal the interactions inherent to complex tissues.
29361178	2018	Nucleic acids research	dropClust: efficient clustering of ultra-large scRNA-seq data.	Droplet based single cell transcriptomics has recently enabled parallel screening of tens of thousands of single cells. Clustering methods that scale for such high dimensional data without compromising accuracy are scarce. We exploit Locality Sensitive Hashing, an approximate nearest neighbour search technique to develop a de novo clustering algorithm for large-scale single cell data. On a number of real datasets, dropClust outperformed the existing best practice methods in terms of execution time, clustering accuracy and detectability of minor cell sub-types.
40598893	2025	Nucleic acids research	Elucidating brain transport pathways and cell type-dependent gene silencing of a durable lipid-siRNA conjugate administered into cerebrospinal fluid.	The clinical neurosciences are in the midst of a renaissance spurred by the development of new therapeutic modalities. Short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), in particular, are gaining interest for treating neurological diseases owing to their capacity to sustain inhibition of nearly any gene target. However, to be effective, siRNA therapies must achieve delivery and on-target gene silencing activity in specific sites and cells in the brain. To this end, we developed a lipid-siRNA conjugate (L2-siRNA) that transports effectively throughout the brain when injected into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We provide a detailed examination of regional bulk tissue gene silencing in mice, highlighting potent knockdown 5 months after a single injection without detectable toxicity. Intrathecal delivery of L2-siRNA in rats further illustrates effective transport and knockdown using a clinically relevant route of administration. Single-cell RNA sequencing was additionally performed in mice to generate an atlas of cell type-specific knockdown. Lastly, we benchmarked L2-siRNA gene silencing activity in different brain regions against antisense oligonucleotides, a related but different gene silencing modality. Collectively, this work examines properties of lipid-siRNA conjugates that facilitate CSF to brain delivery and supports L2-siRNA as a promising platform for silencing genes implicated in central nervous system disorders.
29432517	2018	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Spectral clustering based on learning similarity matrix.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology can generate genome-wide expression data at the single-cell levels. One important objective in scRNA-seq analysis is to cluster cells where each cluster consists of cells belonging to the same cell type based on gene expression patterns. RESULTS: We introduce a novel spectral clustering framework that imposes sparse structures on a target matrix. Specifically, we utilize multiple doubly stochastic similarity matrices to learn a similarity matrix, motivated by the observation that each similarity matrix can be a different informative representation of the data. We impose a sparse structure on the target matrix followed by shrinking pairwise differences of the rows in the target matrix, motivated by the fact that the target matrix should have these structures in the ideal case. We solve the proposed non-convex problem iteratively using the ADMM algorithm and show the convergence of the algorithm. We evaluate the performance of the proposed clustering method on various simulated as well as real scRNA-seq data, and show that it can identify clusters accurately and robustly. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The algorithm is implemented in MATLAB. The source code can be downloaded at https://github.com/ishspsy/project/tree/master/MPSSC. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
35272348	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	LRcell: detecting the source of differential expression at the sub-cell-type level from bulk RNA-seq data.	Given most tissues are consist of abundant and diverse (sub-)cell types, an important yet unaddressed problem in bulk RNA-seq analysis is to identify at which (sub-)cell type(s) the differential expression occurs. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies can answer the question, but they are often labor-intensive and cost-prohibitive. Here, we present LRcell, a computational method aiming to identify specific (sub-)cell type(s) that drives the changes observed in a bulk RNA-seq experiment. In addition, LRcell provides pre-embedded marker genes computed from putative scRNA-seq experiments as options to execute the analyses. We conduct a simulation study to demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of LRcell. Using three different real datasets, we show that LRcell successfully identifies known cell types involved in psychiatric disorders. Applying LRcell to bulk RNA-seq results can produce a hypothesis on which (sub-)cell type(s) contributes to the differential expression. LRcell is complementary to cell type deconvolution methods.
32907628	2020	Genome biology	Natural display of nuclear-encoded RNA on the cell surface and its impact on cell interaction.	BACKGROUND: Compared to proteins, glycans, and lipids, much less is known about RNAs on the cell surface. We develop a series of technologies to test for any nuclear-encoded RNAs that are stably attached to the cell surface and exposed to the extracellular space, hereafter called membrane-associated extracellular RNAs (maxRNAs). RESULTS: We develop a technique called Surface-seq to selectively sequence maxRNAs and validate two Surface-seq identified maxRNAs by RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization. To test for cell-type specificity of maxRNA, we use antisense oligos to hybridize to single-stranded transcripts exposed on the surface of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Combining this strategy with imaging flow cytometry, single-cell RNA sequencing, and maxRNA sequencing, we identify monocytes as the major type of maxRNA+ PBMCs and prioritize 11 candidate maxRNAs for functional tests. Extracellular application of antisense oligos of FNDC3B and CTSS transcripts inhibits monocyte adhesion to vascular endothelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these data highlight maxRNAs as functional components of the cell surface, suggesting an expanded role for RNA in cell-cell and cell-environment interactions.
41044600	2025	Genome biology	GWAS-informed data integration and non-coding CRISPRi screen illuminate genetic etiology of bone mineral density.	BACKGROUND: Over 1100 independent signals have been identified with genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for bone mineral density (BMD), a key risk factor for mortality-increasing fragility fractures; however, the effector gene(s) for most remain unknown. RESULTS: We execute a CRISPRi screen in human fetal osteoblasts (hFOBs) with single-cell RNA-seq read-out for 89 non-coding elements predicted to regulate osteoblast gene expression at BMD GWAS loci. The BMD relevance of hFOBs is supported by heritability enrichment from stratified LD-score regression involving 98 cell types grouped into 15 tissues. Twenty-three genes show perturbation in the screen, with four (ARID5B, CC2D1B, EIF4G2, and NCOA3) exhibiting consistent effects upon siRNA knockdown on three measures of osteoblast maturation and mineralization. Lastly, additional heritability enrichments, genetic correlations, and multi-trait fine-mapping unexpectedly reveal that many BMD GWAS signals are pleiotropic and likely mediate their effects via non-bone tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide a roadmap for how single-cell CRISPRi screens may be applied to the challenging task of resolving effector gene identities at all BMD GWAS loci. Extending our CRISPRi screening approach to other tissues could play a key role in fully elucidating the etiology of BMD.
36825817	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scGCL: an imputation method for scRNA-seq data based on graph contrastive learning.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is widely used to reveal cellular heterogeneity, complex disease mechanisms and cell differentiation processes. Due to high sparsity and complex gene expression patterns, scRNA-seq data present a large number of dropout events, affecting downstream tasks such as cell clustering and pseudo-time analysis. Restoring the expression levels of genes is essential for reducing technical noise and facilitating downstream analysis. However, existing scRNA-seq data imputation methods ignore the topological structure information of scRNA-seq data and cannot comprehensively utilize the relationships between cells. RESULTS: Here, we propose a single-cell Graph Contrastive Learning method for scRNA-seq data imputation, named scGCL, which integrates graph contrastive learning and Zero-inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) distribution to estimate dropout values. scGCL summarizes global and local semantic information through contrastive learning and selects positive samples to enhance the representation of target nodes. To capture the global probability distribution, scGCL introduces an autoencoder based on the ZINB distribution, which reconstructs the scRNA-seq data based on the prior distribution. Through extensive experiments, we verify that scGCL outperforms existing state-of-the-art imputation methods in clustering performance and gene imputation on 14 scRNA-seq datasets. Further, we find that scGCL can enhance the expression patterns of specific genes in Alzheimer's disease datasets. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The code and data of scGCL are available on Github: https://github.com/zehaoxiong123/scGCL. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

SUMMARY: We developed 2DImpute, an imputation method for correcting false zeros (known as dropouts) in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. It features preventing excessive correction by predicting the false zeros and imputing their values by making use of the interrelationships between both genes and cells in the expression matrix. We showed that 2DImpute outperforms several leading imputation methods by applying it on datasets from various scRNA-seq protocols. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The R package of 2DImpute is freely available at GitHub (https://github.com/zky0708/2DImpute). CONTACT: d.anastassiou@columbia.edu. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
31796933	2019	Nature biotechnology	Visualizing structure and transitions in high-dimensional biological data.	The high-dimensional data created by high-throughput technologies require visualization tools that reveal data structure and patterns in an intuitive form. We present PHATE, a visualization method that captures both local and global nonlinear structure using an information-geometric distance between data points. We compare PHATE to other tools on a variety of artificial and biological datasets, and find that it consistently preserves a range of patterns in data, including continual progressions, branches and clusters, better than other tools. We define a manifold preservation metric, which we call denoised embedding manifold preservation (DEMaP), and show that PHATE produces lower-dimensional embeddings that are quantitatively better denoised as compared to existing visualization methods. An analysis of a newly generated single-cell RNA sequencing dataset on human germ-layer differentiation demonstrates how PHATE reveals unique biological insight into the main developmental branches, including identification of three previously undescribed subpopulations. We also show that PHATE is applicable to a wide variety of data types, including mass cytometry, single-cell RNA sequencing, Hi-C and gut microbiome data.
33397454	2021	Genome biology	scMC learns biological variation through the alignment of multiple single-cell genomics datasets.	Distinguishing biological from technical variation is crucial when integrating and comparing single-cell genomics datasets across different experiments. Existing methods lack the capability in explicitly distinguishing these two variations, often leading to the removal of both variations. Here, we present an integration method scMC to remove the technical variation while preserving the intrinsic biological variation. scMC learns biological variation via variance analysis to subtract technical variation inferred in an unsupervised manner. Application of scMC to both simulated and real datasets from single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq experiments demonstrates its capability of detecting context-shared and context-specific biological signals via accurate alignment.
29939984	2018	PLoS computational biology	Exploring the single-cell RNA-seq analysis landscape with the scRNA-tools database.	As single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets have become more widespread the number of tools designed to analyse these data has dramatically increased. Navigating the vast sea of tools now available is becoming increasingly challenging for researchers. In order to better facilitate selection of appropriate analysis tools we have created the scRNA-tools database (www.scRNA-tools.org) to catalogue and curate analysis tools as they become available. Our database collects a range of information on each scRNA-seq analysis tool and categorises them according to the analysis tasks they perform. Exploration of this database gives insights into the areas of rapid development of analysis methods for scRNA-seq data. We see that many tools perform tasks specific to scRNA-seq analysis, particularly clustering and ordering of cells. We also find that the scRNA-seq community embraces an open-source and open-science approach, with most tools available under open-source licenses and preprints being extensively used as a means to describe methods. The scRNA-tools database provides a valuable resource for researchers embarking on scRNA-seq analysis and records the growth of the field over time.
37086439	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	ICAT: a novel algorithm to robustly identify cell states following perturbations in single-cell transcriptomes.	MOTIVATION: The detection of distinct cellular identities is central to the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiments. However, in perturbation experiments, current methods typically fail to correctly match cell states between conditions or erroneously remove population substructure. Here, we present the novel, unsupervised algorithm Identify Cell states Across Treatments (ICAT) that employs self-supervised feature weighting and control-guided clustering to accurately resolve cell states across heterogeneous conditions. RESULTS: Using simulated and real datasets, we show ICAT is superior in identifying and resolving cell states compared with current integration workflows. While requiring no a priori knowledge of extant cell states or discriminatory marker genes, ICAT is robust to low signal strength, high perturbation severity, and disparate cell type proportions. We empirically validate ICAT in a developmental model and find that only ICAT identifies a perturbation-unique cellular response. Taken together, our results demonstrate that ICAT offers a significant improvement in defining cellular responses to perturbation in scRNA-seq data.

41029754	2025	Genome biology	MOADE: a multimodal autoencoder for dissociating bulk multi-omics data.	In single cell biology, the complexity of tissues may hinder lineage cell mapping or tumor microenvironment decomposition, requiring digital dissociation of bulk tissues. Many deconvolution methods focus on transcriptomic assay, not easily applicable to other omics due to ambiguous cell markers and reference-to-target difference. Here, we present MOADE, a multimodal autoencoder pipeline linking multi-dimensional features to jointly predict personalized multi-omic profiles and cellular compositions, using pseudo-bulk data constructed by internal non-transcriptomic reference and external scRNA-seq data. MOADE is evaluated through rigorous simulation experiments and real multi-omic data from multiple tissue types, outperforming nine deconvolution pipelines with superior generalizability and fidelity.
39800877	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	TRIAGE: an R package for regulatory gene analysis.	Regulatory genes are critical determinants of cellular responses in development and disease, but standard RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis workflows, such as differential expression analysis, have significant limitations in revealing the regulatory basis of cell identity and function. To address this challenge, we present the TRIAGE R package, a toolkit specifically designed to analyze regulatory elements in both bulk and single-cell RNA-seq datasets. The package is built upon TRIAGE methods, which leverage consortium-level H3K27me3 data to enrich for cell-type-specific regulatory regions. It facilitates the construction of efficient and adaptable pipelines for transcriptomic data analysis and visualization, with a focus on revealing regulatory gene networks. We demonstrate the utility of the TRIAGE R package using three independent transcriptomic datasets, showcasing its integration into standard analysis workflows for examining regulatory mechanisms across diverse biological contexts. The TRIAGE R package is available on GitHub at https://github.com/palpant-comp/TRIAGE_R_Package.
40253692	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	SCANER: robust and sensitive identification of malignant cells from the scRNA-seq profiled tumor ecosystem.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has enabled the dissection of complex tumor ecosystems. Recognition of malignant cells as an essential step has a profound impact on downstream interpretation. However, most existing computational strategies are based on prior knowledge of canonical cell-type markers. We have developed a marker-free approach, the Seed-Cluster based Approach for NEoplastic cells Recognition (SCANER), to identify malignant cells based on significant gene expression variations caused by genomic instability. Upon analyzing different cancer types, SCANER achieved superior accuracy and robustness in identifying malignant cells, effectively addressing dropout events and tumor purity variations. Besides, SCANER can significantly detect copy number variations (CNVs) in malignant cells compared to nonmalignant cells, which is further confirmed through the paired whole exome sequencing data. In conclusion, SCANER has the potential to facilitate the biological exploration of the tumor ecosystem by accurately identifying malignant cells and it is applicable across various solid cancer types regardless of prior knowledge. SCANER is available at https://github.com/woolingxiang/SCANER.
35404970	2022	PLoS computational biology	DGCyTOF: Deep learning with graphic cluster visualization to predict cell types of single cell mass cytometry data.	Single-cell mass cytometry, also known as cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF) is a powerful high-throughput technology that allows analysis of up to 50 protein markers per cell for the quantification and classification of single cells. Traditional manual gating utilized to identify new cell populations has been inadequate, inefficient, unreliable, and difficult to use, and no algorithms to identify both calibration and new cell populations has been well established. A deep learning with graphic cluster (DGCyTOF) visualization is developed as a new integrated embedding visualization approach in identifying canonical and new cell types. The DGCyTOF combines deep-learning classification and hierarchical stable-clustering methods to sequentially build a tri-layer construct for known cell types and the identification of new cell types. First, deep classification learning is constructed to distinguish calibration cell populations from all cells by softmax classification assignment under a probability threshold, and graph embedding clustering is then used to identify new cell populations sequentially. In the middle of two-layer, cell labels are automatically adjusted between new and unknown cell populations via a feedback loop using an iteration calibration system to reduce the rate of error in the identification of cell types, and a 3-dimensional (3D) visualization platform is finally developed to display the cell clusters with all cell-population types annotated. Utilizing two benchmark CyTOF databases comprising up to 43 million cells, we compared accuracy and speed in the identification of cell types among DGCyTOF, DeepCyTOF, and other technologies including dimension reduction with clustering, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Factor Analysis (FA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Isometric Feature Mapping (Isomap), t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) with k-means clustering and Gaussian mixture clustering. We observed the DGCyTOF represents a robust complete learning system with high accuracy, speed and visualization by eight measurement criteria. The DGCyTOF displayed F-scores of 0.9921 for CyTOF1 and 0.9992 for CyTOF2 datasets, whereas those scores were only 0.507 and 0.529 for the t-SNE+k-means; 0.565 and 0.59, for UMAP+ k-means. Comparison of DGCyTOF with t-SNE and UMAP visualization in accuracy demonstrated its approximately 35% superiority in predicting cell types. In addition, observation of cell-population distribution was more intuitive in the 3D visualization in DGCyTOF than t-SNE and UMAP visualization. The DGCyTOF model can automatically assign known labels to single cells with high accuracy using deep-learning classification assembling with traditional graph-clustering and dimension-reduction strategies. Guided by a calibration system, the model seeks optimal accuracy balance among calibration cell populations and unknown cell types, yielding a complete and robust learning system that is highly accurate in the identification of cell populations compared to results using other methods in the analysis of single-cell CyTOF data. Application of the DGCyTOF method to identify cell populations could be extended to the analysis of single-cell RNASeq data and other omics data.
39120646	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	A comparison of scRNA-seq annotation methods based on experimentally labeled immune cell subtype dataset.	Cell-type annotation is a critical step in single-cell data analysis. With the development of numerous cell annotation methods, it is necessary to evaluate these methods to help researchers use them effectively. Reference datasets are essential for evaluation, but currently, the cell labels of reference datasets mainly come from computational methods, which may have computational biases and may not reflect the actual cell-type outcomes. This study first constructed an experimentally labeled immune cell-subtype single-cell dataset of the same batch and systematically evaluated 18 cell annotation methods. We assessed those methods under five scenarios, including intra-dataset validation, immune cell-subtype validation, unsupervised clustering, inter-dataset annotation, and unknown cell-type prediction. Accuracy and ARI were evaluation metrics. The results showed that SVM, scBERT, and scDeepSort were the best-performing supervised methods. Seurat was the best-performing unsupervised clustering method, but it couldn't fully fit the actual cell-type distribution. Our results indicated that experimentally labeled immune cell-subtype datasets revealed the deficiencies of unsupervised clustering methods and provided new dataset support for supervised methods.
39327063	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	nsDCC: dual-level contrastive clustering with nonuniform sampling for scRNA-seq data analysis.	"Dimensionality reduction and clustering are crucial tasks in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis, treated independently in the current process, hindering their mutual benefits. The latest methods jointly optimize these tasks through deep clustering. However, contrastive learning, with powerful representation capability, can bridge the gap that common deep clustering methods face, which requires pre-defined cluster centers. Therefore, a dual-level contrastive clustering method with nonuniform sampling (nsDCC) is proposed for scRNA-seq data analysis. Dual-level contrastive clustering, which combines instance-level contrast and cluster-level contrast, jointly optimizes dimensionality reduction and clustering. Multi-positive contrastive learning and unit matrix constraint are introduced in instance- and cluster-level contrast, respectively. Furthermore, the attention mechanism is introduced to capture inter-cellular information, which is beneficial for clustering. The nsDCC focuses on important samples at category boundaries and in minority categories by the proposed nearest boundary sparsest density weight assignment algorithm, making it capable of capturing comprehensive characteristics against imbalanced datasets. Experimental results show that nsDCC outperforms the six other state-of-the-art methods on both real and simulated scRNA-seq data, validating its performance on dimensionality reduction and clustering of scRNA-seq data, especially for imbalanced data. Simulation experiments demonstrate that nsDCC is insensitive to ""dropout events"" in scRNA-seq. Finally, cluster differential expressed gene analysis confirms the meaningfulness of results from nsDCC. In summary, nsDCC is a new way of analyzing and understanding scRNA-seq data."

MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA-seq makes possible the investigation of variability in gene expression among cells, and dependence of variation on cell type. Statistical inference methods for such analyses must be scalable, and ideally interpretable. RESULTS: We present an approach based on a modification of a recently published highly scalable variational autoencoder framework that provides interpretability without sacrificing much accuracy. We demonstrate that our approach enables identification of gene programs in massive datasets. Our strategy, namely the learning of factor models with the auto-encoding variational Bayes framework, is not domain specific and may be useful for other applications.

41116172	2025	Genome biology	Insights, opportunities, and challenges provided by large cell atlases.	The field of single-cell biology is growing rapidly, generating large amounts of data from a variety of species, disease conditions, tissues, and organs. Coordinated efforts such as CZI CELLxGENE, HuBMAP, Broad Institute Single Cell Portal, and DISCO allow researchers to access large volumes of curated datasets, including more than just scRNA-seq data. These resources have created an opportunity to build and expand the computational biology ecosystem to develop tools necessary for data reuse and for extracting novel biological insights.

37072791	2023	Genome biology	Identification of genetic variants that impact gene co-expression relationships using large-scale single-cell data.	BACKGROUND: Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies show how genetic variants affect downstream gene expression. Single-cell data allows reconstruction of personalized co-expression networks and therefore the identification of SNPs altering co-expression patterns (co-expression QTLs, co-eQTLs) and the affected upstream regulatory processes using a limited number of individuals. RESULTS: We conduct a co-eQTL meta-analysis across four scRNA-seq peripheral blood mononuclear cell datasets using a novel filtering strategy followed by a permutation-based multiple testing approach. Before the analysis, we evaluate the co-expression patterns required for co-eQTL identification using different external resources. We identify a robust set of cell-type-specific co-eQTLs for 72 independent SNPs affecting 946 gene pairs. These co-eQTLs are replicated in a large bulk cohort and provide novel insights into how disease-associated variants alter regulatory networks. One co-eQTL SNP, rs1131017, that is associated with several autoimmune diseases, affects the co-expression of RPS26 with other ribosomal genes. Interestingly, specifically in T cells, the SNP additionally affects co-expression of RPS26 and a group of genes associated with T cell activation and autoimmune disease. Among these genes, we identify enrichment for targets of five T-cell-activation-related transcription factors whose binding sites harbor rs1131017. This reveals a previously overlooked process and pinpoints potential regulators that could explain the association of rs1131017 with autoimmune diseases. CONCLUSION: Our co-eQTL results highlight the importance of studying context-specific gene regulation to understand the biological implications of genetic variation. With the expected growth of sc-eQTL datasets, our strategy and technical guidelines will facilitate future co-eQTL identification, further elucidating unknown disease mechanisms.
31647523	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	SINC: a scale-invariant deep-neural-network classifier for bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: Scaling by sequencing depth is usually the first step of analysis of bulk or single-cell RNA-seq data, but estimating sequencing depth accurately can be difficult, especially for single-cell data, risking the validity of downstream analysis. It is thus of interest to eliminate the use of sequencing depth and analyze the original count data directly. RESULTS: We call an analysis method 'scale-invariant' (SI) if it gives the same result under different estimates of sequencing depth and hence can use the original count data without scaling. For the problem of classifying samples into pre-specified classes, such as normal versus cancerous, we develop a deep-neural-network based SI classifier named scale-invariant deep neural-network classifier (SINC). On nine bulk and single-cell datasets, the classification accuracy of SINC is better than or competitive to the best of eight other classifiers. SINC is easier to use and more reliable on data where proper sequencing depth is hard to determine. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: This source code of SINC is available at https://www.nd.edu/ approximately jli9/SINC.zip. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
24363023	2014	Nature methods	Quantitative single-cell RNA-seq with unique molecular identifiers.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a powerful tool to reveal cellular heterogeneity, discover new cell types and characterize tumor microevolution. However, losses in cDNA synthesis and bias in cDNA amplification lead to severe quantitative errors. We show that molecular labels--random sequences that label individual molecules--can nearly eliminate amplification noise, and that microfluidic sample preparation and optimized reagents produce a fivefold improvement in mRNA capture efficiency.
29950006	2018	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Random forest based similarity learning for single cell RNA sequencing data.	MOTIVATION: Genome-wide transcriptome sequencing applied to single cells (scRNA-seq) is rapidly becoming an assay of choice across many fields of biological and biomedical research. Scientific objectives often revolve around discovery or characterization of types or sub-types of cells, and therefore, obtaining accurate cell-cell similarities from scRNA-seq data is a critical step in many studies. While rapid advances are being made in the development of tools for scRNA-seq data analysis, few approaches exist that explicitly address this task. Furthermore, abundance and type of noise present in scRNA-seq datasets suggest that application of generic methods, or of methods developed for bulk RNA-seq data, is likely suboptimal. RESULTS: Here, we present RAFSIL, a random forest based approach to learn cell-cell similarities from scRNA-seq data. RAFSIL implements a two-step procedure, where feature construction geared towards scRNA-seq data is followed by similarity learning. It is designed to be adaptable and expandable, and RAFSIL similarities can be used for typical exploratory data analysis tasks like dimension reduction, visualization and clustering. We show that our approach compares favorably with current methods across a diverse collection of datasets, and that it can be used to detect and highlight unwanted technical variation in scRNA-seq datasets in situations where other methods fail. Overall, RAFSIL implements a flexible approach yielding a useful tool that improves the analysis of scRNA-seq data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The RAFSIL R package is available at www.kostkalab.net/software.html. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
38580861	2025	Nature biotechnology	Gene trajectory inference for single-cell data by optimal transport metrics.	Single-cell RNA sequencing has been widely used to investigate cell state transitions and gene dynamics of biological processes. Current strategies to infer the sequential dynamics of genes in a process typically rely on constructing cell pseudotime through cell trajectory inference. However, the presence of concurrent gene processes in the same group of cells and technical noise can obscure the true progression of the processes studied. To address this challenge, we present GeneTrajectory, an approach that identifies trajectories of genes rather than trajectories of cells. Specifically, optimal transport distances are calculated between gene distributions across the cell-cell graph to extract gene programs and define their gene pseudotemporal order. Here we demonstrate that GeneTrajectory accurately extracts progressive gene dynamics in myeloid lineage maturation. Moreover, we show that GeneTrajectory deconvolves key gene programs underlying mouse skin hair follicle dermal condensate differentiation that could not be resolved by cell trajectory approaches. GeneTrajectory facilitates the discovery of gene programs that control the changes and activities of biological processes.
38980373	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	DeepGRNCS: deep learning-based framework for jointly inferring gene regulatory networks across cell subpopulations.	Inferring gene regulatory networks (GRNs) allows us to obtain a deeper understanding of cellular function and disease pathogenesis. Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology have improved the accuracy of GRN inference. However, many methods for inferring individual GRNs from scRNA-seq data are limited because they overlook intercellular heterogeneity and similarities between different cell subpopulations, which are often present in the data. Here, we propose a deep learning-based framework, DeepGRNCS, for jointly inferring GRNs across cell subpopulations. We follow the commonly accepted hypothesis that the expression of a target gene can be predicted based on the expression of transcription factors (TFs) due to underlying regulatory relationships. We initially processed scRNA-seq data by discretizing data scattering using the equal-width method. Then, we trained deep learning models to predict target gene expression from TFs. By individually removing each TF from the expression matrix, we used pre-trained deep model predictions to infer regulatory relationships between TFs and genes, thereby constructing the GRN. Our method outperforms existing GRN inference methods for various simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets. Finally, we applied DeepGRNCS to non-small cell lung cancer scRNA-seq data to identify key genes in each cell subpopulation and analyzed their biological relevance. In conclusion, DeepGRNCS effectively predicts cell subpopulation-specific GRNs. The source code is available at https://github.com/Nastume777/DeepGRNCS.
40568942	2025	Nucleic acids research	MEBOCOST maps metabolite-mediated intercellular communications using single-cell RNA-seq.	Cell-cell communication (CCC) is crucial for cellular function and tissue homeostasis. Existing methods for protein-oriented CCC detection often overlook metabolite-mediated CCC (mCCC), and adapting them to mCCC analysis is challenging due to fundamental differences in the underlying biological mechanisms. To fill this gap, we developed MEBOCOST, an algorithm built on scRNA-seq and metabolic flux balance analysis to detect mCCC among single cells. Comprehensive benchmarking analyses based on simulation, spatial, CRISPR screen, and clinical patient data demonstrated the robustness of MEBOCOST in detecting biologically significant mCCC events. We applied MEBOCOST to scRNA-seq datasets of human white adipose tissues and unraveled macrophages were the predominant source of mCCC reprogramming in obese patients. Moreover, analysis in mice brown adipose tissue successfully recapitulated known and further uncovered new mCCC events, including a glutamine-mediated endothelial-to-adipocyte communication, which was experimentally verified to regulate adipocyte differentiation. Therefore, MEBOCOST is a valuable tool for researchers investigating mCCC in diverse biological contexts and disease samples. MEBOCOST is freely available at https://github.com/kaifuchenlab/MEBOCOST.
40229908	2025	Genome biology	Extracellular vesicle-derived miRNA-mediated cell-cell communication inference for single-cell transcriptomic data with miRTalk.	MicroRNAs are released from cells in extracellular vesicles (EVs), representing an essential mode of cell-cell communication (CCC) via a regulatory effect on gene expression. Single-cell RNA-sequencing technologies have ushered in an era of elucidating CCC at single-cell resolution. Herein, we present miRTalk, a pioneering approach for inferring CCC mediated by EV-derived miRNA-target interactions (MiTIs). The benchmarking against simulated and real-world datasets demonstrates the superior performance of miRTalk, and the application to four disease scenarios reveals the in-depth MiTI-mediated CCC mechanisms. Collectively, miRTalk can infer EV-derived MiTI-mediated CCC with scRNA-seq data, providing new insights into the intercellular dynamics of biological processes.
35228707	2022	Nature biotechnology	Multiscale PHATE identifies multimodal signatures of COVID-19.	As the biomedical community produces datasets that are increasingly complex and high dimensional, there is a need for more sophisticated computational tools to extract biological insights. We present Multiscale PHATE, a method that sweeps through all levels of data granularity to learn abstracted biological features directly predictive of disease outcome. Built on a coarse-graining process called diffusion condensation, Multiscale PHATE learns a data topology that can be analyzed at coarse resolutions for high-level summarizations of data and at fine resolutions for detailed representations of subsets. We apply Multiscale PHATE to a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) dataset with 54 million cells from 168 hospitalized patients and find that patients who die show CD16(hi)CD66b(lo) neutrophil and IFN-gamma(+) granzyme B(+) Th17 cell responses. We also show that population groupings from Multiscale PHATE directly fed into a classifier predict disease outcome more accurately than naive featurizations of the data. Multiscale PHATE is broadly generalizable to different data types, including flow cytometry, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), single-cell sequencing assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (scATAC-seq), and clinical variables.
37584660	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scNCL: transferring labels from scRNA-seq to scATAC-seq data with neighborhood contrastive regularization.	MOTIVATION: scATAC-seq has enabled chromatin accessibility landscape profiling at the single-cell level, providing opportunities for determining cell-type-specific regulation codes. However, high dimension, extreme sparsity, and large scale of scATAC-seq data have posed great challenges to cell-type identification. Thus, there has been a growing interest in leveraging the well-annotated scRNA-seq data to help annotate scATAC-seq data. However, substantial computational obstacles remain to transfer information from scRNA-seq to scATAC-seq, especially for their heterogeneous features. RESULTS: We propose a new transfer learning method, scNCL, which utilizes prior knowledge and contrastive learning to tackle the problem of heterogeneous features. Briefly, scNCL transforms scATAC-seq features into gene activity matrix based on prior knowledge. Since feature transformation can cause information loss, scNCL introduces neighborhood contrastive learning to preserve the neighborhood structure of scATAC-seq cells in raw feature space. To learn transferable latent features, scNCL uses a feature projection loss and an alignment loss to harmonize embeddings between scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq. Experiments on various datasets demonstrated that scNCL not only realizes accurate and robust label transfer for common types, but also achieves reliable detection of novel types. scNCL is also computationally efficient and scalable to million-scale datasets. Moreover, we prove scNCL can help refine cell-type annotations in existing scATAC-seq atlases. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code and data used in this paper can be found in https://github.com/CSUBioGroup/scNCL-release.
39102821	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Cellular proliferation biases clonal lineage tracing and trajectory inference.	MOTIVATION: Lineage tracing and trajectory inference from single-cell RNA-sequencing data hold tremendous potential for uncovering the genetic programs driving development and disease. Single cell datasets are thought to provide an unbiased view on the diverse cellular architecture of tissues. Sampling bias, however, can skew single cell datasets away from the cellular composition they are meant to represent. RESULTS: We demonstrate a novel form of sampling bias, caused by a statistical phenomenon related to repeated sampling from a growing, heterogeneous population. Relative growth rates of cells influence the probability that they will be sampled in clones observed across multiple time points. We support our probabilistic derivations with a simulation study and an analysis of a real time-course of T-cell development. We find that this bias can impact fate probability predictions, and we explore how to develop trajectory inference methods which are robust to this bias. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Source code for the simulated datasets and to create the figures in this manuscript is freely available in python at https://github.com/rbonhamcarter/simulate-clones. A python implementation of the extension of the LineageOT method is freely available at https://github.com/rbonhamcarter/LineageOT/tree/multi-time-clones.
36526433	2023	Genome research	Cross-species cell-type assignment from single-cell RNA-seq data by a heterogeneous graph neural network.	Cross-species comparative analyses of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data allow us to explore, at single-cell resolution, the origins of the cellular diversity and evolutionary mechanisms that shape cellular form and function. Cell-type assignment is a crucial step to achieve that. However, the poorly annotated genome and limited known biomarkers hinder us from assigning cell identities for nonmodel species. Here, we design a heterogeneous graph neural network model, CAME, to learn aligned and interpretable cell and gene embeddings for cross-species cell-type assignment and gene module extraction from scRNA-seq data. CAME achieves significant improvements in cell-type characterization across distant species owing to the utilization of non-one-to-one homologous gene mapping ignored by early methods. Our large-scale benchmarking study shows that CAME significantly outperforms five classical methods in terms of cell-type assignment and model robustness to insufficiency and inconsistency of sequencing depths. CAME can transfer the major cell types and interneuron subtypes of human brains to mouse and discover shared cell-type-specific functions in homologous gene modules. CAME can align the trajectories of human and macaque spermatogenesis and reveal their conservative expression dynamics. In short, CAME can make accurate cross-species cell-type assignments even for nonmodel species and uncover shared and divergent characteristics between two species from scRNA-seq data.
33165513	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Evaluating single-cell cluster stability using the Jaccard similarity index.	MOTIVATION: One major goal of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) experiments is to identify novel cell types. With increasingly large scRNAseq datasets, unsupervised clustering methods can now produce detailed catalogues of transcriptionally distinct groups of cells in a sample. However, the interpretation of these clusters is challenging for both technical and biological reasons. Popular clustering algorithms are sensitive to parameter choices, and can produce different clustering solutions with even small changes in the number of principal components used, the k nearest neighbor and the resolution parameters, among others. RESULTS: Here, we present a set of tools to evaluate cluster stability by subsampling, which can guide parameter choice and aid in biological interpretation. The R package scclusteval and the accompanying Snakemake workflow implement all steps of the pipeline: subsampling the cells, repeating the clustering with Seurat and estimation of cluster stability using the Jaccard similarity index and providing rich visualizations.

38547401	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Clustering single-cell multi-omics data via graph regularized multi-view ensemble learning.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell clustering plays a crucial role in distinguishing between cell types, facilitating the analysis of cell heterogeneity mechanisms. While many existing clustering methods rely solely on gene expression data obtained from single-cell RNA sequencing techniques to identify cell clusters, the information contained in mono-omic data is often limited, leading to suboptimal clustering performance. The emergence of single-cell multi-omics sequencing technologies enables the integration of multiple omics data for identifying cell clusters, but how to integrate different omics data effectively remains challenging. In addition, designing a clustering method that performs well across various types of multi-omics data poses a persistent challenge due to the data's inherent characteristics. RESULTS: In this paper, we propose a graph-regularized multi-view ensemble clustering (GRMEC-SC) model for single-cell clustering. Our proposed approach can adaptively integrate multiple omics data and leverage insights from multiple base clustering results. We extensively evaluate our method on five multi-omics datasets through a series of rigorous experiments. The results of these experiments demonstrate that our GRMEC-SC model achieves competitive performance across diverse multi-omics datasets with varying characteristics. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Implementation of GRMEC-SC, along with examples, can be found on the GitHub repository: https://github.com/polarisChen/GRMEC-SC.
37952182	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	cellsig plug-in enhances CIBERSORTx signature selection for multidataset transcriptomes with sparse multilevel modelling.	MOTIVATION: The precise characterization of cell-type transcriptomes is pivotal to understanding cellular lineages, deconvolution of bulk transcriptomes, and clinical applications. Single-cell RNA sequencing resources like the Human Cell Atlas have revolutionised cell-type profiling. However, challenges persist due to data heterogeneity and discrepancies across different studies. One limitation of prevailing tools such as CIBERSORTx is their inability to address hierarchical data structures and handle nonoverlapping gene sets across samples, relying on filtering or imputation. RESULTS: Here, we present cellsig, a Bayesian sparse multilevel model designed to improve signature estimation by adjusting data for multilevel effects and modelling for gene-set sparsity. Our model is tailored to large-scale, heterogeneous pseudobulk and bulk RNA sequencing data collections with nonoverlapping gene sets. We tested the performances of cellsig on a novel curated Human Bulk Cell-type Catalogue, which harmonizes 1435 samples across 58 datasets. We show that cellsig significantly enhances cell-type marker gene ranking performance. This approach is valuable for cell-type signature selection, with implications for marker gene validation, single-cell annotation, and deconvolution benchmarks. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Codes and the interactive app are available at https://github.com/stemangiola/cellsig; and the database is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7582421.
39936571	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	ELLIPSIS: robust quantification of splicing in scRNA-seq.	MOTIVATION: Alternative splicing is a tightly regulated biological process, that due to its cell type specific behavior, calls for analysis at the single cell level. However, quantifying differential splicing in scRNA-seq is challenging due to low and uneven coverage. Hereto, we developed ELLIPSIS, a tool for robust quantification of splicing in scRNA-seq that leverages locally observed read coverage with conservation of flow and intra-cell type similarity properties. Additionally, it is also able to quantify splicing in novel splicing events, which is extremely important in cancer cells where lots of novel splicing events occur. RESULTS: Application of ELLIPSIS to simulated data proves that our method is able to robustly estimate Percent Spliced In values in simulated data, and allows to reliably detect differential splicing between cell types. Using ELLIPSIS on glioblastoma scRNA-seq data, we identified genes that are differentially spliced between cancer cells in the tumor core and infiltrating cancer cells found in peripheral tissue. These genes showed to play a role in a.o. cell migration and motility, cell projection organization, and neuron projection guidance. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: ELLIPSIS quantification tool: https://github.com/MarchalLab/ELLIPSIS.git.
31739806	2019	Genome biology	Assessment of computational methods for the analysis of single-cell ATAC-seq data.	BACKGROUND: Recent innovations in single-cell Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq) enable profiling of the epigenetic landscape of thousands of individual cells. scATAC-seq data analysis presents unique methodological challenges. scATAC-seq experiments sample DNA, which, due to low copy numbers (diploid in humans), lead to inherent data sparsity (1-10% of peaks detected per cell) compared to transcriptomic (scRNA-seq) data (10-45% of expressed genes detected per cell). Such challenges in data generation emphasize the need for informative features to assess cell heterogeneity at the chromatin level. RESULTS: We present a benchmarking framework that is applied to 10 computational methods for scATAC-seq on 13 synthetic and real datasets from different assays, profiling cell types from diverse tissues and organisms. Methods for processing and featurizing scATAC-seq data were compared by their ability to discriminate cell types when combined with common unsupervised clustering approaches. We rank evaluated methods and discuss computational challenges associated with scATAC-seq analysis including inherently sparse data, determination of features, peak calling, the effects of sequencing coverage and noise, and clustering performance. Running times and memory requirements are also discussed. CONCLUSIONS: This reference summary of scATAC-seq methods offers recommendations for best practices with consideration for both the non-expert user and the methods developer. Despite variation across methods and datasets, SnapATAC, Cusanovich2018, and cisTopic outperform other methods in separating cell populations of different coverages and noise levels in both synthetic and real datasets. Notably, SnapATAC is the only method able to analyze a large dataset (> 80,000 cells).
35030198	2022	PLoS computational biology	Data-driven modeling predicts gene regulatory network dynamics during the differentiation of multipotential hematopoietic progenitors.	Cellular differentiation during hematopoiesis is guided by gene regulatory networks (GRNs) comprising transcription factors (TFs) and the effectors of cytokine signaling. Based largely on analyses conducted at steady state, these GRNs are thought to be organized as a hierarchy of bistable switches, with antagonism between Gata1 and PU.1 driving red- and white-blood cell differentiation. Here, we utilize transient gene expression patterns to infer the genetic architecture-the type and strength of regulatory interconnections-and dynamics of a twelve-gene GRN including key TFs and cytokine receptors. We trained gene circuits, dynamical models that learn genetic architecture, on high temporal-resolution gene-expression data from the differentiation of an inducible cell line into erythrocytes and neutrophils. The model is able to predict the consequences of gene knockout, knockdown, and overexpression experiments and the inferred interconnections are largely consistent with prior empirical evidence. The inferred genetic architecture is densely interconnected rather than hierarchical, featuring extensive cross-antagonism between genes from alternative lineages and positive feedback from cytokine receptors. The analysis of the dynamics of gene regulation in the model reveals that PU.1 is one of the last genes to be upregulated in neutrophil conditions and that the upregulation of PU.1 and other neutrophil genes is driven by Cebpa and Gfi1 instead. This model inference is confirmed in an independent single-cell RNA-Seq dataset from mouse bone marrow in which Cebpa and Gfi1 expression precedes the neutrophil-specific upregulation of PU.1 during differentiation. These results demonstrate that full PU.1 upregulation during neutrophil development involves regulatory influences extrinsic to the Gata1-PU.1 bistable switch. Furthermore, although there is extensive cross-antagonism between erythroid and neutrophil genes, it does not have a hierarchical structure. More generally, we show that the combination of high-resolution time series data and data-driven dynamical modeling can uncover the dynamics and causality of developmental events that might otherwise be obscured.
36370105	2023	Nucleic acids research	The STRING database in 2023: protein-protein association networks and functional enrichment analyses for any sequenced genome of interest.	Much of the complexity within cells arises from functional and regulatory interactions among proteins. The core of these interactions is increasingly known, but novel interactions continue to be discovered, and the information remains scattered across different database resources, experimental modalities and levels of mechanistic detail. The STRING database (https://string-db.org/) systematically collects and integrates protein-protein interactions-both physical interactions as well as functional associations. The data originate from a number of sources: automated text mining of the scientific literature, computational interaction predictions from co-expression, conserved genomic context, databases of interaction experiments and known complexes/pathways from curated sources. All of these interactions are critically assessed, scored, and subsequently automatically transferred to less well-studied organisms using hierarchical orthology information. The data can be accessed via the website, but also programmatically and via bulk downloads. The most recent developments in STRING (version 12.0) are: (i) it is now possible to create, browse and analyze a full interaction network for any novel genome of interest, by submitting its complement of encoded proteins, (ii) the co-expression channel now uses variational auto-encoders to predict interactions, and it covers two new sources, single-cell RNA-seq and experimental proteomics data and (iii) the confidence in each experimentally derived interaction is now estimated based on the detection method used, and communicated to the user in the web-interface. Furthermore, STRING continues to enhance its facilities for functional enrichment analysis, which are now fully available also for user-submitted genomes.
32188700	2020	Genome research	Time course regulatory analysis based on paired expression and chromatin accessibility data.	A time course experiment is a widely used design in the study of cellular processes such as differentiation or response to stimuli. In this paper, we propose time course regulatory analysis (TimeReg) as a method for the analysis of gene regulatory networks based on paired gene expression and chromatin accessibility data from a time course. TimeReg can be used to prioritize regulatory elements, to extract core regulatory modules at each time point, to identify key regulators driving changes of the cellular state, and to causally connect the modules across different time points. We applied the method to analyze paired chromatin accessibility and gene expression data from a retinoic acid (RA)-induced mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) differentiation experiment. The analysis identified 57,048 novel regulatory elements regulating cerebellar development, synapse assembly, and hindbrain morphogenesis, which substantially extended our knowledge of cis-regulatory elements during differentiation. Using single-cell RNA-seq data, we showed that the core regulatory modules can reflect the properties of different subpopulations of cells. Finally, the driver regulators are shown to be important in clarifying the relations between modules across adjacent time points. As a second example, our method on Ascl1-induced direct reprogramming from fibroblast to neuron time course data identified Id1/2 as driver regulators of early stage of reprogramming.
33826608	2021	PLoS computational biology	Imputation of spatially-resolved transcriptomes by graph-regularized tensor completion.	High-throughput spatial-transcriptomics RNA sequencing (sptRNA-seq) based on in-situ capturing technologies has recently been developed to spatially resolve transcriptome-wide mRNA expressions mapped to the captured locations in a tissue sample. Due to the low RNA capture efficiency by in-situ capturing and the complication of tissue section preparation, sptRNA-seq data often only provides an incomplete profiling of the gene expressions over the spatial regions of the tissue. In this paper, we introduce a graph-regularized tensor completion model for imputing the missing mRNA expressions in sptRNA-seq data, namely FIST, Fast Imputation of Spatially-resolved transcriptomes by graph-regularized Tensor completion. We first model sptRNA-seq data as a 3-way sparse tensor in genes (p-mode) and the (x, y) spatial coordinates (x-mode and y-mode) of the observed gene expressions, and then consider the imputation of the unobserved entries or fibers as a tensor completion problem in Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD) form. To improve the imputation of highly sparse sptRNA-seq data, we also introduce a protein-protein interaction network to add prior knowledge of gene functions, and a spatial graph to capture the the spatial relations among the capture spots. The tensor completion model is then regularized by a Cartesian product graph of protein-protein interaction network and the spatial graph to capture the high-order relations in the tensor. In the experiments, FIST was tested on ten 10x Genomics Visium spatial transcriptomic datasets of different tissue sections with cross-validation among the known entries in the imputation. FIST significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art methods for single-cell RNAseq data imputation. We also demonstrate that both the spatial graph and PPI network play an important role in improving the imputation. In a case study, we further analyzed the gene clusters obtained from the imputed gene expressions to show that the imputations by FIST indeed capture the spatial characteristics in the gene expressions and reveal functions that are highly relevant to three different kinds of tissues in mouse kidney.
37944045	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Hidden Markov random field models for cell-type assignment of spatially resolved transcriptomics.	MOTIVATION: The recent development of spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) technologies has facilitated research on gene expression in the spatial context. Annotating cell types is one crucial step for downstream analysis. However, many existing algorithms use an unsupervised strategy to assign cell types for SRT data. They first conduct clustering analysis and then aggregate cluster-level expression based on the clustering results. This workflow fails to leverage the marker gene information efficiently. On the other hand, other cell annotation methods designed for single-cell RNA-seq data utilize the cell-type marker genes information but fail to use spatial information in SRT data. RESULTS: We introduce a statistical spatial transcriptomics cell assignment model, SPAN, to annotate clusters of cells or spots into known types in SRT data with prior knowledge of predefined marker genes and spatial information. The SPAN model annotates cells or spots from SRT data using predefined overexpressed marker genes and combines a mixture model with a hidden Markov random field to model the spatial dependency between neighboring spots. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SPAN against spatial and nonspatial clustering algorithms through extensive simulation and real data experiments. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: https://github.com/ChengZ352/SPAN.
32718323	2020	Genome biology	Bayesian model selection reveals biological origins of zero inflation in single-cell transcriptomics.	BACKGROUND: Single-cell RNA sequencing is a powerful tool for characterizing cellular heterogeneity in gene expression. However, high variability and a large number of zero counts present challenges for analysis and interpretation. There is substantial controversy over the origins and proper treatment of zeros and no consensus on whether zero-inflated count distributions are necessary or even useful. While some studies assume the existence of zero inflation due to technical artifacts and attempt to impute the missing information, other recent studies argue that there is no zero inflation in scRNA-seq data. RESULTS: We apply a Bayesian model selection approach to unambiguously demonstrate zero inflation in multiple biologically realistic scRNA-seq datasets. We show that the primary causes of zero inflation are not technical but rather biological in nature. We also demonstrate that parameter estimates from the zero-inflated negative binomial distribution are an unreliable indicator of zero inflation. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the existence of zero inflation in scRNA-seq counts, we recommend the generalized linear model with negative binomial count distribution, not zero-inflated, as a suitable reference model for scRNA-seq analysis.
36109685	2023	Nature biotechnology	Mostly natural sequencing-by-synthesis for scRNA-seq using Ultima sequencing.	Here we introduce a mostly natural sequencing-by-synthesis (mnSBS) method for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), adapted to the Ultima genomics platform, and systematically benchmark it against current scRNA-seq technology. mnSBS uses mostly natural, unmodified nucleotides and only a low fraction of fluorescently labeled nucleotides, which allows for high polymerase processivity and lower costs. We demonstrate successful application in four scRNA-seq case studies of different technical and biological types, including 5' and 3' scRNA-seq, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a single individual and in multiplex, as well as Perturb-Seq. Benchmarking shows that results from mnSBS-based scRNA-seq are very similar to those using Illumina sequencing, with minor differences in results related to the position of reads relative to annotated gene boundaries, owing to single-end reads of Ultima being closer to gene ends than reads from Illumina. The method is thus compatible with state-of-the-art scRNA-seq libraries independent of the sequencing technology. We expect mnSBS to be of particular utility for cost-effective large-scale scRNA-seq projects.
39672980	2025	Nature methods	iFlpMosaics enable the multispectral barcoding and high-throughput comparative analysis of mutant and wild-type cells.	To understand gene function, it is necessary to compare cells carrying the mutated target gene with normal cells. In most biomedical studies, the cells being compared are in different mutant and control animals and, therefore, do not experience the same epigenetic changes and tissue microenvironment. The experimental induction of genetic mosaics is essential to determine a gene cell-autonomous function and to model the etiology of diseases caused by somatic mutations. Current technologies used to induce genetic mosaics in mice lack either accuracy, throughput or barcoding diversity. Here we present the iFlpMosaics toolkit comprising a large set of new genetic tools and mouse lines that enable recombinase-dependent ratiometric induction and single-cell clonal tracking of multiple fluorescently labeled wild-type and Cre-mutant cells within the same time window and tissue microenvironment. The labeled cells can be profiled by multispectral imaging or by fluorescence-activated flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing. iFlpMosaics facilitate the induction and analysis of genetic mosaics in any quiescent or progenitor cell, and for any given single or combination of floxed genes, thus enabling a more accurate understanding of how induced genetic mutations affect the biology of single cells during tissue development, homeostasis and disease.
40856525	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	sCIN: a contrastive learning framework for single-cell multi-omics data integration.	The rapid advancement of single-cell omics technologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing and single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high throughput sequencing has transformed our understanding of cellular heterogeneity and regulatory mechanisms. However, integrating these data types remains challenging due to distributional discrepancies and distinct feature spaces. To address this, we present a novel single-cell Contrastive INtegration framework (sCIN) that integrates different omics modalities into a shared low-dimensional latent space. sCIN uses modality-specific encoders and contrastive learning to generate latent representations for each modality, aligning cells across modalities and removing technology-specific biases. The framework was designed to rigorously prevent data leakage between training and testing, and was extensively evaluated on three real-world paired datasets namely simultaneous high-throughput ATAC and RNA expression with sequencing, 10X PBMC (10k version), and cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes, and one unpaired dataset of gene expression and chromatin accessibility. Paired datasets refer to multi-omics data generated using technologies capable of capturing different omics features from the same cell population while unpaired datasets are measured from different cell populations from a tissue. Results on paired and unpaired datasets show that sCIN outperforms state-of-the-art models, including scGLUE, scBridge, sciCAN, Con-AAE, Harmony, and MOFA+, across multiple metrics: average silhouette width for clustering quality, Recall@k, cell type@k, cell type accuracy, and median rank for integration quality. Moreover, sCIN was evaluated on simulated unpaired datasets derived from paired data, demonstrating its ability to leverage available biological information for effective multimodal integration. In summary, sCIN reliably integrates omics modalities while preserving biological meaning in both paired and unpaired settings.
33715007	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	ExperimentSubset: an R package to manage subsets of Bioconductor Experiment objects.	MOTIVATION: R Experiment objects such as the SummarizedExperiment or SingleCellExperiment are data containers for storing one or more matrix-like assays along with associated row and column data. These objects have been used to facilitate the storage and analysis of high-throughput genomic data generated from technologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing. One common computational task in many genomics analysis workflows is to perform subsetting of the data matrix before applying down-stream analytical methods. For example, one may need to subset the columns of the assay matrix to exclude poor-quality samples or subset the rows of the matrix to select the most variable features. Traditionally, a second object is created that contains the desired subset of assay from the original object. However, this approach is inefficient as it requires the creation of an additional object containing a copy of the original assay and leads to challenges with data provenance. RESULTS: To overcome these challenges, we developed an R package called ExperimentSubset, which is a data container that implements classes for efficient storage and streamlined retrieval of assays that have been subsetted by rows and/or columns. These classes are able to inherently provide data provenance by maintaining the relationship between the subsetted and parent assays. We demonstrate the utility of this package on a single-cell RNA-seq dataset by storing and retrieving subsets at different stages of the analysis while maintaining a lower memory footprint. Overall, the ExperimentSubset is a flexible container for the efficient management of subsets. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: ExperimentSubset package is available at Bioconductor: https://bioconductor.org/packages/ExperimentSubset/ and Github: https://github.com/campbio/ExperimentSubset. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
32392348	2020	Nucleic acids research	Matrix factorization and transfer learning uncover regulatory biology across multiple single-cell ATAC-seq data sets.	While the methods available for single-cell ATAC-seq analysis are well optimized for clustering cell types, the question of how to integrate multiple scATAC-seq data sets and/or sequencing modalities is still open. We present an analysis framework that enables such integration across scATAC-seq data sets by applying the CoGAPS Matrix Factorization algorithm and the projectR transfer learning program to identify common regulatory patterns across scATAC-seq data sets. We additionally integrate our analysis with scRNA-seq data to identify orthogonal evidence for transcriptional regulators predicted by scATAC-seq analysis. Using publicly available scATAC-seq data, we find patterns that accurately characterize cell types both within and across data sets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these patterns are both consistent with current biological understanding and reflective of novel regulatory biology.
33151298	2021	Nucleic acids research	GRNdb: decoding the gene regulatory networks in diverse human and mouse conditions.	Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) formed by transcription factors (TFs) and their downstream target genes play essential roles in gene expression regulation. Moreover, GRNs can be dynamic changing across different conditions, which are crucial for understanding the underlying mechanisms of disease pathogenesis. However, no existing database provides comprehensive GRN information for various human and mouse normal tissues and diseases at the single-cell level. Based on the known TF-target relationships and the large-scale single-cell RNA-seq data collected from public databases as well as the bulk data of The Cancer Genome Atlas and the Genotype-Tissue Expression project, we systematically predicted the GRNs of 184 different physiological and pathological conditions of human and mouse involving >633 000 cells and >27 700 bulk samples. We further developed GRNdb, a freely accessible and user-friendly database (http://www.grndb.com/) for searching, comparing, browsing, visualizing, and downloading the predicted information of 77 746 GRNs, 19 687 841 TF-target pairs, and related binding motifs at single-cell/bulk resolution. GRNdb also allows users to explore the gene expression profile, correlations, and the associations between expression levels and the patient survival of diverse cancers. Overall, GRNdb provides a valuable and timely resource to the scientific community to elucidate the functions and mechanisms of gene expression regulation in various conditions.
34376223	2021	Genome biology	SCAPTURE: a deep learning-embedded pipeline that captures polyadenylation information from 3' tag-based RNA-seq of single cells.	Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) profiles gene expression with high resolution. Here, we develop a stepwise computational method-called SCAPTURE to identify, evaluate, and quantify cleavage and polyadenylation sites (PASs) from 3' tag-based scRNA-seq. SCAPTURE detects PASs de novo in single cells with high sensitivity and accuracy, enabling detection of previously unannotated PASs. Quantified alternative PAS transcripts refine cell identity analysis beyond gene expression, enriching information extracted from scRNA-seq data. Using SCAPTURE, we show changes of PAS usage in PBMCs from infected versus healthy individuals at single-cell resolution.
30961669	2019	Genome biology	Comparative analysis of sequencing technologies for single-cell transcriptomics.	Single-cell RNA-seq technologies require library preparation prior to sequencing. Here, we present the first report to compare the cheaper BGISEQ-500 platform to the Illumina HiSeq platform for scRNA-seq. We generate a resource of 468 single cells and 1297 matched single cDNA samples, performing SMARTer and Smart-seq2 protocols on two cell lines with RNA spike-ins. We sequence these libraries on both platforms using single- and paired-end reads. The platforms have comparable sensitivity and accuracy in terms of quantification of gene expression, and low technical variability. Our study provides a standardized scRNA-seq resource to benchmark new scRNA-seq library preparation protocols and sequencing platforms.
37862243	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Inference of differential key regulatory networks and mechanistic drug repurposing candidates from scRNA-seq data with SCANet.	MOTIVATION: The reconstruction of small key regulatory networks that explain the differences in the development of cell (sub)types from single-cell RNA sequencing is a yet unresolved computational problem. RESULTS: To this end, we have developed SCANet, an all-in-one package for single-cell profiling that covers the whole differential mechanotyping workflow, from inference of trait/cell-type-specific gene co-expression modules, driver gene detection, and transcriptional gene regulatory network reconstruction to mechanistic drug repurposing candidate prediction. To illustrate the power of SCANet, we examined data from two studies. First, we identify the drivers of the mechanotype of a cytokine storm associated with increased mortality in patients with acute respiratory illness. Secondly, we find 20 drugs for eight potential pharmacological targets in cellular driver mechanisms in the intestinal stem cells of obese mice. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: SCANet is a free, open-source, and user-friendly Python package that can be seamlessly integrated into single-cell-based systems medicine research and mechanistic drug discovery.
34782740	2022	Nature biotechnology	Locus-specific expression of transposable elements in single cells with CELLO-seq.	Transposable elements (TEs) regulate diverse biological processes, from early development to cancer. Expression of young TEs is difficult to measure with next-generation, single-cell sequencing technologies because their highly repetitive nature means that short complementary DNA reads cannot be unambiguously mapped to a specific locus. Single CELl LOng-read RNA-sequencing (CELLO-seq) combines long-read single cell RNA-sequencing with computational analyses to measure TE expression at unique loci. We used CELLO-seq to assess the widespread expression of TEs in two-cell mouse blastomeres as well as in human induced pluripotent stem cells. Across both species, old and young TEs showed evidence of locus-specific expression with simulations demonstrating that only a small number of very young elements in the mouse could not be mapped back to the reference with high confidence. Exploring the relationship between the expression of individual elements and putative regulators revealed large heterogeneity, with TEs within a class showing different patterns of correlation and suggesting distinct regulatory mechanisms.
33264392	2021	Nucleic acids research	CoolMPS for robust sequencing of single-nuclear RNAs captured by droplet-based method.	Massively-parallel single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq, snRNA-seq) requires extensive sequencing to achieve proper per-cell coverage, making sequencing resources and availability of sequencers critical factors for conducting deep transcriptional profiling. CoolMPS is a novel sequencing-by-synthesis approach that relies on nucleotide labeling by re-usable antibodies, but whether it is applicable to snRNA-seq has not been tested. Here, we use a low-cost and off-the-shelf protocol to chemically convert libraries generated with the widely-used Chromium 10X technology to be sequenceable with CoolMPS technology. To assess the quality and performance of converted libraries sequenced with CoolMPS, we generated a snRNA-seq dataset from the hippocampus of young and old mice. Native libraries were sequenced on an Illumina Novaseq and libraries that were converted to be compatible with CoolMPS were sequenced on a DNBSEQ-400RS. CoolMPS-derived data faithfully replicated key characteristics of the native library dataset, including correct estimation of ambient RNA-contamination, detection of captured cells, cell clustering results, spatial marker gene expression, inter- and intra-replicate differences and gene expression changes during aging. In conclusion, our results show that CoolMPS provides a viable alternative to standard sequencing of RNA from droplet-based libraries.
31392316	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scHinter: imputing dropout events for single-cell RNA-seq data with limited sample size.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is fast and becoming a powerful technique for studying dynamic gene regulation at unprecedented resolution. However, scRNA-seq data suffer from problems of extremely high dropout rate and cell-to-cell variability, demanding new methods to recover gene expression loss. Despite the availability of various dropout imputation approaches for scRNA-seq, most studies focus on data with a medium or large number of cells, while few studies have explicitly investigated the differential performance across different sample sizes or the applicability of the approach on small or imbalanced data. It is imperative to develop new imputation approaches with higher generalizability for data with various sample sizes. RESULTS: We proposed a method called scHinter for imputing dropout events for scRNA-seq with special emphasis on data with limited sample size. scHinter incorporates a voting-based ensemble distance and leverages the synthetic minority oversampling technique for random interpolation. A hierarchical framework is also embedded in scHinter to increase the reliability of the imputation for small samples. We demonstrated the ability of scHinter to recover gene expression measurements across a wide spectrum of scRNA-seq datasets with varied sample sizes. We comprehensively examined the impact of sample size and cluster number on imputation. Comprehensive evaluation of scHinter across diverse scRNA-seq datasets with imbalanced or limited sample size showed that scHinter achieved higher and more robust performance than competing approaches, including MAGIC, scImpute, SAVER and netSmooth. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Freely available for download at https://github.com/BMILAB/scHinter. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
37183449	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	scAnno: a deconvolution strategy-based automatic cell type annotation tool for single-cell RNA-sequencing data sets.	Undoubtedly, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has changed the research landscape by providing insights into heterogeneous, complex and rare cell populations. Given that more such data sets will become available in the near future, their accurate assessment with compatible and robust models for cell type annotation is a prerequisite. Considering this, herein, we developed scAnno (scRNA-seq data annotation), an automated annotation tool for scRNA-seq data sets primarily based on the single-cell cluster levels, using a joint deconvolution strategy and logistic regression. We explicitly constructed a reference profile for human (30 cell types and 50 human tissues) and a reference profile for mouse (26 cell types and 50 mouse tissues) to support this novel methodology (scAnno). scAnno offers a possibility to obtain genes with high expression and specificity in a given cell type as cell type-specific genes (marker genes) by combining co-expression genes with seed genes as a core. Of importance, scAnno can accurately identify cell type-specific genes based on cell type reference expression profiles without any prior information. Particularly, in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell data set, the marker genes identified by scAnno showed cell type-specific expression, and the majority of marker genes matched exactly with those included in the CellMarker database. Besides validating the flexibility and interpretability of scAnno in identifying marker genes, we also proved its superiority in cell type annotation over other cell type annotation tools (SingleR, scPred, CHETAH and scmap-cluster) through internal validation of data sets (average annotation accuracy: 99.05%) and cross-platform data sets (average annotation accuracy: 95.56%). Taken together, we established the first novel methodology that utilizes a deconvolution strategy for automated cell typing and is capable of being a significant application in broader scRNA-seq analysis. scAnno is available at https://github.com/liuhong-jia/scAnno.
32449934	2020	Nucleic acids research	ASAP 2020 update: an open, scalable and interactive web-based portal for (single-cell) omics analyses.	Single-cell omics enables researchers to dissect biological systems at a resolution that was unthinkable just 10 years ago. However, this analytical revolution also triggered new demands in 'big data' management, forcing researchers to stay up to speed with increasingly complex analytical processes and rapidly evolving methods. To render these processes and approaches more accessible, we developed the web-based, collaborative portal ASAP (Automated Single-cell Analysis Portal). Our primary goal is thereby to democratize single-cell omics data analyses (scRNA-seq and more recently scATAC-seq). By taking advantage of a Docker system to enhance reproducibility, and novel bioinformatics approaches that were recently developed for improving scalability, ASAP meets challenging requirements set by recent cell atlasing efforts such as the Human (HCA) and Fly (FCA) Cell Atlas Projects. Specifically, ASAP can now handle datasets containing millions of cells, integrating intuitive tools that allow researchers to collaborate on the same project synchronously. ASAP tools are versioned, and researchers can create unique access IDs for storing complete analyses that can be reproduced or completed by others. Finally, ASAP does not require any installation and provides a full and modular single-cell RNA-seq analysis pipeline. ASAP is freely available at https://asap.epfl.ch.
29622030	2018	Genome biology	Mapping human pluripotent stem cell differentiation pathways using high throughput single-cell RNA-sequencing.	BACKGROUND: Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) provide powerful models for studying cellular differentiations and unlimited sources of cells for regenerative medicine. However, a comprehensive single-cell level differentiation roadmap for hPSCs has not been achieved. RESULTS: We use high throughput single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), based on optimized microfluidic circuits, to profile early differentiation lineages in the human embryoid body system. We present a cellular-state landscape for hPSC early differentiation that covers multiple cellular lineages, including neural, muscle, endothelial, stromal, liver, and epithelial cells. Through pseudotime analysis, we construct the developmental trajectories of these progenitor cells and reveal the gene expression dynamics in the process of cell differentiation. We further reprogram primed H9 cells into naive-like H9 cells to study the cellular-state transition process. We find that genes related to hemogenic endothelium development are enriched in naive-like H9. Functionally, naive-like H9 show higher potency for differentiation into hematopoietic lineages than primed cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our single-cell analysis reveals the cellular-state landscape of hPSC early differentiation, offering new insights that can be harnessed for optimization of differentiation protocols.
30590489	2019	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	M3Drop: dropout-based feature selection for scRNASeq.	MOTIVATION: Most genomes contain thousands of genes, but for most functional responses, only a subset of those genes are relevant. To facilitate many single-cell RNASeq (scRNASeq) analyses the set of genes is often reduced through feature selection, i.e. by removing genes only subject to technical noise. RESULTS: We present M3Drop, an R package that implements popular existing feature selection methods and two novel methods which take advantage of the prevalence of zeros (dropouts) in scRNASeq data to identify features. We show these new methods outperform existing methods on simulated and real datasets. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: M3Drop is freely available on github as an R package and is compatible with other popular scRNASeq tools: https://github.com/tallulandrews/M3Drop. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
39543283	2025	Nature methods	A comprehensive human embryo reference tool using single-cell RNA-sequencing data.	Stem cell-based embryo models offer unprecedented experimental tools for studying early human development. The usefulness of embryo models hinges on their molecular, cellular and structural fidelities to their in vivo counterparts. To authenticate human embryo models, single-cell RNA sequencing has been utilized for unbiased transcriptional profiling. However, an organized and integrated human single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset, serving as a universal reference for benchmarking human embryo models, remains unavailable. Here we developed such a reference through the integration of six published human datasets covering development from the zygote to the gastrula. Lineage annotations are contrasted and validated with available human and nonhuman primate datasets. Using stabilized Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection, we constructed an early embryogenesis prediction tool, where query datasets can be projected on the reference and annotated with predicted cell identities. Using this reference tool, we examined published human embryo models, highlighting the risk of misannotation when relevant references are not utilized for benchmarking and authentication.
29659703	2018	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	B-cell receptor reconstruction from single-cell RNA-seq with VDJPuzzle.	MOTIVATION: The B-cell receptor (BCR) performs essential functions for the adaptive immune system including recognition of pathogen-derived antigens. The vast repertoire and adaptive variation of BCR sequences due to V(D)J recombination and somatic hypermutation necessitates single-cell characterization of BCR sequences. Single-cell RNA sequencing presents the opportunity for simultaneous capture of paired BCR heavy and light chains and the transcriptomic signature. RESULTS: We developed VDJPuzzle, a novel bioinformatic tool that reconstructs productive, full-length B-cell receptor sequences of both heavy and light chains and extract somatic mutations on the VDJ region. VDJPuzzle successfully reconstructed BCRs from 100% (n=117) human and 96.5% (n=200) murine B cells. The reconstructed BCRs were successfully validated with single-cell Sanger sequencing. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: VDJPuzzle is available at https://bitbucket.org/kirbyvisp/vdjpuzzle2. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
39446194	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Structure-preserved integration of scRNA-seq data using heterogeneous graph neural network.	The integration of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from multiple experimental batches enables more comprehensive characterizations of cell states. Given that existing methods disregard the structural information between cells and genes, we proposed a structure-preserved scRNA-seq data integration approach using heterogeneous graph neural network (scHetG). By establishing a heterogeneous graph that represents the interactions between multiple batches of cells and genes, and combining a heterogeneous graph neural network with contrastive learning, scHetG concurrently obtained cell and gene embeddings with structural information. A comprehensive assessment covering different species, tissues and scales indicated that scHetG is an efficacious method for eliminating batch effects while preserving the structural information of cells and genes, including batch-specific cell types and cell-type specific gene co-expression patterns.
34718405	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	Are dropout imputation methods for scRNA-seq effective for scATAC-seq data?	The tremendous progress of single-cell sequencing technology has given researchers the opportunity to study cell development and differentiation processes at single-cell resolution. Assay of Transposase-Accessible Chromatin by deep sequencing (ATAC-seq) was proposed for genome-wide analysis of chromatin accessibility. Due to technical limitations or other reasons, dropout events are almost a common occurrence for extremely sparse single-cell ATAC-seq data, leading to confusion in downstream analysis (such as clustering). Although considerable progress has been made in the estimation of scRNA-seq data, there is currently no specific method for the inference of dropout events in single-cell ATAC-seq data. In this paper, we select several state-of-the-art scRNA-seq imputation methods (including MAGIC, SAVER, scImpute, deepImpute, PRIME, bayNorm and knn-smoothing) in recent years to infer dropout peaks in scATAC-seq data, and perform a systematic evaluation of these methods through several downstream analyses. Specifically, we benchmarked these methods in terms of correlation with meta-cell, clustering, subpopulations distance analysis, imputation performance for corruption datasets, identification of TF motifs and computation time. The experimental results indicated that most of the imputed peaks increased the correlation with the reference meta-cell, while the performance of different methods on different datasets varied greatly in different downstream analyses, thus should be used with caution. In general, MAGIC performed better than the other methods most consistently across all assessments. Our source code is freely available at https://github.com/yueyueliu/scATAC-master.
37012448	2024	Nature biotechnology	A relay velocity model infers cell-dependent RNA velocity.	RNA velocity provides an approach for inferring cellular state transitions from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Conventional RNA velocity models infer universal kinetics from all cells in an scRNA-seq experiment, resulting in unpredictable performance in experiments with multi-stage and/or multi-lineage transition of cell states where the assumption of the same kinetic rates for all cells no longer holds. Here we present cellDancer, a scalable deep neural network that locally infers velocity for each cell from its neighbors and then relays a series of local velocities to provide single-cell resolution inference of velocity kinetics. In the simulation benchmark, cellDancer shows robust performance in multiple kinetic regimes, high dropout ratio datasets and sparse datasets. We show that cellDancer overcomes the limitations of existing RNA velocity models in modeling erythroid maturation and hippocampus development. Moreover, cellDancer provides cell-specific predictions of transcription, splicing and degradation rates, which we identify as potential indicators of cell fate in the mouse pancreas.
38439545	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	BERMAD: batch effect removal for single-cell RNA-seq data using a multi-layer adaptation autoencoder with dual-channel framework.	MOTIVATION: Removal of batch effect between multiple datasets from different experimental platforms has become an urgent problem, since single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) techniques developed rapidly. Although there have been some methods for this problem, most of them still face the challenge of under-correction or over-correction. Specifically, handling batch effect in highly nonlinear scRNA-seq data requires a more powerful model to address under-correction. In the meantime, some previous methods focus too much on removing difference between batches, which may disturb the biological signal heterogeneity of datasets generated from different experiments, thereby leading to over-correction. RESULTS: In this article, we propose a novel multi-layer adaptation autoencoder with dual-channel framework to address the under-correction and over-correction problems in batch effect removal, which is called BERMAD and can achieve better results of scRNA-seq data integration and joint analysis. First, we design a multi-layer adaptation architecture to model distribution difference between batches from different feature granularities. The distribution matching on various layers of autoencoder with different feature dimensions can result in more accurate batch correction outcome. Second, we propose a dual-channel framework, where the deep autoencoder processing each single dataset is independently trained. Hence, the heterogeneous information that is not shared between different batches can be retained more completely, which can alleviate over-correction. Comprehensive experiments on multiple scRNA-seq datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art methods. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The code implemented in Python and the data used for experiments have been released on GitHub (https://github.com/zhanglabNKU/BERMAD) and Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/records/10695073) with detailed instructions.
40796281	2025	Genome research	Intergenic accumulation of RNA polymerase II maintains the potential for swift transcriptional restart upon release from quiescence.	Quiescent (Q) cells are seemingly inactive, developmentally arrested cells, whose universal characteristic is the ability to promptly re-enter the cell cycle upon sensing of external cues. Q cells are responsive to the environment and flexible enough to adapt to available resources. In budding yeast, quiescent nuclear features are drastically distinct from those observed in nutrient replete conditions: The nuclear volume is reduced; the telomeres relocate from the nuclear periphery to the center of the nucleus into a hypercluster; chromatin is found in a compacted, hypoacetylated state; and transcription is globally shutdown. Yet, Q cells can restart transcription within minutes of refeeding. Here, we follow the global decrease of transcription in sorted, developing Q populations and its reactivation upon release. We find that transcription and telomere clustering dynamics in and out of quiescence are independent events. We report a genome-wide redistribution of the transcription machinery as cells progress into quiescence. Although most genes are shut down, 3% of coding genes remain active. Furthermore, RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) accumulates at one-third of gene promoters. The corresponding genes are highly enriched among those showing a high level of transcription and high frequency of expression in individual cells, shortly after cells are refed, as monitored by single-cell RNA-seq. Our results point toward a role for quiescent-specific RNAPII distribution to ensure a rapid and robust transcriptional response upon return to growth.
28973464	2017	Nucleic acids research	Using neural networks for reducing the dimensions of single-cell RNA-Seq data.	While only recently developed, the ability to profile expression data in single cells (scRNA-Seq) has already led to several important studies and findings. However, this technology has also raised several new computational challenges. These include questions about the best methods for clustering scRNA-Seq data, how to identify unique group of cells in such experiments, and how to determine the state or function of specific cells based on their expression profile. To address these issues we develop and test a method based on neural networks (NN) for the analysis and retrieval of single cell RNA-Seq data. We tested various NN architectures, some of which incorporate prior biological knowledge, and used these to obtain a reduced dimension representation of the single cell expression data. We show that the NN method improves upon prior methods in both, the ability to correctly group cells in experiments not used in the training and the ability to correctly infer cell type or state by querying a database of tens of thousands of single cell profiles. Such database queries (which can be performed using our web server) will enable researchers to better characterize cells when analyzing heterogeneous scRNA-Seq samples.
34931240	2022	Nucleic acids research	CCPE: cell cycle pseudotime estimation for single cell RNA-seq data.	Pseudotime analysis from scRNA-seq data enables to characterize the continuous progression of various biological processes, such as the cell cycle. Cell cycle plays an important role in cell fate decisions and differentiation and is often regarded as a confounder in scRNA-seq data analysis when analyzing the role of other factors. Therefore, accurate prediction of cell cycle pseudotime and identification of cell cycle stages are important steps for characterizing the development-related biological processes. Here, we develop CCPE, a novel cell cycle pseudotime estimation method to characterize cell cycle timing and identify cell cycle phases from scRNA-seq data. CCPE uses a discriminative helix to characterize the circular process of the cell cycle and estimates each cell's pseudotime along the cell cycle. We evaluated the performance of CCPE based on a variety of simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets. Our results indicate that CCPE is an effective method for cell cycle estimation and competitive in various applications compared with other existing methods. CCPE successfully identified cell cycle marker genes and is robust to dropout events in scRNA-seq data. Accurate prediction of the cell cycle using CCPE can also effectively facilitate the removal of cell cycle effects across cell types or conditions.
31675098	2020	Briefings in bioinformatics	Evaluation of single-cell classifiers for single-cell RNA sequencing data sets.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been rapidly developing and widely applied in biological and medical research. Identification of cell types in scRNA-seq data sets is an essential step before in-depth investigations of their functional and pathological roles. However, the conventional workflow based on clustering and marker genes is not scalable for an increasingly large number of scRNA-seq data sets due to complicated procedures and manual annotation. Therefore, a number of tools have been developed recently to predict cell types in new data sets using reference data sets. These methods have not been generally adapted due to a lack of tool benchmarking and user guidance. In this article, we performed a comprehensive and impartial evaluation of nine classification software tools specifically designed for scRNA-seq data sets. Results showed that Seurat based on random forest, SingleR based on correlation analysis and CaSTLe based on XGBoost performed better than others. A simple ensemble voting of all tools can improve the predictive accuracy. Under nonideal situations, such as small-sized and class-imbalanced reference data sets, tools based on cluster-level similarities have superior performance. However, even with the function of assigning 'unassigned' labels, it is still challenging to catch novel cell types by solely using any of the single-cell classifiers. This article provides a guideline for researchers to select and apply suitable classification tools in their analysis workflows and sheds some lights on potential direction of future improvement on classification tools.
31913438	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	BEM: Mining Coregulation Patterns in Transcriptomics via Boolean Matrix Factorization.	MOTIVATION: The matrix factorization is an important way to analyze coregulation patterns in transcriptomic data, which can reveal the tumor signal perturbation status and subtype classification. However, current matrix factorization methods do not provide clear bicluster structure. Furthermore, these algorithms are based on the assumption of linear combination, which may not be sufficient to capture the coregulation patterns. RESULTS: We presented a new algorithm for Boolean matrix factorization (BMF) via expectation maximization (BEM). BEM is more aligned with the molecular mechanism of transcriptomic coregulation and can scale to matrix with over 100 million data points. Synthetic experiments showed that BEM outperformed other BMF methods in terms of reconstruction error. Real-world application demonstrated that BEM is applicable to all kinds of transcriptomic data, including bulk RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomic datasets. Given appropriate binarization, BEM was able to extract coregulation patterns consistent with disease subtypes, cell types or spatial anatomy. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Python source code of BEM is available on https://github.com/LifanLiang/EM_BMF. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
33822873	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	Critical downstream analysis steps for single-cell RNA sequencing data.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has enabled us to study biological questions at the single-cell level. Currently, many analysis tools are available to better utilize these relatively noisy data. In this review, we summarize the most widely used methods for critical downstream analysis steps (i.e. clustering, trajectory inference, cell-type annotation and integrating datasets). The advantages and limitations are comprehensively discussed, and we provide suggestions for choosing proper methods in different situations. We hope this paper will be useful for scRNA-seq data analysts and bioinformatics tool developers.
30222169	2018	Nature biotechnology	Paired-cell sequencing enables spatial gene expression mapping of liver endothelial cells.	Spatially resolved single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) is a powerful approach for inferring connections between a cell's identity and its position in a tissue. We recently combined scRNAseq with spatially mapped landmark genes to infer the expression zonation of hepatocytes. However, determining zonation of small cells with low mRNA content, or without highly expressed landmark genes, remains challenging. Here we used paired-cell sequencing, in which mRNA from pairs of attached mouse cells were sequenced and gene expression from one cell type was used to infer the pairs' tissue coordinates. We applied this method to pairs of hepatocytes and liver endothelial cells (LECs). Using the spatial information from hepatocytes, we reconstructed LEC zonation and extracted a landmark gene panel that we used to spatially map LEC scRNAseq data. Our approach revealed the expression of both Wnt ligands and the Dkk3 Wnt antagonist in distinct pericentral LEC sub-populations. This approach can be used to reconstruct spatial expression maps of non-parenchymal cells in other tissues.
33999185	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	FBA: feature barcoding analysis for single cell RNA-Seq.	MOTIVATION: Single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) has broadened our understanding of cellular heterogeneity and provided valuable insights into cellular functions. Recent experimental strategies extend scRNA-Seq readouts to include additional features, including cell surface proteins and genomic perturbations. These 'feature barcoding' strategies rely on converting molecular and cellular features to unique sequence barcodes, which are then detected with the transcriptome. RESULTS: Here, we introduce FBA, a flexible and streamlined package to perform quality control, quantification, demultiplexing, multiplet detection, clustering and visualization of feature barcoding assays. AVAILABILITYAND IMPLEMENTATION: FBA is available on PyPi at https://pypi.org/project/fba and on GitHub at https://github.com/jlduan/fba. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
39749664	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Online-adjusted evolutionary biclustering algorithm to identify significant modules in gene expression data.	Analyzing gene expression data helps the identification of significant biological relationships in genes. With a growing number of open biological datasets available, it is paramount to use reliable and innovative methods to perform in-depth analyses of biological data and ensure that informed decisions are made based on accurate information. Evolutionary algorithms have been successful in the analysis of biological datasets. However, there is still room for improvement, and further analysis should be conducted. In this work, we propose Online-Adjusted EVOlutionary Biclustering algorithm (OAEVOB), a novel evolutionary-based biclustering algorithm that efficiently handles vast gene expression data. OAEVOB incorporates an online-adjustment feature that efficiently identifies significant groups by updating the mutation probability and crossover parameters. We utilize measurements such as Pearson correlation, distance correlation, biweight midcorrelation, and mutual information to assess the similarity of genes in the biclusters. Algorithms in the specialized literature do not address generalization to diverse gene expression sources. Therefore, to evaluate OAEVOB's performance, we analyzed six gene expression datasets obtained from diverse sequencing data sources, specifically Deoxyribonucleic Acid microarray, Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) sequencing, and single-cell RNA sequencing, which are subject to a thorough examination. OAEVOB identified significant broad gene expression biclusters with correlations greater than $0.5$ across all similarity measurements employed. Additionally, when biclusters are evaluated by functional enrichment analysis, they exhibit biological functions, suggesting that OAEVOB effectively identifies biclusters with specific cancer and tissue-related genes in the analyzed datasets. We compared the OAEVOB's performance with state-of-the-art methods and outperformed them showing robustness to noise, overlapping, sequencing data sources, and gene coverage.
41233159	2025	Genome research	Unified integration of spatial transcriptomics across platforms with LLOKI.	Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has transformed our understanding of tissue architecture and cellular interactions, but integrating ST data across platforms remains challenging due to differences in gene panels, data sparsity, and technical variability. Here, we introduce LLOKI, a novel framework for integrating imaging-based ST data from diverse platforms without requiring shared gene panels. LLOKI addresses ST integration through two key alignment tasks: feature alignment across technologies and batch alignment across data sets. Optimal transport-guided feature propagation adjusts data sparsity to match scRNA-seq references through graph-based imputation, enabling single-cell foundation models such as scGPT to generate unified features. Batch alignment then refines scGPT-transformed embeddings, mitigating batch effects while preserving biological variability. Evaluations on mouse brain samples from five different technologies demonstrate that LLOKI outperforms existing methods and is effective for cross-technology spatial gene program identification, and tissue slice alignment. Applying LLOKI to five ovarian cancer data sets, we identify an integrated gene program indicative of tumor-infiltrating T cells across gene panels. Together, LLOKI provides a robust foundation for cross-platform ST studies, with the potential to scale to large atlas data sets, enabling deeper insights into cellular organization and tissue environments.
40796171	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Mitigation of multi-scale biases in cell-type deconvolution for spatially resolved transcriptomics using HarmoDecon.	MOTIVATION: The advent of spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) has revolutionized our understanding of tissue molecular microenvironments by enabling the study of gene expression in its spatial context. However, many SRT platforms lack single-cell resolution, necessitating cell-type deconvolution methods to estimate cell-type proportions in SRT spots. Despite advancements in existing tools, these methods have not addressed biases occurring at three scales: individual spots, entire tissue samples, and discrepancies between SRT and reference scRNA-seq datasets. These biases result in overbalanced cell-type proportions for each spot, mismatched cell-type fractions at the sample level, and data distribution shifts across platforms. RESULTS: To mitigate these biases, we introduce HarmoDecon, a novel semi-supervised deep learning model for spatial cell-type deconvolution. HarmoDecon leverages pseudo-spots derived from scRNA-seq data and uses Gaussian Mixture Graph Convolutional Networks to address the aforementioned issues. Through extensive simulations on multi-cell spots from STARmap and osmFISH, HarmoDecon outperformed 11 state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, when applied to legacy SRT platforms and 10x Visium datasets, HarmoDecon achieved the highest accuracy in spatial domain clustering and maintained strong correlations between cancer marker genes and cancer cells in human breast cancer samples. These results highlight the utility of HarmoDecon in advancing spatial transcriptomics analysis. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The HarmoDecon scripts, with the detailed tutorials, are available at https://github.com/ericcombiolab/HarmoDecon/tree/main.
38517692	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	scHybridBERT: integrating gene regulation and cell graph for spatiotemporal dynamics in single-cell clustering.	Graph learning models have received increasing attention in the computational analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Compared with conventional deep neural networks, graph neural networks and language models have exhibited superior performance by extracting graph-structured data from raw gene count matrices. Established deep neural network-based clustering approaches generally focus on temporal expression patterns while ignoring inherent interactions at gene-level as well as cell-level, which could be regarded as spatial dynamics in single-cell data. Both gene-gene and cell-cell interactions are able to boost the performance of cell type detection, under the framework of multi-view modeling. In this study, spatiotemporal embedding and cell graphs are extracted to capture spatial dynamics at the molecular level. In order to enhance the accuracy of cell type detection, this study proposes the scHybridBERT architecture to conduct multi-view modeling of scRNA-seq data using extracted spatiotemporal patterns. In this scHybridBERT method, graph learning models are employed to deal with cell graphs and the Performer model employs spatiotemporal embeddings. Experimental outcomes about benchmark scRNA-seq datasets indicate that the proposed scHybridBERT method is able to enhance the accuracy of single-cell clustering tasks by integrating spatiotemporal embeddings and cell graphs.
39799000	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Supervised analysis of alternative polyadenylation from single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data with spvAPA.	Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is an important driver of transcriptome diversity that generates messenger RNA isoforms with distinct 3' ends. The rapid development of single-cell and spatial transcriptomic technologies opened up new opportunities for exploring APA data to discover hidden cell subpopulations invisible in conventional gene expression analysis. However, conventional gene-level analysis tools are not fully applicable to APA data, and commonly used unsupervised dimensionality reduction methods often disregard experimentally derived annotations such as cell type identities. Here, we proposed a supervised analytical framework termed spvAPA, specifically used for APA analysis from both single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data. First, an iterative imputation method based on weighted nearest neighbor was designed to recover missing APA signatures, by integrating both gene expression and APA modalities. Second, a supervised feature selection method based on sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis was devised to identify APA features distinguishing cell types or spatial morphologies. Additionally, spvAPA improves the visualization of high-dimensional data for discovering novel cell subtypes, which considers APA features and dual modalities of gene expression and APA. Evaluations across nine single-cell and spatial transcriptomics datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of spvAPA. spvAPA is available at https://github.com/BMILAB/spvAPA.
33693880	2021	Nucleic acids research	Multiplex indexing approach for the detection of DNase I hypersensitive sites in single cells.	Single cell chromatin accessibility assays reveal epigenomic variability at cis-regulatory elements among individual cells. We previously developed a single-cell DNase-seq assay (scDNase-seq) to profile accessible chromatin in a limited number of single cells. Here, we report a novel indexing strategy to resolve single-cell DNase hypersensitivity profiles based on bulk cell analysis. This new technique, termed indexing single-cell DNase sequencing (iscDNase-seq), employs the activities of terminal DNA transferase (TdT) and T4 DNA ligase to add unique cell barcodes to DNase-digested chromatin ends. By a three-layer indexing strategy, it allows profiling genome-wide DHSs for >15 000 single-cells in a single experiment. Application of iscDNase-seq to human white blood cells accurately revealed specific cell types and inferred regulatory transcription factors (TF) specific to each cell type. We found that iscDNase-seq detected DHSs with specific properties related to gene expression and conservation missed by scATAC-seq for the same cell type. Also, we found that the cell-to-cell variation in accessibility computed using iscDNase-seq data is significantly correlated with the cell-to-cell variation in gene expression. Importantly, this correlation is significantly higher than that between scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq, suggesting that iscDNase-seq data can better predict the cellular heterogeneity in gene expression compared to scATAC-seq. Thus, iscDNase-seq is an attractive alternative method for single-cell epigenomics studies.
30102702	2018	PLoS computational biology	SILGGM: An extensive R package for efficient statistical inference in large-scale gene networks.	Gene co-expression network analysis is extremely useful in interpreting a complex biological process. The recent droplet-based single-cell technology is able to generate much larger gene expression data routinely with thousands of samples and tens of thousands of genes. To analyze such a large-scale gene-gene network, remarkable progress has been made in rigorous statistical inference of high-dimensional Gaussian graphical model (GGM). These approaches provide a formal confidence interval or a p-value rather than only a single point estimator for conditional dependence of a gene pair and are more desirable for identifying reliable gene networks. To promote their widespread use, we herein introduce an extensive and efficient R package named SILGGM (Statistical Inference of Large-scale Gaussian Graphical Model) that includes four main approaches in statistical inference of high-dimensional GGM. Unlike the existing tools, SILGGM provides statistically efficient inference on both individual gene pair and whole-scale gene pairs. It has a novel and consistent false discovery rate (FDR) procedure in all four methodologies. Based on the user-friendly design, it provides outputs compatible with multiple platforms for interactive network visualization. Furthermore, comparisons in simulation illustrate that SILGGM can accelerate the existing MATLAB implementation to several orders of magnitudes and further improve the speed of the already very efficient R package FastGGM. Testing results from the simulated data confirm the validity of all the approaches in SILGGM even in a very large-scale setting with the number of variables or genes to a ten thousand level. We have also applied our package to a novel single-cell RNA-seq data set with pan T cells. The results show that the approaches in SILGGM significantly outperform the conventional ones in a biological sense. The package is freely available via CRAN at https://cran.r-project.org/package=SILGGM.
35801910	2022	Nucleic acids research	Systemic approaches using single cell transcriptome reveal that C/EBPgamma regulates autophagy under amino acid starved condition.	Autophagy, a catabolic process to remove unnecessary or dysfunctional organelles, is triggered by various signals including nutrient starvation. Depending on the types of the nutrient deficiency, diverse sensing mechanisms and signaling pathways orchestrate for transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of autophagy. However, our knowledge about nutrient type-specific transcriptional regulation during autophagy is limited. To understand nutrient type-dependent transcriptional mechanisms during autophagy, we performed single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) in the mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with or without glucose starvation (GS) as well as amino acid starvation (AAS). Trajectory analysis using scRNAseq identified sequential induction of potential transcriptional regulators for each condition. Gene regulatory rules inferred using TENET newly identified CCAAT/enhancer binding protein gamma (C/EBPgamma) as a regulator of autophagy in AAS, but not GS, condition, and knockdown experiment confirmed the TENET result. Cell biological and biochemical studies validated that activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) is responsible for conferring specificity to C/EBPgamma for the activation of autophagy genes under AAS, but not under GS condition. Together, our data identified C/EBPgamma as a previously unidentified key regulator under AAS-induced autophagy.
39690882	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	A novel computational model ITHCS for enhanced prognostic risk stratification in ESCC by correcting for intratumor heterogeneity.	Intratumor heterogeneity significantly challenges the accuracy of existing prognostic models for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) by introducing biases related to the varied genetic and molecular landscapes within tumors. Traditional models, relying on single-sample, single-region bulk RNA sequencing, fall short of capturing the complexity of intratumor heterogeneity. To fill this gap, we developed a computational model for intratumor heterogeneity corrected signature (ITHCS) by employing both multiregion bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing to pinpoint genes that exhibit consistent expression patterns across different tumor regions but vary significantly among patients. Utilizing these genes, we applied multiple machine-learning algorithms for sophisticated feature selection and model construction. The ITHCS model significantly outperforms existing prognostic indicators in accuracy and generalizability, markedly reducing sampling biases caused by intratumor heterogeneity. This improvement is especially notable in the prognostic assessment of early-stage ESCC patients, where the model exhibits exceptional predictive power. Additionally, we found that the risk score based on ITHCS may be associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition characteristics, indicating that high-risk patients may exhibit a diminished efficacy to immunotherapy.
35773341	2022	Nature biotechnology	Frequent aneuploidy in primary human T cells after CRISPR-Cas9 cleavage.	Multiple clinical trials of allogeneic T cell therapy use site-specific nucleases to disrupt T cell receptor (TCR) and other genes(1-6). In this study, using single-cell RNA sequencing, we investigated genome editing outcomes in primary human T cells transfected with CRISPR-Cas9 and guide RNAs targeting genes for TCR chains and programmed cell death protein 1. Four days after transfection, we found a loss of chromosome 14, harboring the TCRalpha locus, in up to 9% of the cells and a chromosome 14 gain in up to 1.4% of the cells. Chromosome 7, harboring the TCRbeta locus, was truncated in 9.9% of the cells. Aberrations were validated using fluorescence in situ hybridization and digital droplet PCR. Aneuploidy was associated with reduced proliferation, induced p53 activation and cell death. However, at 11 days after transfection, 0.9% of T cells still had a chromosome 14 loss. Aneuploidy and chromosomal truncations are, thus, frequent outcomes of CRISPR-Cas9 cleavage that should be monitored and minimized in clinical protocols.
34850828	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	GNN-based embedding for clustering scRNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides transcriptomic profiling for individual cells, allowing researchers to study the heterogeneity of tissues, recognize rare cell identities and discover new cellular subtypes. Clustering analysis is usually used to predict cell class assignments and infer cell identities. However, the high sparsity of scRNA-seq data, accentuated by dropout events generates challenges that have motivated the development of numerous dedicated clustering methods. Nevertheless, there is still no consensus on the best performing method. RESULTS: graph-sc is a new method leveraging a graph autoencoder network to create embeddings for scRNA-seq cell data. While this work analyzes the performance of clustering the embeddings with various clustering algorithms, other downstream tasks can also be performed. A broad experimental study has been performed on both simulated and scRNA-seq datasets. The results indicate that although there is no consistently best method across all the analyzed datasets, graph-sc compares favorably to competing techniques across all types of datasets. Furthermore, the proposed method is stable across consecutive runs, robust to input down-sampling, generally insensitive to changes in the network architecture or training parameters and more computationally efficient than other competing methods based on neural networks. Modeling the data as a graph provides increased flexibility to define custom features characterizing the genes, the cells and their interactions. Moreover, external data (e.g. gene network) can easily be integrated into the graph and used seamlessly under the same optimization task. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: https://github.com/ciortanmadalina/graph-sc. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
33618746	2021	Genome biology	scSorter: assigning cells to known cell types according to marker genes.	On single-cell RNA-sequencing data, we consider the problem of assigning cells to known cell types, assuming that the identities of cell-type-specific marker genes are given but their exact expression levels are unavailable, that is, without using a reference dataset. Based on an observation that the expected over-expression of marker genes is often absent in a nonnegligible proportion of cells, we develop a method called scSorter. scSorter allows marker genes to express at a low level and borrows information from the expression of non-marker genes. On both simulated and real data, scSorter shows much higher power compared to existing methods.
36326081	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	BISC: accurate inference of transcriptional bursting kinetics from single-cell transcriptomic data.	Gene expression in mammalian cells is inherently stochastic and mRNAs are synthesized in discrete bursts. Single-cell transcriptomics provides an unprecedented opportunity to explore the transcriptome-wide kinetics of transcriptional bursting. However, current analysis methods provide limited accuracy in bursting inference due to substantial noise inherent to single-cell transcriptomic data. In this study, we developed BISC, a Bayesian method for inferring bursting parameters from single cell transcriptomic data. Based on a beta-gamma-Poisson model, BISC modeled the mean-variance dependency to achieve accurate estimation of bursting parameters from noisy data. Evaluation based on both simulation and real intron sequential RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization data showed improved accuracy and reliability of BISC over existing methods, especially for genes with low expression values. Further application of BISC found bursting frequency but not bursting size was strongly associated with gene expression regulation. Moreover, our analysis provided new mechanistic insights into the functional role of enhancer and superenhancer by modulating both bursting frequency and size. BISC also formulated a downstream framework to identify differential bursting (in frequency and size separately) genes in samples under different conditions. Applying to multiple datasets (a mouse embryonic cell and fibroblast dataset, a human immune cell dataset and a human pancreatic cell dataset), BISC identified known cell-type signature genes that were missed by differential expression analysis, providing additional insights in understanding the cell-specific stochastic gene transcription. Applying to datasets of human lung and colon cancers, BISC successfully detected tumor signature genes based on alterations in bursting kinetics, which illustrates its value in understanding disease development regarding transcriptional bursting. Collectively, BISC provides a new tool for accurately inferring bursting kinetics and detecting differential bursting genes. This study also produced new insights in the role of transcriptional bursting in regulating gene expression, cell identity and tumor progression.
37387178	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	CellBRF: a feature selection method for single-cell clustering using cell balance and random forest.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers a powerful tool to dissect the complexity of biological tissues through cell sub-population identification in combination with clustering approaches. Feature selection is a critical step for improving the accuracy and interpretability of single-cell clustering. Existing feature selection methods underutilize the discriminatory potential of genes across distinct cell types. We hypothesize that incorporating such information could further boost the performance of single cell clustering. RESULTS: We develop CellBRF, a feature selection method that considers genes' relevance to cell types for single-cell clustering. The key idea is to identify genes that are most important for discriminating cell types through random forests guided by predicted cell labels. Moreover, it proposes a class balancing strategy to mitigate the impact of unbalanced cell type distributions on feature importance evaluation. We benchmark CellBRF on 33 scRNA-seq datasets representing diverse biological scenarios and demonstrate that it substantially outperforms state-of-the-art feature selection methods in terms of clustering accuracy and cell neighborhood consistency. Furthermore, we demonstrate the outstanding performance of our selected features through three case studies on cell differentiation stage identification, non-malignant cell subtype identification, and rare cell identification. CellBRF provides a new and effective tool to boost single-cell clustering accuracy.

41325188	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Guided Co-clustering Transfer Across Unpaired and Paired single-cell Multi-omics Data.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell multi-omics technologies enable the simultaneous profiling of gene expression and chromatin accessibility, providing complementary insights into cellular identity and gene regulatory mechanisms. However, integrating paired scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data (i.e. profiles from the same single cell) remains challenging due to inherent sparsity, technical noise, and the limited availability of high-quality paired measurements. In contrast, large-scale unpaired scRNA-seq datasets often exhibit robust and biologically meaningful cell cluster structures. RESULTS: We introduce Guided Co-clustering Transfer (GuidedCoC), a novel framework that transfers structural knowledge from unpaired scRNA-seq source data to improve both cell clustering and feature alignment in paired scRNA-seq/scATAC-seq target data. GuidedCoC jointly co-clusters cells and features across modalities and domains via a unified information-theoretic objective, aligning gene expression modules with regulatory elements while implicitly performing cross-modal dimensionality reduction to reduce noise. Additionally, it automatically aligns cell populations across unpaired and paired datasets without requiring explicit annotations. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that GuidedCoC achieves superior clustering accuracy and biological interpretability compared to existing methods. These results highlight the promise of structure-guided transfer learning for robust, scalable, and interpretable integration of single-cell multi-omics data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: GuidedCoC is available as open-source code at https://github.com/No-AgCl/GuidedCoC. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
41219484	2025	Nature biotechnology	Multimodal learning enables chat-based exploration of single-cell data.	Single-cell sequencing characterizes biological samples at unprecedented scale and detail, but data interpretation remains challenging. Here, we present CellWhisperer, an artificial intelligence (AI) model and software tool for chat-based interrogation of gene expression. We establish a multimodal embedding of transcriptomes and their textual annotations, using contrastive learning on 1 million RNA sequencing profiles with AI-curated descriptions. This embedding informs a large language model that answers user-provided questions about cells and genes in natural-language chats. We benchmark CellWhisperer's performance for zero-shot prediction of cell types and other biological annotations and demonstrate its use for biological discovery in a meta-analysis of human embryonic development. We integrate a CellWhisperer chat box with the CELLxGENE browser, allowing users to interactively explore gene expression through a combined graphical and chat interface. In summary, CellWhisperer leverages large community-scale data repositories to connect transcriptomes and text, thereby enabling interactive exploration of single-cell RNA-sequencing data with natural-language chats.
31308548	2019	Nature methods	Joint analysis of heterogeneous single-cell RNA-seq dataset collections.	Single-cell RNA sequencing is often applied in study designs that include multiple individuals, conditions or tissues. To identify recurrent cell subpopulations in such heterogeneous collections, we developed Conos, an approach that relies on multiple plausible inter-sample mappings to construct a global graph connecting all measured cells. The graph enables identification of recurrent cell clusters and propagation of information between datasets in multi-sample or atlas-scale collections.
34620214	2021	Genome biology	Mapping and modeling the genomic basis of differential RNA isoform expression at single-cell resolution with LR-Split-seq.	The rise in throughput and quality of long-read sequencing should allow unambiguous identification of full-length transcript isoforms. However, its application to single-cell RNA-seq has been limited by throughput and expense. Here we develop and characterize long-read Split-seq (LR-Split-seq), which uses combinatorial barcoding to sequence single cells with long reads. Applied to the C2C12 myogenic system, LR-split-seq associates isoforms to cell types with relative economy and design flexibility. We find widespread evidence of changing isoform expression during differentiation including alternative transcription start sites (TSS) and/or alternative internal exon usage. LR-Split-seq provides an affordable method for identifying cluster-specific isoforms in single cells.
30445607	2019	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	pyNVR: investigating factors affecting feature selection from scRNA-seq data for lineage reconstruction.	MOTIVATION: The emergence of single-cell RNA-sequencing has enabled analyses that leverage transitioning cell states to reconstruct pseudotemporal trajectories. Multidimensional data sparsity, zero inflation and technical variation necessitate the selection of high-quality features that feed downstream analyses. Despite the development of numerous algorithms for the unsupervised selection of biologically relevant features, their differential performance remains largely unaddressed. RESULTS: We implemented the neighborhood variance ratio (NVR) feature selection approach as a Python package with substantial improvements in performance. In comparing NVR with multiple unsupervised algorithms such as dpFeature, we observed striking differences in features selected. We present evidence that quantifiable dataset properties have observable and predictable effects on the performance of these algorithms. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: pyNVR is freely available at https://github.com/KenLauLab/NVR. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
32873325	2020	Genome biology	pipeComp, a general framework for the evaluation of computational pipelines, reveals performant single cell RNA-seq preprocessing tools.	We present pipeComp ( https://github.com/plger/pipeComp ), a flexible R framework for pipeline comparison handling interactions between analysis steps and relying on multi-level evaluation metrics. We apply it to the benchmark of single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis pipelines using simulated and real datasets with known cell identities, covering common methods of filtering, doublet detection, normalization, feature selection, denoising, dimensionality reduction, and clustering. pipeComp can easily integrate any other step, tool, or evaluation metric, allowing extensible benchmarks and easy applications to other fields, as we demonstrate through a study of the impact of removal of unwanted variation on differential expression analysis.
32341560	2020	Nature biotechnology	Systematic comparison of single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing methods.	The scale and capabilities of single-cell RNA-sequencing methods have expanded rapidly in recent years, enabling major discoveries and large-scale cell mapping efforts. However, these methods have not been systematically and comprehensively benchmarked. Here, we directly compare seven methods for single-cell and/or single-nucleus profiling-selecting representative methods based on their usage and our expertise and resources to prepare libraries-including two low-throughput and five high-throughput methods. We tested the methods on three types of samples: cell lines, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and brain tissue, generating 36 libraries in six separate experiments in a single center. To directly compare the methods and avoid processing differences introduced by the existing pipelines, we developed scumi, a flexible computational pipeline that can be used with any single-cell RNA-sequencing method. We evaluated the methods for both basic performance, such as the structure and alignment of reads, sensitivity and extent of multiplets, and for their ability to recover known biological information in the samples.
38620017	2024	PLoS computational biology	Modeling single cell trajectory using forward-backward stochastic differential equations.	Recent advances in single-cell sequencing technology have provided opportunities for mathematical modeling of dynamic developmental processes at the single-cell level, such as inferring developmental trajectories. Optimal transport has emerged as a promising theoretical framework for this task by computing pairings between cells from different time points. However, optimal transport methods have limitations in capturing nonlinear trajectories, as they are static and can only infer linear paths between endpoints. In contrast, stochastic differential equations (SDEs) offer a dynamic and flexible approach that can model non-linear trajectories, including the shape of the path. Nevertheless, existing SDE methods often rely on numerical approximations that can lead to inaccurate inferences, deviating from true trajectories. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach combining forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDE) with a refined approximation procedure. Our FBSDE model integrates the forward and backward movements of two SDEs in time, aiming to capture the underlying dynamics of single-cell developmental trajectories. Through comprehensive benchmarking on multiple scRNA-seq datasets, we demonstrate the superior performance of FBSDE compared to other methods, highlighting its efficacy in accurately inferring developmental trajectories.
39535037	2025	Nucleic acids research	Rediscovering publicly available single-cell data with the DISCO platform.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as the key technique for studying transcriptomics at the single-cell level. In our previous work, we presented the DISCO database (https://www.immunesinglecell.org/) that integrates publicly available human scRNA-seq data. We now introduce an enhanced version of DISCO, which has expanded fourfold to include >100 million cells from >17 thousand samples. It provides uniformly realigned read count tables, curated metadata, integrated tissue and phenotype specific atlases, and harmonized cell type annotations. It also hosts a single-cell enhanced knowledgebase of cell type ontology and gene signatures relating to cell types and phenotypes. Lastly, it offers a suite of tools for data retrieval, integration, annotation, and mapping, allowing users to construct customized atlases and perform integrated analysis with their own data. These tools are also available in a standalone R package for offline analysis.
36191033	2022	PLoS computational biology	Variant calling enhances the identification of cancer cells in single-cell RNA sequencing data.	Single-cell RNA-sequencing is an invaluable research tool that allows for the investigation of gene expression in heterogeneous cancer cell populations in ways that bulk RNA-seq cannot. However, normal (i.e., non tumor) cells in cancer samples have the potential to confound the downstream analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data. Existing methods for identifying cancer and normal cells include copy number variation inference, marker-gene expression analysis, and expression-based clustering. This work aims to extend the existing approaches for identifying cancer cells in single-cell RNA-seq samples by incorporating variant calling and the identification of putative driver alterations. We found that putative driver alterations can be detected in single-cell RNA-seq data obtained with full-length transcript technologies and noticed that a subset of cells in tumor samples are enriched for putative driver alterations as compared to normal cells. Furthermore, we show that the number of putative driver alterations and inferred copy number variation are not correlated in all samples. Taken together, our findings suggest that augmenting existing cancer-cell filtering methods with variant calling and analysis can increase the number of tumor cells that can be confidently included in downstream analyses of single-cell full-length transcript RNA-seq datasets.
36823676	2023	Genome biology	Pitfalls and opportunities for applying latent variables in single-cell eQTL analyses.	Using latent variables in gene expression data can help correct unobserved confounders and increase statistical power for expression quantitative trait Loci (eQTL) detection. The probabilistic estimation of expression residuals (PEER) and principal component analysis (PCA) are widely used methods that can remove unwanted variation and improve eQTL discovery power in bulk RNA-seq analysis. However, their performance has not been evaluated extensively in single-cell eQTL analysis, especially for different cell types. Potential challenges arise due to the structure of single-cell RNA-seq data, including sparsity, skewness, and mean-variance relationship. Here, we show by a series of analyses that PEER and PCA require additional quality control and data transformation steps on the pseudo-bulk matrix to obtain valid latent variables; otherwise, it can result in highly correlated factors (Pearson's correlation r = 0.63 ~ 0.99). Incorporating valid PFs/PCs in the eQTL association model would identify 1.7 ~ 13.3% more eGenes. Sensitivity analysis showed that the pattern of change between the number of eGenes detected and fitted PFs/PCs varied significantly in different cell types. In addition, using highly variable genes to generate latent variables could achieve similar eGenes discovery power as using all genes but save considerable computational resources (~ 6.2-fold faster).
36575569	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	SimCH: simulation of single-cell RNA sequencing data by modeling cellular heterogeneity at gene expression level.	Single-cell ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been a powerful technology for transcriptome analysis. However, the systematic validation of diverse computational tools used in scRNA-seq analysis remains challenging. Here, we propose a novel simulation tool, termed as Simulation of Cellular Heterogeneity (SimCH), for the flexible and comprehensive assessment of scRNA-seq computational methods. The Gaussian Copula framework is recruited to retain gene coexpression of experimental data shown to be associated with cellular heterogeneity. The synthetic count matrices generated by suitable SimCH modes closely match experimental data originating from either homogeneous or heterogeneous cell populations and either unique molecular identifier (UMI)-based or non-UMI-based techniques. We demonstrate how SimCH can benchmark several types of computational methods, including cell clustering, discovery of differentially expressed genes, trajectory inference, batch correction and imputation. Moreover, we show how SimCH can be used to conduct power evaluation of cell clustering methods. Given these merits, we believe that SimCH can accelerate single-cell research.
29548006	2018	Nucleic acids research	Tn5Prime, a Tn5 based 5' capture method for single cell RNA-seq.	RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is a powerful technique to investigate and quantify entire transcriptomes. Recent advances in the field have made it possible to explore the transcriptomes of single cells. However, most widely used RNA-seq protocols fail to provide crucial information regarding transcription start sites. Here we present a protocol, Tn5Prime, that takes advantage of the Tn5 transposase-based Smart-seq2 protocol to create RNA-seq libraries that capture the 5' end of transcripts. The Tn5Prime method dramatically streamlines the 5' capture process and is both cost effective and reliable. By applying Tn5Prime to bulk RNA and single cell samples, we were able to define transcription start sites as well as quantify transcriptomes at high accuracy and reproducibility. Additionally, similar to 3' end-based high-throughput methods like Drop-seq and 10x Genomics Chromium, the 5' capture Tn5Prime method allows the introduction of cellular identifiers during reverse transcription, simplifying the analysis of large numbers of single cells. In contrast to 3' end-based methods, Tn5Prime also enables the assembly of the variable 5' ends of the antibody sequences present in single B-cell data. Therefore, Tn5Prime presents a robust tool for both basic and applied research into the adaptive immune system and beyond.
34331449	2021	Nucleic acids research	CellCall: integrating paired ligand-receptor and transcription factor activities for cell-cell communication.	With the dramatic development of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies, the systematic decoding of cell-cell communication has received great research interest. To date, several in-silico methods have been developed, but most of them lack the ability to predict the communication pathways connecting the insides and outsides of cells. Here, we developed CellCall, a toolkit to infer inter- and intracellular communication pathways by integrating paired ligand-receptor and transcription factor (TF) activity. Moreover, CellCall uses an embedded pathway activity analysis method to identify the significantly activated pathways involved in intercellular crosstalk between certain cell types. Additionally, CellCall offers a rich suite of visualization options (Circos plot, Sankey plot, bubble plot, ridge plot, etc.) to present the analysis results. Case studies on scRNA-seq datasets of human testicular cells and the tumor immune microenvironment demonstrated the reliable and unique functionality of CellCall in intercellular communication analysis and internal TF activity exploration, which were further validated experimentally. Comparative analysis of CellCall and other tools indicated that CellCall was more accurate and offered more functions. In summary, CellCall provides a sophisticated and practical tool allowing researchers to decipher intercellular communication and related internal regulatory signals based on scRNA-seq data. CellCall is freely available at https://github.com/ShellyCoder/cellcall.
40119479	2025	Genome biology	scVAEDer: integrating deep diffusion models and variational autoencoders for single-cell transcriptomics analysis.	Discovering a lower-dimensional embedding of single-cell data can improve downstream analysis. The embedding should encapsulate both the high-level features and low-level variations. While existing generative models attempt to learn such low-dimensional representations, they have limitations. Here, we introduce scVAEDer, a scalable deep-learning model that combines the power of variational autoencoders and deep diffusion models to learn a meaningful representation that retains both global structure and local variations. Using the learned embeddings, scVAEDer can generate novel scRNA-seq data, predict perturbation response on various cell types, identify changes in gene expression during dedifferentiation, and detect master regulators in biological processes.
33462509	2021	Nature biotechnology	Assessing single-cell transcriptomic variability through density-preserving data visualization.	Nonlinear data visualization methods, such as t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), summarize the complex transcriptomic landscape of single cells in two dimensions or three dimensions, but they neglect the local density of data points in the original space, often resulting in misleading visualizations where densely populated subsets of cells are given more visual space than warranted by their transcriptional diversity in the dataset. Here we present den-SNE and densMAP, which are density-preserving visualization tools based on t-SNE and UMAP, respectively, and demonstrate their ability to accurately incorporate information about transcriptomic variability into the visual interpretation of single-cell RNA sequencing data. Applied to recently published datasets, our methods reveal significant changes in transcriptomic variability in a range of biological processes, including heterogeneity in transcriptomic variability of immune cells in blood and tumor, human immune cell specialization and the developmental trajectory of Caenorhabditis elegans. Our methods are readily applicable to visualizing high-dimensional data in other scientific domains.
40694852	2025	Nucleic acids research	Spatial-scERA: a method for reconstructing spatial single-cell enhancer activity in multicellular organisms.	Enhancers play an essential role in developmental processes by regulating the spatiotemporal expression of genes. Characterizing their spatiotemporal activity remains however an important challenge. Here we introduce a novel in vivo/in silico method for spatial single-cell enhancer-reporter assays (spatial-scERA) designed to reconstruct the spatial activity of candidate enhancer regions in parallel in multicellular organisms. Spatial-scERA integrates parallel reporter assays with single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial reconstruction using optimal transport, to map cell-type-specific enhancer activity at the single-cell level on a 3D virtual sample. We evaluated spatial-scERA in Drosophila embryos using 25 candidate enhancers, and validated the robustness of our reconstructions by comparing them to in situ hybridization. Remarkably, spatial-scERA faithfully reconstructed the spatial activity of these enhancers, even when the reporter construct was expressed in as few as 10 cells. Our results demonstrate the importance of integrating transcriptomic and spatial data for accurately predicting enhancer activity patterns in complex multicellular samples and linking enhancers to their potential target genes. Overall, spatial-scERA provides a scalable approach to map the spatial activity of enhancers at single-cell resolution without the need for imaging or a priori knowledge of embryology and can be applied to any multicellular organism amenable to transgenesis.
28504683	2017	Nature methods	Normalizing single-cell RNA sequencing data: challenges and opportunities.	Single-cell transcriptomics is becoming an important component of the molecular biologist's toolkit. A critical step when analyzing data generated using this technology is normalization. However, normalization is typically performed using methods developed for bulk RNA sequencing or even microarray data, and the suitability of these methods for single-cell transcriptomics has not been assessed. We here discuss commonly used normalization approaches and illustrate how these can produce misleading results. Finally, we present alternative approaches and provide recommendations for single-cell RNA sequencing users.
39018178	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Controlled Noise: Evidence of epigenetic regulation of Single-Cell expression variability.	MOTIVATION: Understanding single-cell expression variability (scEV) or gene expression noise among cells of the same type and state is crucial for delineating population-level cellular function. While epigenetic mechanisms are widely implicated in gene expression regulation, a definitive link between chromatin accessibility and scEV remains elusive. Recent advances in single-cell techniques enable the study of single-cell multiomics data that include the simultaneous measurement of scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq within individual cells, presenting an unprecedented opportunity to address this gap. RESULTS: This paper introduces an innovative testing pipeline to investigate the association between chromatin accessibility and scEV. With single-cell multiomics data of scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq, the pipeline hinges on comparing the prediction performance of scATAC-seq data on gene expression levels between highly variable genes (HVGs) and non-highly variable genes (non-HVGs). Applying this pipeline to paired scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq data from human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, we observed a significantly superior prediction performance of scATAC-seq data for HVGs compared to non-HVGs. Notably, there was substantial overlap between well-predicted genes and HVGs. The gene pathways enriched from well-predicted genes are highly pertinent to cell type-specific functions. Our findings support the notion that scEV largely stems from cell-to-cell variability in chromatin accessibility, providing compelling evidence for the epigenetic regulation of scEV and offering promising avenues for investigating gene regulation mechanisms at the single-cell level. AVAILABILITY: The source code and data used in this paper can be found at https://github.com/SiweiCui/EpigeneticControlOfSingle-CellExpressionVariability.

35210612	2022	Nature biotechnology	Mitochondrial variant enrichment from high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing resolves clonal populations.	The combination of single-cell transcriptomics with mitochondrial DNA variant detection can be used to establish lineage relationships in primary human cells, but current methods are not scalable to interrogate complex tissues. Here, we combine common 3' single-cell RNA-sequencing protocols with mitochondrial transcriptome enrichment to increase coverage by more than 50-fold, enabling high-confidence mutation detection. The method successfully identifies skewed immune-cell expansions in primary human clonal hematopoiesis.
31740819	2019	Nature methods	Fast, sensitive and accurate integration of single-cell data with Harmony.	The emerging diversity of single-cell RNA-seq datasets allows for the full transcriptional characterization of cell types across a wide variety of biological and clinical conditions. However, it is challenging to analyze them together, particularly when datasets are assayed with different technologies, because biological and technical differences are interspersed. We present Harmony (https://github.com/immunogenomics/harmony), an algorithm that projects cells into a shared embedding in which cells group by cell type rather than dataset-specific conditions. Harmony simultaneously accounts for multiple experimental and biological factors. In six analyses, we demonstrate the superior performance of Harmony to previously published algorithms while requiring fewer computational resources. Harmony enables the integration of ~10(6) cells on a personal computer. We apply Harmony to peripheral blood mononuclear cells from datasets with large experimental differences, five studies of pancreatic islet cells, mouse embryogenesis datasets and the integration of scRNA-seq with spatial transcriptomics data.
38701412	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	scCRT: a contrastive-based dimensionality reduction model for scRNA-seq trajectory inference.	Trajectory inference is a crucial task in single-cell RNA-sequencing downstream analysis, which can reveal the dynamic processes of biological development, including cell differentiation. Dimensionality reduction is an important step in the trajectory inference process. However, most existing trajectory methods rely on cell features derived from traditional dimensionality reduction methods, such as principal component analysis and uniform manifold approximation and projection. These methods are not specifically designed for trajectory inference and fail to fully leverage prior information from upstream analysis, limiting their performance. Here, we introduce scCRT, a novel dimensionality reduction model for trajectory inference. In order to utilize prior information to learn accurate cells representation, scCRT integrates two feature learning components: a cell-level pairwise module and a cluster-level contrastive module. The cell-level module focuses on learning accurate cell representations in a reduced-dimensionality space while maintaining the cell-cell positional relationships in the original space. The cluster-level contrastive module uses prior cell state information to aggregate similar cells, preventing excessive dispersion in the low-dimensional space. Experimental findings from 54 real and 81 synthetic datasets, totaling 135 datasets, highlighted the superior performance of scCRT compared with commonly used trajectory inference methods. Additionally, an ablation study revealed that both cell-level and cluster-level modules enhance the model's ability to learn accurate cell features, facilitating cell lineage inference. The source code of scCRT is available at https://github.com/yuchen21-web/scCRT-for-scRNA-seq.
39823522	2025	PLoS computational biology	BuDDI: Bulk Deconvolution with Domain Invariance to predict cell-type-specific perturbations from bulk.	While single-cell experiments provide deep cellular resolution within a single sample, some single-cell experiments are inherently more challenging than bulk experiments due to dissociation difficulties, cost, or limited tissue availability. This creates a situation where we have deep cellular profiles of one sample or condition, and bulk profiles across multiple samples and conditions. To bridge this gap, we propose BuDDI (BUlk Deconvolution with Domain Invariance). BuDDI utilizes domain adaptation techniques to effectively integrate available corpora of case-control bulk and reference scRNA-seq observations to infer cell-type-specific perturbation effects. BuDDI achieves this by learning independent latent spaces within a single variational autoencoder (VAE) encompassing at least four sources of variability: 1) cell type proportion, 2) perturbation effect, 3) structured experimental variability, and 4) remaining variability. Since each latent space is encouraged to be independent, we simulate perturbation responses by independently composing each latent space to simulate cell-type-specific perturbation responses. We evaluated BuDDI's performance on simulated and real data with experimental designs of increasing complexity. We first validated that BuDDI could learn domain invariant latent spaces on data with matched samples across each source of variability. Then we validated that BuDDI could accurately predict cell-type-specific perturbation response when no single-cell perturbed profiles were used during training; instead, only bulk samples had both perturbed and non-perturbed observations. Finally, we validated BuDDI on predicting sex-specific differences, an experimental design where it is not possible to have matched samples. In each experiment, BuDDI outperformed all other comparative methods and baselines. As more reference atlases are completed, BuDDI provides a path to combine these resources with bulk-profiled treatment or disease signatures to study perturbations, sex differences, or other factors at single-cell resolution.
38008419	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Identifying phenotype-associated subpopulations through LP_SGL.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables the resolution of cellular heterogeneity in diseases and facilitates the identification of novel cell types and subtypes. However, the grouping effects caused by cell-cell interactions are often overlooked in the development of tools for identifying subpopulations. We proposed LP_SGL which incorporates cell group structure to identify phenotype-associated subpopulations by integrating scRNA-seq, bulk expression and bulk phenotype data. Cell groups from scRNA-seq data were obtained by the Leiden algorithm, which facilitates the identification of subpopulations and improves model robustness. LP_SGL identified a higher percentage of cancer cells, T cells and tumor-associated cells than Scissor and scAB on lung adenocarcinoma diagnosis, melanoma drug response and liver cancer survival datasets, respectively. Biological analysis on three original datasets and four independent external validation sets demonstrated that the signaling genes of this cell subset can predict cancer, immunotherapy and survival.
32641298	2020	Genome research	Single-cell analysis of human embryos reveals diverse patterns of aneuploidy and mosaicism.	Less than half of human zygotes survive to birth, primarily due to aneuploidies of meiotic or mitotic origin. Mitotic errors generate chromosomal mosaicism, defined by multiple cell lineages with distinct chromosome complements. The incidence and impacts of mosaicism in human embryos remain controversial, with most previous studies based on bulk DNA assays or comparisons of multiple biopsies of few embryonic cells. Single-cell genomic data provide an opportunity to quantify mosaicism on an embryo-wide scale. To this end, we extended an approach to infer aneuploidies based on dosage-associated changes in gene expression by integrating signatures of allelic imbalance. We applied this method to published single-cell RNA sequencing data from 74 human embryos, spanning the morula to blastocyst stages. Our analysis revealed widespread mosaic aneuploidies, with 59 of 74 (80%) embryos harboring at least one putative aneuploid cell (1% FDR). By clustering copy number calls, we reconstructed histories of chromosome segregation, inferring that 55 (74%) embryos possessed mitotic aneuploidies and 23 (31%) embryos possessed meiotic aneuploidies. We found no significant enrichment of aneuploid cells in the trophectoderm compared to the inner cell mass, although we do detect such enrichment in data from later postimplantation stages. Finally, we observed that aneuploid cells up-regulate immune response genes and down-regulate genes involved in proliferation, metabolism, and protein processing, consistent with stress responses documented in other stages and systems. Together, our work provides a high-resolution view of aneuploidy in preimplantation embryos, and supports the conclusion that low-level mosaicism is a common feature of early human development.
34035046	2021	Genome research	Analysis of alternative polyadenylation from single-cell RNA-seq using scDaPars reveals cell subpopulations invisible to gene expression.	"Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is a major mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation in various cellular processes including cell proliferation and differentiation, but the APA heterogeneity among single cells remains largely unknown. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been extensively used to define cell subpopulations at the transcription level. Yet, most scRNA-seq data have not been analyzed in an ""APA-aware"" manner. Here, we introduce dynamic analysis of APA from single-cell RNA-seq (scDaPars), a bioinformatics algorithm to accurately quantify APA events at both single-cell and single-gene resolution using either 3'-end (10x Chromium) or full-length (Smart-seq2) scRNA-seq data. Validations in both real and simulated data indicate that scDaPars can robustly recover missing APA events caused by the low amounts of mRNA sequenced in single cells. When applied to cancer and human endoderm differentiation data, scDaPars not only revealed cell-type-specific APA regulation but also identified cell subpopulations that are otherwise invisible to conventional gene expression analysis. Thus, scDaPars will enable us to understand cellular heterogeneity at the post-transcriptional APA level."
39985442	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	SCEMENT: scalable and memory efficient integration of large-scale single-cell RNA-sequencing data.	MOTIVATION: Integrative analysis of large-scale single-cell data collected from diverse cell populations promises an improved understanding of complex biological systems. While several algorithms have been developed for single-cell RNA-sequencing data integration, many lack the scalability to handle large numbers of datasets and/or millions of cells due to their memory and run time requirements. The few tools that can handle large data do so by reducing the computational burden through strategies such as subsampling of the data or selecting a reference dataset to improve computational efficiency and scalability. Such shortcuts, however, hamper the accuracy of downstream analyses, especially those requiring quantitative gene expression information. RESULTS: We present SCEMENT, a SCalablE and Memory-Efficient iNTegration method, to overcome these limitations. Our new parallel algorithm builds upon and extends the linear regression model previously applied in ComBat to an unsupervised sparse matrix setting to enable accurate integration of diverse and large collections of single-cell RNA-sequencing data. Using tens to hundreds of real single-cell RNA-seq datasets, we show that SCEMENT outperforms ComBat as well as FastIntegration and Scanorama in runtime (upto 214x faster) and memory usage (upto 17.5x less). It not only performs batch correction and integration of millions of cells in under 25 min, but also facilitates the discovery of new rare cell types and more robust reconstruction of gene regulatory networks with full quantitative gene expression information. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Source code freely available for download at https://github.com/AluruLab/scement, implemented in C++ and supported on Linux.
31764967	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Cerebro: interactive visualization of scRNA-seq data.	Despite the growing availability of sophisticated bioinformatic methods for the analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data, few tools exist that allow biologists without extensive bioinformatic expertise to directly visualize and interact with their own data and results. Here, we present Cerebro (cell report browser), a Shiny- and Electron-based standalone desktop application for macOS and Windows which allows investigation and inspection of pre-processed single-cell transcriptomics data without requiring bioinformatic experience of the user. Through an interactive and intuitive graphical interface, users can (i) explore similarities and heterogeneity between samples and cell clusters in two-dimensional or three-dimensional projections such as t-SNE or UMAP, (ii) display the expression level of single genes or gene sets of interest, (iii) browse tables of most expressed genes and marker genes for each sample and cluster and (iv) display trajectories calculated with Monocle 2. We provide three examples prepared from publicly available datasets to show how Cerebro can be used and which are its capabilities. Through a focus on flexibility and direct access to data and results, we think Cerebro offers a collaborative framework for bioinformaticians and experimental biologists that facilitates effective interaction to shorten the gap between analysis and interpretation of the data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The Cerebro application, additional documentation, and example datasets are available at https://github.com/romanhaa/Cerebro. Similarly, the cerebroApp R package is available at https://github.com/romanhaa/cerebroApp. All components are released under the MIT License.

27048384	2016	Genome biology	The potential of single-cell profiling in plants.	Single-cell transcriptomics has been employed in a growing number of animal studies, but the technique has yet to be widely used in plants. Nonetheless, early studies indicate that single-cell RNA-seq protocols developed for animal cells produce informative datasets in plants. We argue that single-cell transcriptomics has the potential to provide a new perspective on plant problems, such as the nature of the stem cells or initials, the plasticity of plant cells, and the extent of localized cellular responses to environmental inputs. Single-cell experimental outputs require different analytical approaches compared with pooled cell profiles and new tools tailored to single-cell assays are being developed. Here, we highlight promising new single-cell profiling approaches, their limitations as applied to plants, and their potential to address fundamental questions in plant biology.
35101061	2022	Genome biology	Universal prediction of cell-cycle position using transfer learning.	BACKGROUND: The cell cycle is a highly conserved, continuous process which controls faithful replication and division of cells. Single-cell technologies have enabled increasingly precise measurements of the cell cycle both as a biological process of interest and as a possible confounding factor. Despite its importance and conservation, there is no universally applicable approach to infer position in the cell cycle with high-resolution from single-cell RNA-seq data. RESULTS: Here, we present tricycle, an R/Bioconductor package, to address this challenge by leveraging key features of the biology of the cell cycle, the mathematical properties of principal component analysis of periodic functions, and the use of transfer learning. We estimate a cell-cycle embedding using a fixed reference dataset and project new data into this reference embedding, an approach that overcomes key limitations of learning a dataset-dependent embedding. Tricycle then predicts a cell-specific position in the cell cycle based on the data projection. The accuracy of tricycle compares favorably to gold-standard experimental assays, which generally require specialized measurements in specifically constructed in vitro systems. Using internal controls which are available for any dataset, we show that tricycle predictions generalize to datasets with multiple cell types, across tissues, species, and even sequencing assays. CONCLUSIONS: Tricycle generalizes across datasets and is highly scalable and applicable to atlas-level single-cell RNA-seq data.
32762710	2020	Genome biology	"Demystifying ""drop-outs"" in single-cell UMI data."	"Many existing pipelines for scRNA-seq data apply pre-processing steps such as normalization or imputation to account for excessive zeros or ""drop-outs."" Here, we extensively analyze diverse UMI data sets to show that clustering should be the foremost step of the workflow. We observe that most drop-outs disappear once cell-type heterogeneity is resolved, while imputing or normalizing heterogeneous data can introduce unwanted noise. We propose a novel framework HIPPO (Heterogeneity-Inspired Pre-Processing tOol) that leverages zero proportions to explain cellular heterogeneity and integrates feature selection with iterative clustering. HIPPO leads to downstream analysis with greater flexibility and interpretability compared to alternatives."
40889281	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scPOEM: robust co-embedding of peaks and genes revealing peak-gene regulation.	MOTIVATION: Identifying regulatory elements in various chromosomal regions that influence gene expression is a fundamental challenge in epigenomics, with profound implications for understanding gene regulation and disease mechanisms. The advent of paired single-cell RNA sequencing and single-cell ATAC sequencing has created unprecedented opportunities to address this challenge by enabling simultaneous profiling of gene expression and chromatin accessibility at single-cell resolution. However, the inherent signals between them are weak due to the highly sparse and noisy nature of data. RESULTS: This article proposes single-cell meta-Path based Omics Embedding (scPOEM), a novel embedding method that jointly projects chromatin accessibility peaks and expressed genes into a shared low-dimensional space. By integrating the relationships among peak-peak, peak-gene, and gene-gene interactions, scPOEM assigns closer representations in the embedding space to related peak-gene pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that scPOEM generates stable representations of peaks and genes, outperforms existing methods in recovering biologically meaningful peak-gene regulatory relationships and enables new insights in subgroup and differential analysis of gene regulation. These results highlight its potential to uncover gene regulatory mechanisms and enhance the understanding of transcriptional regulation at single-cell resolution. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code of scPOEM is available at https://github.com/Houyt23/scPOEM. The datasets can be obtained from the 10x Genomics (https://www.10xgenomics.com/datasets/pbmc-from-a-healthy-donor-granulocytes-removed-through-cell-sorting-10-k-1-standard-1-0-0) and GEO database under access codes GSE194122 and GSE239916.
32119082	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	V-SVA: an R Shiny application for detecting and annotating hidden sources of variation in single-cell RNA-seq data.	SUMMARY: Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology enables studying gene expression programs from individual cells. However, these data are subject to diverse sources of variation, including 'unwanted' variation that needs to be removed in downstream analyses (e.g. batch effects) and 'wanted' or biological sources of variation (e.g. variation associated with a cell type) that needs to be precisely described. Surrogate variable analysis (SVA)-based algorithms, are commonly used for batch correction and more recently for studying 'wanted' variation in scRNA-seq data. However, interpreting whether these variables are biologically meaningful or stemming from technical reasons remains a challenge. To facilitate the interpretation of surrogate variables detected by algorithms including IA-SVA, SVA or ZINB-WaVE, we developed an R Shiny application [Visual Surrogate Variable Analysis (V-SVA)] that provides a web-browser interface for the identification and annotation of hidden sources of variation in scRNA-seq data. This interactive framework includes tools for discovery of genes associated with detected sources of variation, gene annotation using publicly available databases and gene sets, and data visualization using dimension reduction methods. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The V-SVA Shiny application is publicly hosted at https://vsva.jax.org/ and the source code is freely available at https://github.com/nlawlor/V-SVA.

41269283	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	LogicSR: prior-guided symbolic regression for gene regulatory network inference from single-cell transcriptomics data.	Deciphering gene regulatory mechanisms from high-dimensional biology data remains a central challenge in modern systems biology, despite the growing availability of single-cell datasets. The difficulty stems partly from the sparsity and noise inherent in single-cell data and partly from the complexity of dynamic combinatorial regulation mediated by transcription factors. In this work, we introduce LogicSR, a computational framework that reconstructs gene regulatory networks from single-cell gene expression data with high accuracy by integrating the mechanistic interpretability of Boolean logical models with the equation-discovery capabilities of symbolic regression. It incorporates prior knowledge into a multi-objective Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) framework, leveraging it to ensure biological plausibility and accelerate the search for optimal governing equations. LogicSR outperforms existing methods on both synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets. When applied to a human embryonic stem cell dataset, it demonstrates superior performance in elucidating complex combinatorial TF-target gene regulations and identifying key regulators.
25717193	2015	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Normalization and noise reduction for single cell RNA-seq experiments.	A major roadblock towards accurate interpretation of single cell RNA-seq data is large technical noise resulted from small amount of input materials. The existing methods mainly aim to find differentially expressed genes rather than directly de-noise the single cell data. We present here a powerful but simple method to remove technical noise and explicitly compute the true gene expression levels based on spike-in ERCC molecules.

40579791	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	scTsI: an effective two-stage imputation method for single-cell RNA-seq data.	Single-cell RNA-seq facilitates the understanding of cell types and states and the revealing of the cellular heterogeneity in developmental processes and disease mechanisms. However, the dropout events in single-cell RNA-seq data, in which genes are not detected due to technical noise or limited sequencing depth, seriously affect downstream analyses. Imputation is an effective way to relieve the impact of dropout events. However, the current methods may introduce new noise or modify the high expression values in the imputation process and their performance may be lower than expected when dealing with data with a high dropout rate, facing with different types of data, and aiming at various downstream analyses. We propose a two-stage imputation algorithm, scTsI, for single-cell RNA-seq data. In the first stage, scTsI imputes the zero values using the information of neighboring cells and genes. In the second stage, scTsI transforms the expression matrix into a vector, performs row transformation, and adjusts the imputed values through ridge regression and leveraging bulk RNA-seq data as a constraint. scTsI ensures that the original highly expressed values are unchanged, avoids introducing new noise, and allows sparse matrix input to accelerate imputation. We conduct experiments on a variety of simulated and real data with different dropout rates and compare scTsI with the commonly used imputation methods. The results show that scTsI can restore gene expression and maintain cell-cell similarity across different data dimensions and dropout rates. scTsI can also improve the performance of data visualization, clustering, and cell trajectory inference.

39446193	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Cell cycle expression heterogeneity predicts degree of differentiation.	Methods that predict fate potential or degree of differentiation from transcriptomic data have identified rare progenitor populations and uncovered developmental regulatory mechanisms. However, some state-of-the-art methods are too computationally burdensome for emerging large-scale data and all methods make inaccurate predictions in certain biological systems. We developed a method in R (stemFinder) that predicts single cell differentiation time based on heterogeneity in cell cycle gene expression. Our method is computationally tractable and is as good as or superior to competitors. As part of our benchmarking, we implemented four different performance metrics to assist potential users in selecting the tool that is most apt for their application. Finally, we explore the relationship between differentiation time and cell fate potential by analyzing a lineage tracing dataset with clonally labelled hematopoietic cells, revealing that metrics of differentiation time are correlated with the number of downstream lineages.
38084922	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Clustering malignant cell states using universally variable genes.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revealed important insights into the heterogeneity of malignant cells. However, sample-specific genomic alterations often confound such analysis, resulting in patient-specific clusters that are difficult to interpret. Here, we present a novel approach to address the issue. By normalizing gene expression variances to identify universally variable genes (UVGs), we were able to reduce the formation of sample-specific clusters and identify underlying molecular hallmarks in malignant cells. In contrast to highly variable genes vulnerable to a specific sample bias, UVGs led to better detection of clusters corresponding to distinct malignant cell states. Our results demonstrate the utility of this approach for analyzing scRNA-seq data and suggest avenues for further exploration of malignant cell heterogeneity.
38039139	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	TsImpute: an accurate two-step imputation method for single-cell RNA-seq data.	"MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has enabled discovering gene expression patterns at single cell resolution. However, due to technical limitations, there are usually excessive zeros, called ""dropouts,"" in scRNA-seq data, which may mislead the downstream analysis. Therefore, it is crucial to impute these dropouts to recover the biological information. RESULTS: We propose a two-step imputation method called tsImpute to impute scRNA-seq data. At the first step, tsImpute adopts zero-inflated negative binomial distribution to discriminate dropouts from true zeros and performs initial imputation by calculating the expected expression level. At the second step, it conducts clustering with this modified expression matrix, based on which the final distance weighted imputation is performed. Numerical results based on both simulated and real data show that tsImpute achieves favorable performance in terms of gene expression recovery, cell clustering, and differential expression analysis. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The R package of tsImpute is available at https://github.com/ZhengWeihuaYNU/tsImpute."
41131798	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Scalable inference and identifiability of kinetic parameters for transcriptional bursting from single cell data.	MOTIVATION: Stochastic gene expression and cell-to-cell heterogeneity have attracted increased interest in recent years, enabled by advances in single-cell measurement technologies. These studies are also increasingly complemented by quantitative biophysical modeling, often using the framework of stochastic biochemical kinetic models. However, inferring parameters for such models (i.e., the kinetic rates of biochemical reactions) remains a technical and computational challenge, particularly doing so in a manner that can leverage high-throughput single-cell sequencing data. RESULTS: In this work, we develop a chemical master equation model reference library-based computational pipeline to infer kinetic parameters describing noisy mRNA distributions from single-cell RNA sequencing data, using the commonly applied stochastic telegraph model. The approach fits kinetic parameters via steady-state distributions, as measured across a population of cells in snapshot data. Our pipeline also serves as a tool for comprehensive analysis of parameter identifiability, in both a priori (studying model properties in the absence of data) and a posteriori (in the context of a particular dataset) use-cases. The pipeline can perform both of these tasks, i.e. inference and identifiability analysis, in an efficient and scalable manner, and also serves to disentangle contributions to uncertainty in inferred parameters from experimental noise versus structural properties of the model. We found that for the telegraph model, the majority of the parameter space is not practically identifiable from single-cell RNA sequencing data, and low experimental capture rates worsen the identifiability. Our methodological framework could be extended to other data types in the fitting of small biochemical network models.

38622708	2024	Genome biology	Demuxafy: improvement in droplet assignment by integrating multiple single-cell demultiplexing and doublet detection methods.	Recent innovations in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) provide the technology to investigate biological questions at cellular resolution. Pooling cells from multiple individuals has become a common strategy, and droplets can subsequently be assigned to a specific individual by leveraging their inherent genetic differences. An implicit challenge with scRNA-seq is the occurrence of doublets-droplets containing two or more cells. We develop Demuxafy, a framework to enhance donor assignment and doublet removal through the consensus intersection of multiple demultiplexing and doublet detecting methods. Demuxafy significantly improves droplet assignment by separating singlets from doublets and classifying the correct individual.
34009297	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	powerEQTL: an R package and shiny application for sample size and power calculation of bulk tissue and single-cell eQTL analysis.	SUMMARY: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed thousands of genetic loci for common diseases. One of the main challenges in the post-GWAS era is to understand the causality of the genetic variants. Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis is an effective way to address this question by examining the relationship between gene expression and genetic variation in a sufficiently powered cohort. However, it is frequently a challenge to determine the sample size at which a variant with a specific allele frequency will be detected to associate with gene expression with sufficient power. This is a particularly difficult task for single-cell RNAseq studies. Therefore, a user-friendly tool to estimate statistical power for eQTL analyses in both bulk tissue and single-cell data is needed. Here, we presented an R package called powerEQTL with flexible functions to estimate power, minimal sample size or detectable minor allele frequency for both bulk tissue and single-cell eQTL analysis. A user-friendly, program-free web application is also provided, allowing users to calculate and visualize the parameters interactively. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The powerEQTL R package source code and online tutorial are freely available at CRAN: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/powerEQTL/.

38739758	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Single-cell RNA-seq data analysis reveals functionally relevant biomarkers of early brain development and their regulatory footprints in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs).	The complicated process of neuronal development is initiated early in life, with the genetic mechanisms governing this process yet to be fully elucidated. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a potent instrument for pinpointing biomarkers that exhibit differential expression across various cell types and developmental stages. By employing scRNA-seq on human embryonic stem cells, we aim to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) crucial for early-stage neuronal development. Our focus extends beyond simply identifying DEGs. We strive to investigate the functional roles of these genes through enrichment analysis and construct gene regulatory networks to understand their interactions. Ultimately, this comprehensive approach aspires to illuminate the molecular mechanisms and transcriptional dynamics governing early human brain development. By uncovering potential links between these DEGs and intelligence, mental disorders, and neurodevelopmental disorders, we hope to shed light on human neurological health and disease. In this study, we have used scRNA-seq to identify DEGs involved in early-stage neuronal development in hESCs. The scRNA-seq data, collected on days 26 (D26) and 54 (D54), of the in vitro differentiation of hESCs to neurons were analyzed. Our analysis identified 539 DEGs between D26 and D54. Functional enrichment of those DEG biomarkers indicated that the up-regulated DEGs participated in neurogenesis, while the down-regulated DEGs were linked to synapse regulation. The Reactome pathway analysis revealed that down-regulated DEGs were involved in the interactions between proteins located in synapse pathways. We also discovered interactions between DEGs and miRNA, transcriptional factors (TFs) and DEGs, and between TF and miRNA. Our study identified 20 significant transcription factors, shedding light on early brain development genetics. The identified DEGs and gene regulatory networks are valuable resources for future research into human brain development and neurodevelopmental disorders.
35042723	2022	Genome research	Characterization of transcript enrichment and detection bias in single-nucleus RNA-seq for mapping of distinct human adipocyte lineages.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables molecular characterization of complex biological tissues at high resolution. The requirement of single-cell extraction, however, makes it challenging for profiling tissues such as adipose tissue, for which collection of intact single adipocytes is complicated by their fragile nature. For such tissues, single-nucleus extraction is often much more efficient and therefore single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) presents an alternative to scRNA-seq. However, nuclear transcripts represent only a fraction of the transcriptome in a single cell, with snRNA-seq marked with inherent transcript enrichment and detection biases. Therefore, snRNA-seq may be inadequate for mapping important transcriptional signatures in adipose tissue. In this study, we compare the transcriptomic landscape of single nuclei isolated from preadipocytes and mature adipocytes across human white and brown adipocyte lineages, with whole-cell transcriptome. We show that snRNA-seq is capable of identifying the broad cell types present in scRNA-seq at all states of adipogenesis. However, we also explore how and why the nuclear transcriptome is biased and limited, as well as how it can be advantageous. We robustly characterize the enrichment of nuclear-localized transcripts and adipogenic regulatory lncRNAs in snRNA-seq, while also providing a detailed understanding for the preferential detection of long genes upon using this technique. To remove such technical detection biases, we propose a normalization strategy for a more accurate comparison of nuclear and cellular data. Finally, we show successful integration of scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq data sets with existing bioinformatic tools. Overall, our results illustrate the applicability of snRNA-seq for the characterization of cellular diversity in the adipose tissue.
36692140	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	BLTSA: pseudotime prediction for single cells by branched local tangent space alignment.	MOTIVATION: The development of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology makes it possible to study the cellular dynamic processes such as cell cycle and cell differentiation. Due to the difficulties in generating genuine time-series scRNA-seq data, it is of great importance to computationally infer the pseudotime of the cells along differentiation trajectory based on their gene expression patterns. The existing pseudotime prediction methods often suffer from the high level noise of single-cell data, thus it is still necessary to study the single-cell trajectory inference methods. RESULTS: In this study, we propose a branched local tangent space alignment (BLTSA) method to infer single-cell pseudotime for multi-furcation trajectories. By assuming that single cells are sampled from a low-dimensional self-intersecting manifold, BLTSA first identifies the tip and branching cells in the trajectory based on cells' local Euclidean neighborhoods. Local coordinates within the tangent spaces are then determined by each cell's local neighborhood after clustering all the cells to different branches iteratively. The global coordinates for all the single cells are finally obtained by aligning the local coordinates based on the tangent spaces. We evaluate the performance of BLTSA on four simulation datasets and five real datasets. The experimental results show that BLTSA has obvious advantages over other comparison methods. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: R codes are available at https://github.com/LiminLi-xjtu/BLTSA. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
39470718	2025	Nucleic acids research	ncPlantDB: a plant ncRNA database with potential ncPEP information and cell type-specific interaction.	The field of plant non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) has seen significant advancements in recent years, with many ncRNAs recognized as important regulators of gene expression during plant development and stress responses. Moreover, the coding potential of these ncRNAs, giving rise to ncRNA-encoded peptides (ncPEPs), has emerged as an essential area of study. However, existing plant ncRNA databases lack comprehensive information on ncRNA-encoded peptides (ncPEPs) and cell type-specific interactions. To address this gap, we present ncPlantDB (https://bis.zju.edu.cn/ncPlantDB), a comprehensive database integrating ncRNA and ncPEP data across 43 plant species. ncPlantDB encompasses 353 140 ncRNAs, 3799 ncPEPs and 4 647 071 interactions, sourced from established databases and literature mining. The database offers unique features including translational potential data, cell-specific interaction networks derived from single-cell RNA sequencing and Ribo-seq analyses, and interactive visualization tools. ncPlantDB provides a user-friendly interface for exploring ncRNA expression patterns at the single-cell level, facilitating the discovery of tissue-specific ncRNAs and potential ncPEPs. By integrating diverse data types and offering advanced analytical tools, ncPlantDB serves as a valuable resource for researchers investigating plant ncRNA functions, interactions, and their potential coding capacity. This database significantly enhances our understanding of plant ncRNA biology and opens new avenues for exploring the complex regulatory networks in plant genomics.
32657402	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	BIRD: identifying cell doublets via biallelic expression from single cells.	SUMMARY: Current technologies for single-cell transcriptomics allow thousands of cells to be analyzed in a single experiment. The increased scale of these methods raises the risk of cell doublets contamination. Available tools and algorithms for identifying doublets and estimating their occurrence in single-cell experimental data focus on doublets of different species, cell types or individuals. In this study, we analyze transcriptomic data from single cells having an identical genetic background. We claim that the ratio of monoallelic to biallelic expression provides a discriminating power toward doublets' identification. We present a pipeline called BIallelic Ratio for Doublets (BIRD) that relies on heterologous genetic variations, from single-cell RNA sequencing. For each dataset, doublets were artificially created from the actual data and used to train a predictive model. BIRD was applied on Smart-seq data from 163 primary fibroblast single cells. The model achieved 100% accuracy in annotating the randomly simulated doublets. Bonafide doublets were verified based on a biallelic expression signal amongst X-chromosome of female fibroblasts. Data from 10X Genomics microfluidics of human peripheral blood cells achieved in average 83% (+/-3.7%) accuracy, and an area under the curve of 0.88 (+/-0.04) for a collection of  approximately 13 300 single cells. BIRD addresses instances of doublets, which were formed from cell mixtures of identical genetic background and cell identity. Maximal performance is achieved for high-coverage data from Smart-seq. Success in identifying doublets is data specific which varies according to the experimental methodology, genomic diversity between haplotypes, sequence coverage and depth.

34412669	2021	Genome biology	MultiK: an automated tool to determine optimal cluster numbers in single-cell RNA sequencing data.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides new opportunities to characterize cell populations, typically accomplished through some type of clustering analysis. Estimation of the optimal cluster number (K) is a crucial step but often ignored. Our approach improves most current scRNA-seq cluster methods by providing an objective estimation of the number of groups using a multi-resolution perspective. MultiK is a tool for objective selection of insightful Ks and achieves high robustness through a consensus clustering approach. We demonstrate that MultiK identifies reproducible groups in scRNA-seq data, thus providing an objective means to estimating the number of possible groups or cell-type populations present.
27782827	2016	Genome biology	A statistical approach for identifying differential distributions in single-cell RNA-seq experiments.	The ability to quantify cellular heterogeneity is a major advantage of single-cell technologies. However, statistical methods often treat cellular heterogeneity as a nuisance. We present a novel method to characterize differences in expression in the presence of distinct expression states within and among biological conditions. We demonstrate that this framework can detect differential expression patterns under a wide range of settings. Compared to existing approaches, this method has higher power to detect subtle differences in gene expression distributions that are more complex than a mean shift, and can characterize those differences. The freely available R package scDD implements the approach.
36624504	2023	Genome biology	Single-cell transcriptomics unveils xylem cell development and evolution.	BACKGROUND: Xylem, the most abundant tissue on Earth, is responsible for lateral growth in plants. Typical xylem has a radial system composed of ray parenchyma cells and an axial system of fusiform cells. In most angiosperms, fusiform cells comprise vessel elements for water transportation and libriform fibers for mechanical support, while both functions are performed by tracheids in other vascular plants such as gymnosperms. Little is known about the developmental programs and evolutionary relationships of these xylem cell types. RESULTS: Through both single-cell and laser capture microdissection transcriptomic profiling, we determine the developmental lineages of ray and fusiform cells in stem-differentiating xylem across four divergent woody angiosperms. Based on cross-species analyses of single-cell clusters and overlapping trajectories, we reveal highly conserved ray, yet variable fusiform, lineages across angiosperms. Core eudicots Populus trichocarpa and Eucalyptus grandis share nearly identical fusiform lineages, whereas the more basal angiosperm Liriodendron chinense has a fusiform lineage distinct from that in core eudicots. The tracheids in the basal eudicot Trochodendron aralioides, an evolutionarily reversed trait, exhibit strong transcriptomic similarity to vessel elements rather than libriform fibers. CONCLUSIONS: This evo-devo framework provides a comprehensive understanding of the formation of xylem cell lineages across multiple plant species spanning over a hundred million years of evolutionary history.
21543516	2011	Genome research	Characterization of the single-cell transcriptional landscape by highly multiplex RNA-seq.	Our understanding of the development and maintenance of tissues has been greatly aided by large-scale gene expression analysis. However, tissues are invariably complex, and expression analysis of a tissue confounds the true expression patterns of its constituent cell types. Here we describe a novel strategy to access such complex samples. Single-cell RNA-seq expression profiles were generated, and clustered to form a two-dimensional cell map onto which expression data were projected. The resulting cell map integrates three levels of organization: the whole population of cells, the functionally distinct subpopulations it contains, and the single cells themselves-all without need for known markers to classify cell types. The feasibility of the strategy was demonstrated by analyzing the transcriptomes of 85 single cells of two distinct types. We believe this strategy will enable the unbiased discovery and analysis of naturally occurring cell types during development, adult physiology, and disease.
40753537	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Approaching the holistic transcriptome-convolution and deconvolution in transcriptomics.	"Tissues, organs, and entire organisms are composed of diverse cell populations, which are characterized by cell-type-specific gene activities. Bulk RNA-seq represents a robust, cost-effective, scalable method to measure gene activity at the bulk tissue level. However, pathomolecular processes lead to divergent changes in tissue composition and cell-type-specific gene deregulations, which cannot be resolved at the tissue bulk level without information on either change in cell-type proportion or expression at the single-cell level. Accordingly, methods have been developed that constrain bulk deconvolution by information from single-cell expression or cell-type proportion. In parallel, convolution methods have been developed to project single-cell expression to bulk tissue level (pseudobulk simulation). In the present review, we provide an overview of existing convolution and deconvolution methods, their interconnectivity, and benchmarking. Our unique approach lies in the joint consideration of both directions in a ""holistic transcriptome model."" Through analysis of published (de)convolution studies and benchmarks, we identified the reduced availability of suitable datasets and the use of inaccurate convolution-like methods for (de)convolution model assessment and training as key bottlenecks in the field. On that basis, we conclude with a holistic transcriptome model envisioning that a more integral approach to convolution and deconvolution is needed. With our suggestions for a unified framework we aim to spark collaborative efforts to enable major leaps forward in the field of (de)convolution."
37523217	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	scDeepInsight: a supervised cell-type identification method for scRNA-seq data with deep learning.	Annotation of cell-types is a critical step in the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data that allows the study of heterogeneity across multiple cell populations. Currently, this is most commonly done using unsupervised clustering algorithms, which project single-cell expression data into a lower dimensional space and then cluster cells based on their distances from each other. However, as these methods do not use reference datasets, they can only achieve a rough classification of cell-types, and it is difficult to improve the recognition accuracy further. To effectively solve this issue, we propose a novel supervised annotation method, scDeepInsight. The scDeepInsight method is capable of performing manifold assignments. It is competent in executing data integration through batch normalization, performing supervised training on the reference dataset, doing outlier detection and annotating cell-types on query datasets. Moreover, it can help identify active genes or marker genes related to cell-types. The training of the scDeepInsight model is performed in a unique way. Tabular scRNA-seq data are first converted to corresponding images through the DeepInsight methodology. DeepInsight can create a trainable image transformer to convert non-image RNA data to images by comprehensively comparing interrelationships among multiple genes. Subsequently, the converted images are fed into convolutional neural networks such as EfficientNet-b3. This enables automatic feature extraction to identify the cell-types of scRNA-seq samples. We benchmarked scDeepInsight with six other mainstream cell annotation methods. The average accuracy rate of scDeepInsight reached 87.5%, which is more than 7% higher compared with the state-of-the-art methods.
34469510	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Differential transcript usage analysis of bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data with DTUrtle.	MOTIVATION: Each year, the number of published bulk and single-cell RNA-seq datasets is growing exponentially. Studies analyzing such data are commonly looking at gene-level differences, while the collected RNA-seq data inherently represents reads of transcript isoform sequences. Utilizing transcriptomic quantifiers, RNA-seq reads can be attributed to specific isoforms, allowing for analysis of transcript-level differences. A differential transcript usage (DTU) analysis is testing for proportional differences in a gene's transcript composition, and has been of rising interest for many research questions, such as analysis of differential splicing or cell-type identification. RESULTS: We present the R package DTUrtle, the first DTU analysis workflow for both bulk and single-cell RNA-seq datasets, and the first package to conduct a 'classical' DTU analysis in a single-cell context. DTUrtle extends established statistical frameworks, offers various result aggregation and visualization options and a novel detection probability score for tagged-end data. It has been successfully applied to bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data of human and mouse, confirming and extending key results. In addition, we present novel potential DTU applications like the identification of cell-type specific transcript isoforms as biomarkers. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The R package DTUrtle is available at https://github.com/TobiTekath/DTUrtle with extensive vignettes and documentation at https://tobitekath.github.io/DTUrtle/.

29771290	2018	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Single cell clustering based on cell-pair differentiability correlation and variance analysis.	MOTIVATION: The rapid advancement of single cell technologies has shed new light on the complex mechanisms of cellular heterogeneity. Identification of intercellular transcriptomic heterogeneity is one of the most critical tasks in single-cell RNA-sequencing studies. RESULTS: We propose a new cell similarity measure based on cell-pair differentiability correlation, which is derived from gene differential pattern among all cell pairs. Through plugging into the framework of hierarchical clustering with this new measure, we further develop a variance analysis based clustering algorithm 'Corr' that can determine cluster number automatically and identify cell types accurately. The robustness and superiority of the proposed algorithm are compared with representative algorithms: shared nearest neighbor (SNN)-Cliq and several other state-of-the-art clustering methods, on many benchmark or real single cell RNA-sequencing datasets in terms of both internal criteria (clustering number and accuracy) and external criteria (purity, adjusted rand index, F1-measure). Moreover, differentiability vector with our new measure provides a new means in identifying potential biomarkers from cancer related single cell datasets even with strong noise. Prognosis analyses from independent datasets of cancers confirmed the effectiveness of our 'Corr' method.

38806165	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Impeller: a path-based heterogeneous graph learning method for spatial transcriptomic data imputation.	MOTIVATION: Recent advances in spatial transcriptomics allow spatially resolved gene expression measurements with cellular or even sub-cellular resolution, directly characterizing the complex spatiotemporal gene expression landscape and cell-to-cell interactions in their native microenvironments. Due to technology limitations, most spatial transcriptomic technologies still yield incomplete expression measurements with excessive missing values. Therefore, gene imputation is critical to filling in missing data, enhancing resolution, and improving overall interpretability. However, existing methods either require additional matched single-cell RNA-seq data, which is rarely available, or ignore spatial proximity or expression similarity information. RESULTS: To address these issues, we introduce Impeller, a path-based heterogeneous graph learning method for spatial transcriptomic data imputation. Impeller has two unique characteristics distinct from existing approaches. First, it builds a heterogeneous graph with two types of edges representing spatial proximity and expression similarity. Therefore, Impeller can simultaneously model smooth gene expression changes across spatial dimensions and capture similar gene expression signatures of faraway cells from the same type. Moreover, Impeller incorporates both short- and long-range cell-to-cell interactions (e.g. via paracrine and endocrine) by stacking multiple GNN layers. We use a learnable path operator in Impeller to avoid the over-smoothing issue of the traditional Laplacian matrices. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets from three popular platforms and two species demonstrate the superiority of Impeller over various state-of-the-art imputation methods. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The code and preprocessed data used in this study are available at https://github.com/aicb-ZhangLabs/Impeller and https://zenodo.org/records/11212604.
39715686	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	CPARI: a novel approach combining cell partitioning with absolute and relative imputation to address dropout in single-cell RNA-seq data.	"A key challenge in analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing data is the large number of false zeros, known as ""dropout zeros"", which are caused by technical limitations such as shallow sequencing depth or inefficient mRNA capture. To address this challenge, we propose a novel imputation model called CPARI, which combines cell partitioning with our designed absolute and relative imputation methods. Initially, CPARI employs a new approach to select highly variable genes and constructs an average consensus matrix using C-mean fuzzy clustering-based blockchain technology to obtain results at different resolutions. Hierarchical clustering is then applied to further refine these blocks, resulting in well-defined cellular partitions. Subsequently, CPARI identifies dropout events and determines the imputation positions of these identified zeros. An autoencoder is trained within each cellular block to learn gene features and reconstruct data. Our uniquely defined absolute imputation technique is first applied to the identified positions, followed by our relative imputation technique to address remaining dropout zeros, ensuring that both global consistency and local variation are maintained. Through comprehensive analyses conducted on simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets, including quantitative assessment, differential expression analysis, cell clustering, cell trajectory inference, robustness evaluation, and large-scale data imputation, CPARI demonstrates superior performance compared to 12 other art-of-state imputation models. Additionally, ablation experiments further confirm the significance and necessity of both the cell partitioning and relative imputation components of CPARI. Notably, CPARI as a new denoising approach could distinguish between real biological zeros and dropout zeros and minimize false positives, and maximize the accuracy of imputation."
27998929	2017	Nucleic acids research	SLICE: determining cell differentiation and lineage based on single cell entropy.	A complex organ contains a variety of cell types, each with its own distinct lineage and function. Understanding the lineage and differentiation state of each cell is fundamentally important for the ultimate delineation of organ formation and function. We developed SLICE, a novel algorithm that utilizes single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) to quantitatively measure cellular differentiation states based on single cell entropy and predict cell differentiation lineages via the construction of entropy directed cell trajectories. We validated our approach using three independent data sets with known lineage and developmental time information from both Homo sapiens and Mus musculus. SLICE successfully measured the differentiation states of single cells and reconstructed cell differentiation trajectories that have been previously experimentally validated. We then applied SLICE to scRNA-seq of embryonic mouse lung at E16.5 to identify lung mesenchymal cell lineage relationships that currently remain poorly defined. A two-branched differentiation pathway of five fibroblastic subtypes was predicted using SLICE. The present study demonstrated the general applicability and high predictive accuracy of SLICE in determining cellular differentiation states and reconstructing cell differentiation lineages in scRNA-seq analysis.
35980155	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Omnibus and robust deconvolution scheme for bulk RNA sequencing data integrating multiple single-cell reference sets and prior biological knowledge.	MOTIVATION: Cell-type deconvolution of bulk tissue RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data is an important step toward understanding the variations in cell-type composition among disease conditions. Owing to recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and the availability of large amounts of bulk RNA-seq data in disease-relevant tissues, various deconvolution methods have been developed. However, the performance of existing methods heavily relies on the quality of information provided by external data sources, such as the selection of scRNA-seq data as a reference and prior biological information. RESULTS: We present the Integrated and Robust Deconvolution (InteRD) algorithm to infer cell-type proportions from target bulk RNA-seq data. Owing to the innovative use of penalized regression with a new evaluation criterion for deconvolution, InteRD has three primary advantages. First, it is able to effectively integrate deconvolution results from multiple scRNA-seq datasets. Second, InteRD calibrates estimates from reference-based deconvolution by taking into account extra biological information as priors. Third, the proposed algorithm is robust to inaccurate external information imposed in the deconvolution system. Extensive numerical evaluations and real-data applications demonstrate that InteRD yields more accurate and robust cell-type proportion estimates that agree well with known biology. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The proposed InteRD framework is implemented in R and the package is available at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/InteRD/index.html. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
39110511	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Accelerated dimensionality reduction of single-cell RNA sequencing data with fastglmpca.	"SUMMARY: Motivated by theoretical and practical issues that arise when applying Principal component analysis (PCA) to count data, Townes et al. introduced ""Poisson GLM-PCA"", a variation of PCA adapted to count data, as a tool for dimensionality reduction of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. However, fitting GLM-PCA is computationally challenging. Here we study this problem, and show that a simple algorithm, which we call ""Alternating Poisson Regression"" (APR), produces better quality fits, and in less time, than existing algorithms. APR is also memory-efficient and lends itself to parallel implementation on multi-core processors, both of which are helpful for handling large scRNA-seq datasets. We illustrate the benefits of this approach in three publicly available scRNA-seq datasets. The new algorithms are implemented in an R package, fastglmpca. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The fastglmpca R package is released on CRAN for Windows, macOS and Linux, and the source code is available at github.com/stephenslab/fastglmpca under the open source GPL-3 license. Scripts to reproduce the results in this paper are also available in the GitHub repository and on Zenodo."
28099430	2017	Nature methods	Pooled CRISPR screening with single-cell transcriptome readout.	CRISPR-based genetic screens are accelerating biological discovery, but current methods have inherent limitations. Widely used pooled screens are restricted to simple readouts including cell proliferation and sortable marker proteins. Arrayed screens allow for comprehensive molecular readouts such as transcriptome profiling, but at much lower throughput. Here we combine pooled CRISPR screening with single-cell RNA sequencing into a broadly applicable workflow, directly linking guide RNA expression to transcriptome responses in thousands of individual cells. Our method for CRISPR droplet sequencing (CROP-seq) enables pooled CRISPR screens with single-cell transcriptome resolution, which will facilitate high-throughput functional dissection of complex regulatory mechanisms and heterogeneous cell populations.
34871454	2022	Nucleic acids research	Effective and scalable single-cell data alignment with non-linear canonical correlation analysis.	Data alignment is one of the first key steps in single cell analysis for integrating multiple datasets and performing joint analysis across studies. Data alignment is challenging in extremely large datasets, however, as the major of the current single cell data alignment methods are not computationally efficient. Here, we present VIPCCA, a computational framework based on non-linear canonical correlation analysis for effective and scalable single cell data alignment. VIPCCA leverages both deep learning for effective single cell data modeling and variational inference for scalable computation, thus enabling powerful data alignment across multiple samples, multiple data platforms, and multiple data types. VIPCCA is accurate for a range of alignment tasks including alignment between single cell RNAseq and ATACseq datasets and can easily accommodate millions of cells, thereby providing researchers unique opportunities to tackle challenges emerging from large-scale single-cell atlas.
37379341	2023	PLoS computational biology	Cell-type annotation with accurate unseen cell-type identification using multiple references.	The recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) techniques have stimulated efforts to identify and characterize the cellular composition of complex tissues. With the advent of various sequencing techniques, automated cell-type annotation using a well-annotated scRNA-seq reference becomes popular. But it relies on the diversity of cell types in the reference, which may not capture all the cell types present in the query data of interest. There are generally unseen cell types in the query data of interest because most data atlases are obtained for different purposes and techniques. Identifying previously unseen cell types is essential for improving annotation accuracy and uncovering novel biological discoveries. To address this challenge, we propose mtANN (multiple-reference-based scRNA-seq data annotation), a new method to automatically annotate query data while accurately identifying unseen cell types with the aid of multiple references. Key innovations of mtANN include the integration of deep learning and ensemble learning to improve prediction accuracy, and the introduction of a new metric that considers three complementary aspects to distinguish between unseen cell types and shared cell types. Additionally, we provide a data-driven method to adaptively select a threshold for identifying previously unseen cell types. We demonstrate the advantages of mtANN over state-of-the-art methods for unseen cell-type identification and cell-type annotation on two benchmark dataset collections, as well as its predictive power on a collection of COVID-19 datasets. The source code and tutorial are available at https://github.com/Zhangxf-ccnu/mtANN.
38960404	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Comprehensive single-cell RNA-seq analysis using deep interpretable generative modeling guided by biological hierarchy knowledge.	Recent advances in microfluidics and sequencing technologies allow researchers to explore cellular heterogeneity at single-cell resolution. In recent years, deep learning frameworks, such as generative models, have brought great changes to the analysis of transcriptomic data. Nevertheless, relying on the potential space of these generative models alone is insufficient to generate biological explanations. In addition, most of the previous work based on generative models is limited to shallow neural networks with one to three layers of latent variables, which may limit the capabilities of the models. Here, we propose a deep interpretable generative model called d-scIGM for single-cell data analysis. d-scIGM combines sawtooth connectivity techniques and residual networks, thereby constructing a deep generative framework. In addition, d-scIGM incorporates hierarchical prior knowledge of biological domains to enhance the interpretability of the model. We show that d-scIGM achieves excellent performance in a variety of fundamental tasks, including clustering, visualization, and pseudo-temporal inference. Through topic pathway studies, we found that d-scIGM-learned topics are better enriched for biologically meaningful pathways compared to the baseline models. Furthermore, the analysis of drug response data shows that d-scIGM can capture drug response patterns in large-scale experiments, which provides a promising way to elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms. Lastly, in the melanoma dataset, d-scIGM accurately identified different cell types and revealed multiple melanin-related driver genes and key pathways, which are critical for understanding disease mechanisms and drug development.
35238346	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Phitest for analyzing the homogeneity of single-cell populations.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing technologies facilitate the characterization of transcriptomic landscapes in diverse species, tissues and cell types with unprecedented molecular resolution. In order to better understand animal development, physiology, and pathology, unsupervised clustering analysis is often used to identify relevant cell populations. Although considerable progress has been made in terms of clustering algorithms in recent years, it remains challenging to evaluate the quality of the inferred single-cell clusters, which can greatly impact downstream analysis and interpretation. RESULTS: We propose a bioinformatics tool named Phitest to analyze the homogeneity of single-cell populations. Phitest is able to distinguish between homogeneous and heterogeneous cell populations, providing an objective and automatic method to optimize the performance of single-cell clustering analysis. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The PhitestR package is freely available on both Github (https://github.com/Vivianstats/PhitestR) and the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). There is no new genomic data associated with this article. Published data used in the analysis are described in detail in the Supplementary Data.

39142810	2024	Genome research	A spatiotemporally resolved atlas of mRNA decay in the C. elegans embryo reveals differential regulation of mRNA stability across stages and cell types.	During embryonic development, cells undergo dynamic changes in gene expression that are required for appropriate cell fate specification. Although both transcription and mRNA degradation contribute to gene expression dynamics, patterns of mRNA decay are less well understood. Here, we directly measure spatiotemporally resolved mRNA decay rates transcriptome-wide throughout C. elegans embryogenesis by transcription inhibition followed by bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing. This allows us to calculate mRNA half-lives within specific cell types and developmental stages, and identify differentially regulated mRNA decay throughout embryonic development. We identify transcript features that are correlated with mRNA stability and find that mRNA decay rates are associated with distinct peaks in gene expression over time. Moreover, we provide evidence that, on average, mRNA is more stable in the germline than in the soma and in later embryonic stages than in earlier stages. This work suggests that differential mRNA decay across cell states and time helps to shape developmental gene expression, and it provides a valuable resource for studies of mRNA turnover regulatory mechanisms.
27307648	2016	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Analysis of aggregated cell-cell statistical distances within pathways unveils therapeutic-resistance mechanisms in circulating tumor cells.	MOTIVATION: As 'omics' biotechnologies accelerate the capability to contrast a myriad of molecular measurements from a single cell, they also exacerbate current analytical limitations for detecting meaningful single-cell dysregulations. Moreover, mRNA expression alone lacks functional interpretation, limiting opportunities for translation of single-cell transcriptomic insights to precision medicine. Lastly, most single-cell RNA-sequencing analytic approaches are not designed to investigate small populations of cells such as circulating tumor cells shed from solid tumors and isolated from patient blood samples. RESULTS: In response to these characteristics and limitations in current single-cell RNA-sequencing methodology, we introduce an analytic framework that models transcriptome dynamics through the analysis of aggregated cell-cell statistical distances within biomolecular pathways. Cell-cell statistical distances are calculated from pathway mRNA fold changes between two cells. Within an elaborate case study of circulating tumor cells derived from prostate cancer patients, we develop analytic methods of aggregated distances to identify five differentially expressed pathways associated to therapeutic resistance. Our aggregation analyses perform comparably with Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and better than differentially expressed genes followed by gene set enrichment. However, these methods were not designed to inform on differential pathway expression for a single cell. As such, our framework culminates with the novel aggregation method, cell-centric statistics (CCS). CCS quantifies the effect size and significance of differentially expressed pathways for a single cell of interest. Improved rose plots of differentially expressed pathways in each cell highlight the utility of CCS for therapeutic decision-making.

40794951	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Prioritizing pathway signature using deep learning approach: a novel strategy for traditional Chinese medicine formula generation and optimization.	The advancement of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) faces challenges, due to the absence of a deep understanding of TCM mechanism at the perspective of modern biomedical practices. This results in how TCM selects herbs to treat diseases or symptoms prevailingly rely on clinicals' experience or TCM ancient books, at least in part lacking scientific basis. Herein, we present a novel deep learning-based approach, named Negative-Correlation-based TCM Architecture for Reversal (NeCTAR), to optimize the generation and combination of TCM formulas for guiding empiric therapy, by which we could, to some degree, narrow the gap between TCM and modern biomedical science. Our approach builds on a hypothesis that pathway alterations may serve as a proxy for the corresponding physiological changes induced by a certain disease, and 'inverse-fit' those alterations would provide a feasible therapeutic strategy to treat the disease. We leveraged ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNA-seq) data with Gene Set Enrichment Analysis to establish herb-pathway associations, integrating these insights into a multilayer perceptron model that incorporates top-k sparse projection and pathway reconstruction loss to predict the most therapeutically promising herbal components. NeCTAR demonstrated high concordance with experimental data across various disease models, including fatty liver disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and premature ovarian failure. Notably, NeCTAR could equally apply to single cell RNA-seq data. Overall, our study put forwards a novel interpretive framework underlying TCM mechanisms using modern biomedical foundation, by which we could prioritize herbal components based on existing TCM formulas treating diseases.
25722368	2015	Nucleic acids research	SC3-seq: a method for highly parallel and quantitative measurement of single-cell gene expression.	Single-cell mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) methods have undergone rapid development in recent years, and transcriptome analysis of relevant cell populations at single-cell resolution has become a key research area of biomedical sciences. We here present single-cell mRNA 3-prime end sequencing (SC3-seq), a practical methodology based on PCR amplification followed by 3-prime-end enrichment for highly quantitative, parallel and cost-effective measurement of gene expression in single cells. The SC3-seq allows excellent quantitative measurement of mRNAs ranging from the 10,000-cell to 1-cell level, and accordingly, allows an accurate estimate of the transcript levels by a regression of the read counts of spike-in RNAs with defined copy numbers. The SC3-seq has clear advantages over other typical single-cell RNA-seq methodologies for the quantitative measurement of transcript levels and at a sequence depth required for the saturation of transcript detection. The SC3-seq distinguishes four distinct cell types in the peri-implantation mouse blastocysts. Furthermore, the SC3-seq reveals the heterogeneity in human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) cultured under on-feeder as well as feeder-free conditions, demonstrating a more homogeneous property of the feeder-free hiPSCs. We propose that SC3-seq might be used as a powerful strategy for single-cell transcriptome analysis in a broad range of investigations in biomedical sciences.
37233193	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Deep single-cell RNA-seq data clustering with graph prototypical contrastive learning.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing enables researchers to study cellular heterogeneity at single-cell level. To this end, identifying cell types of cells with clustering techniques becomes an important task for downstream analysis. However, challenges of scRNA-seq data such as pervasive dropout phenomena hinder obtaining robust clustering outputs. Although existing studies try to alleviate these problems, they fall short of fully leveraging the relationship information and mainly rely on reconstruction-based losses that highly depend on the data quality, which is sometimes noisy. RESULTS: This work proposes a graph-based prototypical contrastive learning method, named scGPCL. Specifically, scGPCL encodes the cell representations using Graph Neural Networks on cell-gene graph that captures the relational information inherent in scRNA-seq data and introduces prototypical contrastive learning to learn cell representations by pushing apart semantically dissimilar pairs and pulling together similar ones. Through extensive experiments on both simulated and real scRNA-seq data, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of scGPCL. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Code is available at https://github.com/Junseok0207/scGPCL.
37930022	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	COMO: a pipeline for multi-omics data integration in metabolic modeling and drug discovery.	Identifying potential drug targets using metabolic modeling requires integrating multiple modeling methods and heterogeneous biological datasets, which can be challenging without efficient tools. We developed Constraint-based Optimization of Metabolic Objectives (COMO), a user-friendly pipeline that integrates multi-omics data processing, context-specific metabolic model development, simulations, drug databases and disease data to aid drug discovery. COMO can be installed as a Docker Image or with Conda and includes intuitive instructions within a Jupyter Lab environment. It provides a comprehensive solution for the integration of bulk and single-cell RNA-seq, microarrays and proteomics outputs to develop context-specific metabolic models. Using public databases, open-source solutions for model construction and a streamlined approach for predicting repurposable drugs, COMO enables researchers to investigate low-cost alternatives and novel disease treatments. As a case study, we used the pipeline to construct metabolic models of B cells, which simulate and analyze them to predict metabolic drug targets for rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, respectively. COMO can be used to construct models for any cell or tissue type and identify drugs for any human disease where metabolic inhibition is relevant. The pipeline has the potential to improve the health of the global community cost-effectively by providing high-confidence targets to pursue in preclinical and clinical studies. The source code of the COMO pipeline is available at https://github.com/HelikarLab/COMO. The Docker image can be pulled at https://github.com/HelikarLab/COMO/pkgs/container/como.
29227470	2018	Nature biotechnology	Multiplexed droplet single-cell RNA-sequencing using natural genetic variation.	Droplet single-cell RNA-sequencing (dscRNA-seq) has enabled rapid, massively parallel profiling of transcriptomes. However, assessing differential expression across multiple individuals has been hampered by inefficient sample processing and technical batch effects. Here we describe a computational tool, demuxlet, that harnesses natural genetic variation to determine the sample identity of each droplet containing a single cell (singlet) and detect droplets containing two cells (doublets). These capabilities enable multiplexed dscRNA-seq experiments in which cells from unrelated individuals are pooled and captured at higher throughput than in standard workflows. Using simulated data, we show that 50 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) per cell are sufficient to assign 97% of singlets and identify 92% of doublets in pools of up to 64 individuals. Given genotyping data for each of eight pooled samples, demuxlet correctly recovers the sample identity of >99% of singlets and identifies doublets at rates consistent with previous estimates. We apply demuxlet to assess cell-type-specific changes in gene expression in 8 pooled lupus patient samples treated with interferon (IFN)-beta and perform eQTL analysis on 23 pooled samples.
35037023	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	sc-REnF: An entropy guided robust feature selection for single-cell RNA-seq data.	Annotation of cells in single-cell clustering requires a homogeneous grouping of cell populations. Since single-cell data are susceptible to technical noise, the quality of genes selected prior to clustering is of crucial importance in the preliminary steps of downstream analysis. Therefore, interest in robust gene selection has gained considerable attention in recent years. We introduce sc-REnF [robust entropy based feature (gene) selection method], aiming to leverage the advantages of $R\primeenyi$ and $Tsallis$ entropies in gene selection for single cell clustering. Experiments demonstrate that with tuned parameter ($q$), $R\primeenyi$ and $Tsallis$ entropies select genes that improved the clustering results significantly, over the other competing methods. sc-REnF can capture relevancy and redundancy among the features of noisy data extremely well due to its robust objective function. Moreover, the selected features/genes can able to determine the unknown cells with a high accuracy. Finally, sc-REnF yields good clustering performance in small sample, large feature scRNA-seq data. Availability: The sc-REnF is available at https://github.com/Snehalikalall/sc-REnF.
38886757	2024	Genome biology	Beyond benchmarking and towards predictive models of dataset-specific single-cell RNA-seq pipeline performance.	BACKGROUND: The advent of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has driven significant computational methods development for all steps in the scRNA-seq data analysis pipeline, including filtering, normalization, and clustering. The large number of methods and their resulting parameter combinations has created a combinatorial set of possible pipelines to analyze scRNA-seq data, which leads to the obvious question: which is best? Several benchmarking studies compare methods but frequently find variable performance depending on dataset and pipeline characteristics. Alternatively, the large number of scRNA-seq datasets along with advances in supervised machine learning raise a tantalizing possibility: could the optimal pipeline be predicted for a given dataset? RESULTS: Here, we begin to answer this question by applying 288 scRNA-seq analysis pipelines to 86 datasets and quantifying pipeline success via a range of measures evaluating cluster purity and biological plausibility. We build supervised machine learning models to predict pipeline success given a range of dataset and pipeline characteristics. We find that prediction performance is significantly better than random and that in many cases pipelines predicted to perform well provide clustering outputs similar to expert-annotated cell type labels. We identify characteristics of datasets that correlate with strong prediction performance that could guide when such prediction models may be useful. CONCLUSIONS: Supervised machine learning models have utility for recommending analysis pipelines and therefore the potential to alleviate the burden of choosing from the near-infinite number of possibilities. Different aspects of datasets influence the predictive performance of such models which will further guide users.
33956788	2021	PLoS computational biology	Performance assessment of sample-specific network control methods for bulk and single-cell biological data analysis.	In the past few years, a wealth of sample-specific network construction methods and structural network control methods has been proposed to identify sample-specific driver nodes for supporting the Sample-Specific network Control (SSC) analysis of biological networked systems. However, there is no comprehensive evaluation for these state-of-the-art methods. Here, we conducted a performance assessment for 16 SSC analysis workflows by using the combination of 4 sample-specific network reconstruction methods and 4 representative structural control methods. This study includes simulation evaluation of representative biological networks, personalized driver genes prioritization on multiple cancer bulk expression datasets with matched patient samples from TCGA, and cell marker genes and key time point identification related to cell differentiation on single-cell RNA-seq datasets. By widely comparing analysis of existing SSC analysis workflows, we provided the following recommendations and banchmarking workflows. (i) The performance of a network control method is strongly dependent on the up-stream sample-specific network method, and Cell-Specific Network construction (CSN) method and Single-Sample Network (SSN) method are the preferred sample-specific network construction methods. (ii) After constructing the sample-specific networks, the undirected network-based control methods are more effective than the directed network-based control methods. In addition, these data and evaluation pipeline are freely available on https://github.com/WilfongGuo/Benchmark_control.
39413798	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	SELF-Former: multi-scale gene filtration transformer for single-cell spatial reconstruction.	The spatial reconstruction of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data into spatial transcriptomics (ST) is a rapidly evolving field that addresses the significant challenge of aligning gene expression profiles to their spatial origins within tissues. This task is complicated by the inherent batch effects and the need for precise gene expression characterization to accurately reflect spatial information. To address these challenges, we developed SELF-Former, a transformer-based framework that utilizes multi-scale structures to learn gene representations, while designing spatial correlation constraints for the reconstruction of corresponding ST data. SELF-Former excels in recovering the spatial information of ST data and effectively mitigates batch effects between scRNA-seq and ST data. A novel aspect of SELF-Former is the introduction of a gene filtration module, which significantly enhances the spatial reconstruction task by selecting genes that are crucial for accurate spatial positioning and reconstruction. The superior performance and effectiveness of SELF-Former's modules have been validated across four benchmark datasets, establishing it as a robust and effective method for spatial reconstruction tasks. SELF-Former demonstrates its capability to extract meaningful gene expression information from scRNA-seq data and accurately map it to the spatial context of real ST data. Our method represents a significant advancement in the field, offering a reliable approach for spatial reconstruction.
24658644	2014	Nature biotechnology	The dynamics and regulators of cell fate decisions are revealed by pseudotemporal ordering of single cells.	Defining the transcriptional dynamics of a temporal process such as cell differentiation is challenging owing to the high variability in gene expression between individual cells. Time-series gene expression analyses of bulk cells have difficulty distinguishing early and late phases of a transcriptional cascade or identifying rare subpopulations of cells, and single-cell proteomic methods rely on a priori knowledge of key distinguishing markers. Here we describe Monocle, an unsupervised algorithm that increases the temporal resolution of transcriptome dynamics using single-cell RNA-Seq data collected at multiple time points. Applied to the differentiation of primary human myoblasts, Monocle revealed switch-like changes in expression of key regulatory factors, sequential waves of gene regulation, and expression of regulators that were not known to act in differentiation. We validated some of these predicted regulators in a loss-of function screen. Monocle can in principle be used to recover single-cell gene expression kinetics from a wide array of cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation and oncogenic transformation.
33927416	2021	Nature biotechnology	Bayesian inference of gene expression states from single-cell RNA-seq data.	Despite substantial progress in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data analysis methods, there is still little agreement on how to best normalize such data. Starting from the basic requirements that inferred expression states should correct for both biological and measurement sampling noise and that changes in expression should be measured in terms of fold changes, we here derive a Bayesian normalization procedure called Sanity (SAmpling-Noise-corrected Inference of Transcription activitY) from first principles. Sanity estimates expression values and associated error bars directly from raw unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts without any tunable parameters. Using simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets, we show that Sanity outperforms other normalization methods on downstream tasks, such as finding nearest-neighbor cells and clustering cells into subtypes. Moreover, we show that by systematically overestimating the expression variability of genes with low expression and by introducing spurious correlations through mapping the data to a lower-dimensional representation, other methods yield severely distorted pictures of the data.
30419955	2018	Genome biology	VIPER: variability-preserving imputation for accurate gene expression recovery in single-cell RNA sequencing studies.	We develop a method, VIPER, to impute the zero values in single-cell RNA sequencing studies to facilitate accurate transcriptome quantification at the single-cell level. VIPER is based on nonnegative sparse regression models and is capable of progressively inferring a sparse set of local neighborhood cells that are most predictive of the expression levels of the cell of interest for imputation. A key feature of our method is its ability to preserve gene expression variability across cells after imputation. We illustrate the advantages of our method through several well-designed real data-based analytical experiments.
39541191	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Deciphering gene expression patterns using large-scale transcriptomic data and its applications.	Gene expression varies stochastically across genders, racial groups, and health statuses. Deciphering these patterns is crucial for identifying informative genes, classifying samples, and understanding diseases like cancer. This study analyzes 11,252 bulk RNA-seq samples to explore expression patterns of 19,156 genes, including 10,512 cancer tissue samples and 740 normal samples. Additionally, 4,884 single-cell RNA-seq samples are examined. Statistical analysis using 16 probability distributions shows that normal samples display a wider range of distributions compared to cancer samples. Cancer samples tend to favor asymmetric distributions such as generalized extreme value, logarithmic normal, and Gaussian mixture distributions. In contrast, certain genes in normal samples exhibit symmetric distributions. Remarkably, more than 95.5% of genes exhibit non-normal distributions, which challenges traditional assumptions. Furthermore, distributions differ significantly between bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data. Many cancer driver genes exhibit distinct distribution patterns across sample types, suggesting potential for gene selection and classification based on distribution characteristics. A novel skewness-based metric is proposed to quantify distribution variation across datasets, showing genes with significant skewness differences have biological relevance. Finally, an improved naive Bayes method incorporating gene-specific distributions demonstrates superior performance in simulations over traditional methods. This work enhances understanding of gene expression and its application in omics-based gene selection and sample classification.
35699473	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scCNC: a method based on capsule network for clustering scRNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: A large number of studies have shown that clustering is a crucial step in scRNA-seq analysis. Most existing methods are based on unsupervised learning without the prior exploitation of any domain knowledge, which does not utilize available gold-standard labels. When confronted by the high dimensionality and general dropout events of scRNA-seq data, purely unsupervised clustering methods may not produce biologically interpretable clusters, which complicate cell type assignment. RESULTS: In this article, we propose a semi-supervised clustering method based on a capsule network named scCNC that integrates domain knowledge into the clustering step. Significantly, we also propose a Semi-supervised Greedy Iterative Training method used to train the whole network. Experiments on some real scRNA-seq datasets show that scCNC can significantly improve clustering performance and facilitate downstream analyses.

28003475	2017	Nucleic acids research	Single cell transcriptomics reveals unanticipated features of early hematopoietic precursors.	Molecular changes underlying stem cell differentiation are of fundamental interest. scRNA-seq on murine hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and their progeny MPP1 separated the cells into 3 main clusters with distinct features: active, quiescent, and an un-characterized cluster. Induction of anemia resulted in mobilization of the quiescent to the active cluster and of the early to later stage of cell cycle, with marked increase in expression of certain transcription factors (TFs) while maintaining expression of interferon response genes. Cells with surface markers of long term HSC increased the expression of a group of TFs expressed highly in normal cycling MPP1 cells. However, at least Id1 and Hes1 were significantly activated in both HSC and MPP1 cells in anemic mice. Lineage-specific genes were differently expressed between cells, and correlated with the cell cycle stages with a specific augmentation of erythroid related genes in the G2/M phase. Most lineage specific TFs were stochastically expressed in the early precursor cells, but a few, such as Klf1, were detected only at very low levels in few precursor cells. The activation of these factors may correlate with stages of differentiation. This study reveals effects of cell cycle progression on the expression of lineage specific genes in precursor cells, and suggests that hematopoietic stress changes the balance of renewal and differentiation in these homeostatic cells.
39060167	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	scLEGA: an attention-based deep clustering method with a tendency for low expression of genes on single-cell RNA-seq data.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables the exploration of biological heterogeneity among different cell types within tissues at a resolution. Inferring cell types within tissues is foundational for downstream research. Most existing methods for cell type inference based on scRNA-seq data primarily utilize highly variable genes (HVGs) with higher expression levels as clustering features, overlooking the contribution of HVGs with lower expression levels. To address this, we have designed a novel cell type inference method for scRNA-seq data, termed scLEGA. scLEGA employs a novel zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) loss function that fully considers the contribution of genes with lower expression levels and combines two distinct scRNA-seq clustering strategies through a multi-head attention mechanism. It utilizes a low-expression optimized denoising autoencoder, based on the novel ZINB model, to extract low-dimensional features and handle dropout events, and a GCN-based graph autoencoder (GAE) that leverages neighbor information to guide dimensionality reduction. The iterative fusion of denoising and topological embedding in scLEGA facilitates the acquisition of cluster-friendly cell representations in the hidden embedding, where similar cells are brought closer together. Compared to 12 state-of-the-art cell type inference methods on 15 scRNA-seq datasets, scLEGA demonstrates superior performance in clustering accuracy, scalability, and stability. Our scLEGA model codes are freely available at https://github.com/Masonze/scLEGA-main.
33480403	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	DSTG: deconvoluting spatial transcriptomics data through graph-based artificial intelligence.	Recent development of spatial transcriptomics (ST) is capable of associating spatial information at different spots in the tissue section with RNA abundance of cells within each spot, which is particularly important to understand tissue cytoarchitectures and functions. However, for such ST data, since a spot is usually larger than an individual cell, gene expressions measured at each spot are from a mixture of cells with heterogenous cell types. Therefore, ST data at each spot needs to be disentangled so as to reveal the cell compositions at that spatial spot. In this study, we propose a novel method, named deconvoluting spatial transcriptomics data through graph-based convolutional networks (DSTG), to accurately deconvolute the observed gene expressions at each spot and recover its cell constitutions, thus achieving high-level segmentation and revealing spatial architecture of cellular heterogeneity within tissues. DSTG not only demonstrates superior performance on synthetic spatial data generated from different protocols, but also effectively identifies spatial compositions of cells in mouse cortex layer, hippocampus slice and pancreatic tumor tissues. In conclusion, DSTG accurately uncovers the cell states and subpopulations based on spatial localization. DSTG is available as a ready-to-use open source software (https://github.com/Su-informatics-lab/DSTG) for precise interrogation of spatial organizations and functions in tissues.
38741183	2024	Genome biology	SCIPAC: quantitative estimation of cell-phenotype associations.	Numerous algorithms have been proposed to identify cell types in single-cell RNA sequencing data, yet a fundamental problem remains: determining associations between cells and phenotypes such as cancer. We develop SCIPAC, the first algorithm that quantitatively estimates the association between each cell in single-cell data and a phenotype. SCIPAC also provides a p-value for each association and applies to data with virtually any type of phenotype. We demonstrate SCIPAC's accuracy in simulated data. On four real cancerous or noncancerous datasets, insights from SCIPAC help interpret the data and generate new hypotheses. SCIPAC requires minimum tuning and is computationally very fast.
35134135	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	JEBIN: analyzing gene co-expressions across multiple datasets by joint network embedding.	The inference of gene co-expression associations is one of the fundamental tasks for large-scale transcriptomic data analysis. Due to the high dimensionality and high noises in transcriptomic data, it is difficult to infer stable gene co-expression associations from single dataset. Meta-analysis of multisource data can effectively tackle this problem. We proposed Joint Embedding of multiple BIpartite Networks (JEBIN) to learn the low-dimensional consensus representation for genes by integrating multiple expression datasets. JEBIN infers gene co-expression associations in a nonlinear and global similarity manner and can integrate datasets with different distributions in linear time complexity with the gene and total sample size. The effectiveness and scalability of JEBIN were verified by simulation experiments, and its superiority over the commonly used integration methods was proved by three indexes on real biological datasets. Then, JEBIN was applied to study the gene co-expression patterns of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) based on multiple expression datasets of HCC and adjacent normal tissues, and further on latest HCC single-cell RNA-seq data. Results show that gene co-expressions are highly different between bulk and single-cell datasets. Finally, many differentially co-expressed ligand-receptor pairs were discovered by comparing HCC with adjacent normal data, providing candidate HCC targets for abnormal cell-cell communications.
37449901	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Cytocipher determines significantly different populations of cells in single-cell RNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: Identification of cell types using single-cell RNA-seq is revolutionizing the study of multicellular organisms. However, typical single-cell RNA-seq analysis often involves post hoc manual curation to ensure clusters are transcriptionally distinct, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and irreproducible. RESULTS: To overcome these obstacles, we developed Cytocipher, a bioinformatics method and scverse compatible software package that statistically determines significant clusters. Application of Cytocipher to normal tissue, development, disease, and large-scale atlas data reveals the broad applicability and power of Cytocipher to generate biological insights in numerous contexts. This included the identification of cell types not previously described in the datasets analysed, such as CD8+ T cell subtypes in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells; cell lineage intermediate states during mouse pancreas development; and subpopulations of luminal epithelial cells over-represented in prostate cancer. Cytocipher also scales to large datasets with high-test performance, as shown by application to the Tabula Sapiens Atlas representing >480 000 cells. Cytocipher is a novel and generalizable method that statistically determines transcriptionally distinct and programmatically reproducible clusters from single-cell data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The software version used for this manuscript has been deposited on Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8089546), and is also available via github (https://github.com/BradBalderson/Cytocipher).
33408405	2021	Nature methods	Mapping the functional landscape of T cell receptor repertoires by single-T cell transcriptomics.	Many experimental and bioinformatics approaches have been developed to characterize the human T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire. However, the unknown functional relevance of TCR profiling hinders unbiased interpretation of the biology of T cells. To address this inadequacy, we developed tessa, a tool to integrate TCRs with gene expression of T cells to estimate the effect that TCRs confer on the phenotypes of T cells. Tessa leveraged techniques combining single-cell RNA-sequencing with TCR sequencing. We validated tessa and showed its superiority over existing approaches that investigate only the TCR sequences. With tessa, we demonstrated that TCR similarity constrains the phenotypes of T cells to be similar and dictates a gradient in antigen targeting efficiency of T cell clonotypes with convergent TCRs. We showed this constraint could predict a functional dichotomization of T cells postimmunotherapy treatment and is weakened in tumor contexts.
31955711	2020	Genome biology	Benchmarking principal component analysis for large-scale single-cell RNA-sequencing.	BACKGROUND: Principal component analysis (PCA) is an essential method for analyzing single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) datasets, but for large-scale scRNA-seq datasets, computation time is long and consumes large amounts of memory. RESULTS: In this work, we review the existing fast and memory-efficient PCA algorithms and implementations and evaluate their practical application to large-scale scRNA-seq datasets. Our benchmark shows that some PCA algorithms based on Krylov subspace and randomized singular value decomposition are fast, memory-efficient, and more accurate than the other algorithms. CONCLUSION: We develop a guideline to select an appropriate PCA implementation based on the differences in the computational environment of users and developers.
36946414	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Poincare maps for visualization of large protein families.	In the era of constantly increasing amounts of the available protein data, a relevant and interpretable visualization becomes crucial, especially for tasks requiring human expertise. Poincare disk projection has previously demonstrated its important efficiency for visualization of biological data such as single-cell RNAseq data. Here, we develop a new method PoincareMSA for visual representation of complex relationships between protein sequences based on Poincare maps embedding. We demonstrate its efficiency and potential for visualization of protein family topology as well as evolutionary and functional annotation of uncharacterized sequences. PoincareMSA is implemented in open source Python code with available interactive Google Colab notebooks as described at https://www.dsimb.inserm.fr/POINCARE_MSA.
37169965	2024	Nature biotechnology	Comparative analysis of cell-cell communication at single-cell resolution.	Inference of cell-cell communication from single-cell RNA sequencing data is a powerful technique to uncover intercellular communication pathways, yet existing methods perform this analysis at the level of the cell type or cluster, discarding single-cell-level information. Here we present Scriabin, a flexible and scalable framework for comparative analysis of cell-cell communication at single-cell resolution that is performed without cell aggregation or downsampling. We use multiple published atlas-scale datasets, genetic perturbation screens and direct experimental validation to show that Scriabin accurately recovers expected cell-cell communication edges and identifies communication networks that can be obscured by agglomerative methods. Additionally, we use spatial transcriptomic data to show that Scriabin can uncover spatial features of interaction from dissociated data alone. Finally, we demonstrate applications to longitudinal datasets to follow communication pathways operating between timepoints. Our approach represents a broadly applicable strategy to reveal the full structure of niche-phenotype relationships in health and disease.
33108369	2020	PLoS computational biology	Iterative point set registration for aligning scRNA-seq data.	Several studies profile similar single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) data using different technologies and platforms. A number of alignment methods have been developed to enable the integration and comparison of scRNA-Seq data from such studies. While each performs well on some of the datasets, to date no method was able to both perform the alignment using the original expression space and generalize to new data. To enable such analysis we developed Single Cell Iterative Point set Registration (SCIPR) which extends methods that were successfully applied to align image data to scRNA-Seq. We discuss the required changes needed, the resulting optimization function, and algorithms for learning a transformation function for aligning data. We tested SCIPR on several scRNA-Seq datasets. As we show it successfully aligns data from several different cell types, improving upon prior methods proposed for this task. In addition, we show the parameters learned by SCIPR can be used to align data not used in the training and to identify key cell type-specific genes.
41325426	2025	PLoS computational biology	D3Impute: Dropout-aware discrimination, distribution-aware modeling, and density-guide imputation for scRNA-seq data.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized the study of cellular heterogeneity. A major challenge, however, lies in the prevalence of non-biological zeros-false measurements caused by technical limitations that mask a cell's true transcriptome. This fundamental issue of distinguishing these artifacts from true biological zeros, where a gene is genuinely absent, remains a key hurdle for computational methods, as misclassification can distort biological signals during data recovery. To overcome this, we introduce D3Impute, a discriminative imputation framework built on three key innovations: (1) a distribution-aware normalization step that adapts to dataset-specific characteristics while preserving meaningful biological variation; (2) a dual-network discriminator that uses bulk RNA-seq data as a biological reference to accurately identify non-biological zeros while retaining the true biological zeros; and (3) a density-guided imputation engine that recovers expression values while maintaining local cellular neighborhood structures. Through comprehensive benchmarking against 12 state-of-the-art methods across six diverse datasets, D3Impute demonstrates consistent and significant improvements in essential downstream analyses, including cell clustering, trajectory inference, and differential expression detection. Furthermore, we provide an extensive practical evaluation of D3Impute, demonstrating its robustness across varying data qualities and providing clear guidelines for optimal application. By offering a robust, biologically informed, and user-oriented solution, D3Impute not only enhances scRNA-seq data analysis but also offers a generalizable framework for handling zero-inflated data in computational biology.
33970215	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Differential gene expression analysis for multi-subject single-cell RNA-sequencing studies with aggregateBioVar.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides more granular biological information than bulk RNA-sequencing; bulk RNA sequencing remains popular due to lower costs which allows processing more biological replicates and design more powerful studies. As scRNA-seq costs have decreased, collecting data from more than one biological replicate has become more feasible, but careful modeling of different layers of biological variation remains challenging for many users. Here, we propose a statistical model for scRNA-seq gene counts, describe a simple method for estimating model parameters and show that failing to account for additional biological variation in scRNA-seq studies can inflate false discovery rates (FDRs) of statistical tests. RESULTS: First, in a simulation study, we show that when the gene expression distribution of a population of cells varies between subjects, a naive approach to differential expression analysis will inflate the FDR. We then compare multiple differential expression testing methods on scRNA-seq datasets from human samples and from animal models. These analyses suggest that a naive approach to differential expression testing could lead to many false discoveries; in contrast, an approach based on pseudobulk counts has better FDR control. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: A software package, aggregateBioVar, is freely available on Bioconductor (https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/aggregateBioVar.html) to accommodate compatibility with upstream and downstream methods in scRNA-seq data analysis pipelines. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Raw gene-by-cell count matrices for pig scRNA-seq data are available as GEO accession GSE150211. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
35043939	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Identify, quantify and characterize cellular communication from single-cell RNA sequencing data with scSeqComm.	MOTIVATION: Recently, single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data have been used to study cellular communication. Most bioinformatics methods infer only the intercellular signaling between groups of cells, mainly exploiting ligand-receptor expression levels. Only few methods consider the entire intercellular + intracellular signaling, mainly inferring lists/networks of signaling involved genes. RESULTS: Here, we present scSeqComm, a computational method to identify and quantify the evidence of ongoing intercellular and intracellular signaling from scRNA-seq data, and at the same time providing a functional characterization of the inferred cellular communication. The possibility to quantify the evidence of ongoing communication assists the prioritization of the results, while the combined evidence of both intercellular and intracellular signaling increase the reliability of inferred communication. The application to a scRNA-seq dataset of tumor microenvironment, the agreement with independent bioinformatics analysis, the validation using spatial transcriptomics data and the comparison with state-of-the-art intercellular scoring schemes confirmed the robustness and reliability of the proposed method. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: scSeqComm R package is freely available at https://gitlab.com/sysbiobig/scseqcomm and https://sysbiobig.dei.unipd.it/software/#scSeqComm. Submitted software version and test data are available in Zenodo, at https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5833298. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
37313714	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Deep enhanced constraint clustering based on contrastive learning for scRNA-seq data.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) measures transcriptome-wide gene expression at single-cell resolution. Clustering analysis of scRNA-seq data enables researchers to characterize cell types and states, shedding new light on cell-to-cell heterogeneity in complex tissues. Recently, self-supervised contrastive learning has become a prominent technique for underlying feature representation learning. However, for the noisy, high-dimensional and sparse scRNA-seq data, existing methods still encounter difficulties in capturing the intrinsic patterns and structures of cells, and seldom utilize prior knowledge, resulting in clusters that mismatch with the real situation. To this end, we propose scDECL, a novel deep enhanced constraint clustering algorithm for scRNA-seq data analysis based on contrastive learning and pairwise constraints. Specifically, based on interpolated contrastive learning, a pre-training model is trained to learn the feature embedding, and then perform clustering according to the constructed enhanced pairwise constraint. In the pre-training stage, a mixup data augmentation strategy and interpolation loss is introduced to improve the diversity of the dataset and the robustness of the model. In the clustering stage, the prior information is converted into enhanced pairwise constraints to guide the clustering. To validate the performance of scDECL, we compare it with six state-of-the-art algorithms on six real scRNA-seq datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed algorithm outperforms the six competing methods. In addition, the ablation studies on each module of the algorithm indicate that these modules are complementary to each other and effective in improving the performance of the proposed algorithm. Our method scDECL is implemented in Python using the Pytorch machine-learning library, and it is freely available at https://github.com/DBLABDHU/scDECL.
31937348	2020	Genome biology	DENDRO: genetic heterogeneity profiling and subclone detection by single-cell RNA sequencing.	Although scRNA-seq is now ubiquitously adopted in studies of intratumor heterogeneity, detection of somatic mutations and inference of clonal membership from scRNA-seq is currently unreliable. We propose DENDRO, an analysis method for scRNA-seq data that clusters single cells into genetically distinct subclones and reconstructs the phylogenetic tree relating the subclones. DENDRO utilizes transcribed point mutations and accounts for technical noise and expression stochasticity. We benchmark DENDRO and demonstrate its application on simulation data and real data from three cancer types. In particular, on a mouse melanoma model in response to immunotherapy, DENDRO delineates the role of neoantigens in treatment response.
38678387	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	CPPLS-MLP: a method for constructing cell-cell communication networks and identifying related highly variable genes based on single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomics data.	In the growth and development of multicellular organisms, the immune processes of the immune system and the maintenance of the organism's internal environment, cell communication plays a crucial role. It exerts a significant influence on regulating internal cellular states such as gene expression and cell functionality. Currently, the mainstream methods for studying intercellular communication are focused on exploring the ligand-receptor-transcription factor and ligand-receptor-subunit scales. However, there is relatively limited research on the association between intercellular communication and highly variable genes (HVGs). As some HVGs are closely related to cell communication, accurately identifying these HVGs can enhance the accuracy of constructing cell communication networks. The rapid development of single-cell sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics technologies provides a data foundation for exploring the relationship between intercellular communication and HVGs. Therefore, we propose CPPLS-MLP, which can identify HVGs closely related to intercellular communication and further analyze the impact of Multiple Input Multiple Output cellular communication on the differential expression of these HVGs. By comparing with the commonly used method CCPLS for constructing intercellular communication networks, we validated the superior performance of our method in identifying cell-type-specific HVGs and effectively analyzing the influence of neighboring cell types on HVG expression regulation. Source codes for the CPPLS_MLP R, python packages and the related scripts are available at 'CPPLS_MLP Github [https://github.com/wuzhenao/CPPLS-MLP]'.
37864221	2023	Genome biology	Measuring cell-to-cell expression variability in single-cell RNA-sequencing data: a comparative analysis and applications to B cell aging.	BACKGROUND: Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies enable the capture of gene expression heterogeneity and consequently facilitate the study of cell-to-cell variability at the cell type level. Although different methods have been proposed to quantify cell-to-cell variability, it is unclear what the optimal statistical approach is, especially in light of challenging data structures that are unique to scRNA-seq data like zero inflation. RESULTS: We systematically evaluate the performance of 14 different variability metrics that are commonly applied to transcriptomic data for measuring cell-to-cell variability. Leveraging simulations and real datasets, we benchmark the metric performance based on data-specific features, sparsity and sequencing platform, biological properties, and the ability to recapitulate true levels of biological variability based on known gene sets. Next, we use scran, the metric with the strongest all-round performance, to investigate changes in cell-to-cell variability that occur during B cell differentiation and the aging processes. The analysis of primary cell types from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and B lymphopoiesis reveals unique gene signatures with consistent patterns of variable and stable expression profiles during B cell differentiation which highlights the significance of these methods. Identifying differentially variable genes between young and old cells elucidates the regulatory changes that may be overlooked by solely focusing on mean expression changes and we investigate this in the context of regulatory networks. CONCLUSIONS: We highlight the importance of capturing cell-to-cell gene expression variability in a complex biological process like differentiation and aging and emphasize the value of these findings at the level of individual cell types.
33619563	2021	Nucleic acids research	Independent component analysis based gene co-expression network inference (ICAnet) to decipher functional modules for better single-cell clustering and batch integration.	With the tremendous increase of publicly available single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets, bioinformatics methods based on gene co-expression network are becoming efficient tools for analyzing scRNA-seq data, improving cell type prediction accuracy and in turn facilitating biological discovery. However, the current methods are mainly based on overall co-expression correlation and overlook co-expression that exists in only a subset of cells, thus fail to discover certain rare cell types and sensitive to batch effect. Here, we developed independent component analysis-based gene co-expression network inference (ICAnet) that decomposed scRNA-seq data into a series of independent gene expression components and inferred co-expression modules, which improved cell clustering and rare cell-type discovery. ICAnet showed efficient performance for cell clustering and batch integration using scRNA-seq datasets spanning multiple cells/tissues/donors/library types. It works stably on datasets produced by different library construction strategies and with different sequencing depths and cell numbers. We demonstrated the capability of ICAnet to discover rare cell types in multiple independent scRNA-seq datasets from different sources. Importantly, the identified modules activated in acute myeloid leukemia scRNA-seq datasets have the potential to serve as new diagnostic markers. Thus, ICAnet is a competitive tool for cell clustering and biological interpretations of single-cell RNA-seq data analysis.
41288963	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scRegulate: Single-Cell Regulatory-Embedded Variational Inference of Transcription Factor Activity from Gene Expression.	MOTIVATION: Accurately inferring transcription factor (TF) activity from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data remains a fundamental challenge in computational biology. While existing methods rely on statistical models, motif enrichment, or prior-based inference, they often depend on deterministic assumptions about regulatory relationships and rely on static regulatory databases. Few approaches effectively integrate prior biological knowledge with data-driven inference to capture novel, dynamic, and context-specific regulatory interactions. RESULTS: To address these limitations, we develop scRegulate, a generative deep learning framework leveraging variational inference to estimate TF activities guided by experimental TF-target gene relationships and progressively adapted based on the input scRNA-seq data. By integrating structured biological constraints with a probabilistic latent space model, scRegulate offers a scalable and biologically grounded estimation of TF activity and gene regulatory network (GRN). Comprehensively benchmarking on public experimental and synthetic datasets demonstrates scRegulate's superior ability. Further, scRegulate accurately recapitulates experimentally validated TF knockdown effects on a Perturb-seq dataset for key TFs. Applied to experimental human PBMC scRNA-seq data, scRegulate infers cell-type-specific GRNs and identifies differentially active TFs aligned with known regulatory pathways. scRegulate's TF activity representations capture transcriptional heterogeneity, enabling accurate clustering of cell types. scRegulate is highly efficient, frequently an order of magnitude faster than common baselines. Collectively, our results establish scRegulate as a powerful, interpretable, and scalable framework for inferring TF activities and GRNs from single-cell transcriptomics. AVAILABILITY: Results and scripts available at github.com/YDaiLab/scRegulate. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

38374263	2024	Nature methods	Generation of complex bone marrow organoids from human induced pluripotent stem cells.	The human bone marrow (BM) niche sustains hematopoiesis throughout life. We present a method for generating complex BM-like organoids (BMOs) from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). BMOs consist of key cell types that self-organize into spatially defined three-dimensional structures mimicking cellular, structural and molecular characteristics of the hematopoietic microenvironment. Functional properties of BMOs include the presence of an in vivo-like vascular network, the presence of multipotent mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells, the support of neutrophil differentiation and responsiveness to inflammatory stimuli. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed a heterocellular composition including the presence of a hematopoietic stem/progenitor (HSPC) cluster expressing genes of fetal HSCs. BMO-derived HSPCs also exhibited lymphoid potential and a subset demonstrated transient engraftment potential upon xenotransplantation in mice. We show that the BMOs could enable the modeling of hematopoietic developmental aspects and inborn errors of hematopoiesis, as shown for human VPS45 deficiency. Thus, iPSC-derived BMOs serve as a physiologically relevant in vitro model of the human BM microenvironment to study hematopoietic development and BM diseases.
28351406	2017	Genome biology	CIDR: Ultrafast and accurate clustering through imputation for single-cell RNA-seq data.	Most existing dimensionality reduction and clustering packages for single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data deal with dropouts by heavy modeling and computational machinery. Here, we introduce CIDR (Clustering through Imputation and Dimensionality Reduction), an ultrafast algorithm that uses a novel yet very simple implicit imputation approach to alleviate the impact of dropouts in scRNA-seq data in a principled manner. Using a range of simulated and real data, we show that CIDR improves the standard principal component analysis and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, namely t-SNE, ZIFA, and RaceID, in terms of clustering accuracy. CIDR typically completes within seconds when processing a data set of hundreds of cells and minutes for a data set of thousands of cells. CIDR can be downloaded at https://github.com/VCCRI/CIDR .
29608178	2018	Nature biotechnology	Simultaneous single-cell profiling of lineages and cell types in the vertebrate brain.	The lineage relationships among the hundreds of cell types generated during development are difficult to reconstruct. A recent method, GESTALT, used CRISPR-Cas9 barcode editing for large-scale lineage tracing, but was restricted to early development and did not identify cell types. Here we present scGESTALT, which combines the lineage recording capabilities of GESTALT with cell-type identification by single-cell RNA sequencing. The method relies on an inducible system that enables barcodes to be edited at multiple time points, capturing lineage information from later stages of development. Sequencing of  approximately 60,000 transcriptomes from the juvenile zebrafish brain identified >100 cell types and marker genes. Using these data, we generate lineage trees with hundreds of branches that help uncover restrictions at the level of cell types, brain regions, and gene expression cascades during differentiation. scGESTALT can be applied to other multicellular organisms to simultaneously characterize molecular identities and lineage histories of thousands of cells during development and disease.

37024980	2023	Genome biology	Identification of cell barcodes from long-read single-cell RNA-seq with BLAZE.	Long-read single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables the quantification of RNA isoforms in individual cells. However, long-read scRNA-seq using the Oxford Nanopore platform has largely relied upon matched short-read data to identify cell barcodes. We introduce BLAZE, which accurately and efficiently identifies 10x cell barcodes using only nanopore long-read scRNA-seq data. BLAZE outperforms the existing tools and provides an accurate representation of the cells present in long-read scRNA-seq when compared to matched short reads. BLAZE simplifies long-read scRNA-seq while improving the results, is compatible with downstream tools accepting a cell barcode file, and is available at https://github.com/shimlab/BLAZE .

33406262	2021	Nucleic acids research	Chromatin regulatory dynamics of early human small intestinal development using a directed differentiation model.	The establishment of the small intestinal (SI) lineage during human embryogenesis ensures functional integrity of the intestine after birth. The chromatin dynamics that drive SI lineage formation and regional patterning in humans are essentially unknown. To fill this knowledge void, we apply a cutting-edge genomic technology to a state-of-the-art human model of early SI development. Specifically, we leverage chromatin run-on sequencing (ChRO-seq) to define the landscape of active promoters, enhancers and gene bodies across distinct stages of directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into SI spheroids with regional specification. Through comprehensive ChRO-seq analysis we identify candidate stage-specific chromatin activity states, novel markers and enhancer hotspots during the directed differentiation. Moreover, we propose a detailed transcriptional network associated with SI lineage formation or regional patterning. Our ChRO-seq analyses uncover a previously undescribed pattern of enhancer activity and transcription at HOX gene loci underlying SI regional patterning. We also validated this unique HOX dynamics by the analysis of single cell RNA-seq data from human fetal SI. Overall, the results lead to a new proposed working model for the regulatory underpinnings of human SI development, thereby adding a novel dimension to the literature that has relied almost exclusively on non-human models.
40515392	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	scValue: value-based subsampling of large-scale single-cell transcriptomic data for machine and deep learning tasks.	Large single-cell ribonucleic acid-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets offer unprecedented biological insights but present substantial computational challenges for visualization and analysis. While existing subsampling methods can enhance efficiency, they may not ensure optimal performance in downstream machine learning and deep learning (ML/DL) tasks. Here, we introduce scValue, a novel approach that ranks individual cells by 'data value' using out-of-bag estimates from a random forest model. scValue prioritizes high-value cells and allocates greater representation to cell types with higher variability in data value, effectively preserving key biological signals within subsamples. We benchmarked scValue on automatic cell-type annotation tasks across four large datasets, paired with distinct ML/DL models. Our method consistently outperformed existing subsampling methods, closely matching full-data performance across all annotation tasks. In three additional case studies-label transfer learning, cross-study label harmonization, and bulk RNA-seq deconvolution-scValue more effectively preserved T-cell annotations across human gut-colon datasets, more accurately reproduced T-cell subtype relationships in a human spleen dataset, and constructed a more reliable single-cell immune reference for cell-type deconvolution in simulated bulk tissue samples. Finally, using 16 public datasets ranging from tens of thousands to millions of cells, we evaluated subsampling quality based on computational time, Gini coefficient, and Hausdorff distance. scValue demonstrated fast execution, well-balanced cell-type representation, and distributional properties akin to uniform sampling. Overall, scValue provides a robust and scalable solution for subsampling large scRNA-seq data in ML/DL workflows. It is available as an open-source Python package installable via pip, with source code at https://github.com/LHBCB/scvalue.
28100584	2017	Genome research	UMI-tools: modeling sequencing errors in Unique Molecular Identifiers to improve quantification accuracy.	Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs) are random oligonucleotide barcodes that are increasingly used in high-throughput sequencing experiments. Through a UMI, identical copies arising from distinct molecules can be distinguished from those arising through PCR amplification of the same molecule. However, bioinformatic methods to leverage the information from UMIs have yet to be formalized. In particular, sequencing errors in the UMI sequence are often ignored or else resolved in an ad hoc manner. We show that errors in the UMI sequence are common and introduce network-based methods to account for these errors when identifying PCR duplicates. Using these methods, we demonstrate improved quantification accuracy both under simulated conditions and real iCLIP and single-cell RNA-seq data sets. Reproducibility between iCLIP replicates and single-cell RNA-seq clustering are both improved using our proposed network-based method, demonstrating the value of properly accounting for errors in UMIs. These methods are implemented in the open source UMI-tools software package.
27081004	2016	Genome biology	Single-cell analysis of long non-coding RNAs in the developing human neocortex.	BACKGROUND: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) comprise a diverse class of transcripts that can regulate molecular and cellular processes in brain development and disease. LncRNAs exhibit cell type- and tissue-specific expression, but little is known about the expression and function of lncRNAs in the developing human brain. Furthermore, it has been unclear whether lncRNAs are highly expressed in subsets of cells within tissues, despite appearing lowly expressed in bulk populations. RESULTS: We use strand-specific RNA-seq to deeply profile lncRNAs from polyadenylated and total RNA obtained from human neocortex at different stages of development, and we apply this reference to analyze the transcriptomes of single cells. While lncRNAs are generally detected at low levels in bulk tissues, single-cell transcriptomics of hundreds of neocortex cells reveal that many lncRNAs are abundantly expressed in individual cells and are cell type-specific. Notably, LOC646329 is a lncRNA enriched in single radial glia cells but is detected at low abundance in tissues. CRISPRi knockdown of LOC646329 indicates that this lncRNA regulates cell proliferation. CONCLUSION: The discrete and abundant expression of lncRNAs among individual cells has important implications for both their biological function and utility for distinguishing neural cell types.
38454173	2025	Nature biotechnology	Prediction of tumor-reactive T cell receptors from scRNA-seq data for personalized T cell therapy.	The identification of patient-derived, tumor-reactive T cell receptors (TCRs) as a basis for personalized transgenic T cell therapies remains a time- and cost-intensive endeavor. Current approaches to identify tumor-reactive TCRs analyze tumor mutations to predict T cell activating (neo)antigens and use these to either enrich tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) cultures or validate individual TCRs for transgenic autologous therapies. Here we combined high-throughput TCR cloning and reactivity validation to train predicTCR, a machine learning classifier that identifies individual tumor-reactive TILs in an antigen-agnostic manner based on single-TIL RNA sequencing. PredicTCR identifies tumor-reactive TCRs in TILs from diverse cancers better than previous gene set enrichment-based approaches, increasing specificity and sensitivity (geometric mean) from 0.38 to 0.74. By predicting tumor-reactive TCRs in a matter of days, TCR clonotypes can be prioritized to accelerate the manufacture of personalized T cell therapies.
35858747	2022	Genome research	Identifying cell state-associated alternative splicing events and their coregulation.	Alternative splicing shapes the transcriptome and contributes to each cell's unique identity, but single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has struggled to capture the impact of alternative splicing. We previously showed that low recovery of mRNAs from single cells led to erroneous conclusions about the cell-to-cell variability of alternative splicing. Here, we present a method, Psix, to confidently identify splicing that changes across a landscape of single cells, using a probabilistic model that is robust against the data limitations of scRNA-seq. Its autocorrelation-inspired approach finds patterns of alternative splicing that correspond to patterns of cell identity, such as cell type or developmental stage, without the need for explicit cell clustering, labeling, or trajectory inference. Applying Psix to data that follow the trajectory of mouse brain development, we identify exons whose alternative splicing patterns cluster into modules of coregulation. We show that the exons in these modules are enriched for binding by distinct neuronal splicing factors and that their changes in splicing correspond to changes in expression of these splicing factors. Thus, Psix reveals cell type-dependent splicing patterns and the wiring of the splicing regulatory networks that control them. Our new method will enable scRNA-seq analysis to go beyond transcription to understand the roles of post-transcriptional regulation in determining cell identity.
30768159	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Dhaka: variational autoencoder for unmasking tumor heterogeneity from single cell genomic data.	MOTIVATION: Intra-tumor heterogeneity is one of the key confounding factors in deciphering tumor evolution. Malignant cells exhibit variations in their gene expression, copy numbers and mutation even when originating from a single progenitor cell. Single cell sequencing of tumor cells has recently emerged as a viable option for unmasking the underlying tumor heterogeneity. However, extracting features from single cell genomic data in order to infer their evolutionary trajectory remains computationally challenging due to the extremely noisy and sparse nature of the data. RESULTS: Here we describe 'Dhaka', a variational autoencoder method which transforms single cell genomic data to a reduced dimension feature space that is more efficient in differentiating between (hidden) tumor subpopulations. Our method is general and can be applied to several different types of genomic data including copy number variation from scDNA-Seq and gene expression from scRNA-Seq experiments. We tested the method on synthetic and six single cell cancer datasets where the number of cells ranges from 250 to 6000 for each sample. Analysis of the resulting feature space revealed subpopulations of cells and their marker genes. The features are also able to infer the lineage and/or differentiation trajectory between cells greatly improving upon prior methods suggested for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction of such data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: All the datasets used in the paper are publicly available and developed software package and supporting info is available on Github https://github.com/MicrosoftGenomics/Dhaka. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
28263960	2017	Nature methods	Visualization and analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data by kernel-based similarity learning.	We present single-cell interpretation via multikernel learning (SIMLR), an analytic framework and software which learns a similarity measure from single-cell RNA-seq data in order to perform dimension reduction, clustering and visualization. On seven published data sets, we benchmark SIMLR against state-of-the-art methods. We show that SIMLR is scalable and greatly enhances clustering performance while improving the visualization and interpretability of single-cell sequencing data.
38580401	2024	Genome research	Systematic mapping of TF-mediated cell fate changes by a pooled induction coupled with scRNA-seq and multi-omics approaches.	Transcriptional regulation controls cellular functions through interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and their chromosomal targets. However, understanding the fate conversion potential of multiple TFs in an inducible manner remains limited. Here, we introduce iTF-seq as a method for identifying individual TFs that can alter cell fate toward specific lineages at a single-cell level. iTF-seq enables time course monitoring of transcriptome changes, and with biotinylated individual TFs, it provides a multi-omics approach to understanding the mechanisms behind TF-mediated cell fate changes. Our iTF-seq study in mouse embryonic stem cells identified multiple TFs that trigger rapid transcriptome changes indicative of differentiation within a day of induction. Moreover, cells expressing these potent TFs often show a slower cell cycle and increased cell death. Further analysis using bioChIP-seq revealed that GCM1 and OTX2 act as pioneer factors and activators by increasing gene accessibility and activating the expression of lineage specification genes during cell fate conversion. iTF-seq has utility in both mapping cell fate conversion and understanding cell fate conversion mechanisms.
40671175	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	scRDAN: a robust domain adaptation network for cell type annotation across single-cell RNA sequencing data.	Single-cell RNA sequencing technology facilitates the recognition of diverse cell types and subgroups, playing a crucial role in investigating cellular heterogeneity. Cell type annotation, a crucial process in single-cell RNA sequencing analysis, is often influenced by noise and batch effects. To address these challenges, we propose scRDAN, which is a robust domain adaptation network comprising three modules: the denoising domain adaptation module, the fine-grained discrimination module, and the robustness enhancement module. The denoising domain adaptation module mitigates noise interference through feature reconstruction in domains, while leveraging adversarial learning to align data distributions, improving annotation accuracy and robustness against batch effects. The fine-grained discrimination module maintains intra-class compactness and enhances inter-class separability, reducing feature overlap and improving cell type distinction. Finally, the robustness enhancement module introduces noise from various perspectives in both domains, enhancing robustness and generalization. We evaluate scRDAN on simulated, cross-platforms, and cross-species datasets, comparing it with advanced methods. Results demonstrate that scRDAN outperforms existing methods in handling batch effects and cell type annotation.
36567258	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Bubble: a fast single-cell RNA-seq imputation using an autoencoder constrained by bulk RNA-seq data.	Single-cell RNA-sequencing technology (scRNA-seq) brings research to single-cell resolution. However, a major drawback of scRNA-seq is large sparsity, i.e. expressed genes with no reads due to technical noise or limited sequence depth during the scRNA-seq protocol. This phenomenon is also called 'dropout' events, which likely affect downstream analyses such as differential expression analysis, the clustering and visualization of cell subpopulations, cellular trajectory inference, etc. Therefore, there is a need to develop a method to identify and impute these dropout events. We propose Bubble, which first identifies dropout events from all zeros based on expression rate and coefficient of variation of genes within cell subpopulation, and then leverages an autoencoder constrained by bulk RNA-seq data to only impute those values. Unlike other deep learning-based imputation methods, Bubble fuses the matched bulk RNA-seq data as a constraint to reduce the introduction of false positive signals. Using simulated and several real scRNA-seq datasets, we demonstrate that Bubble enhances the recovery of missing values, gene-to-gene and cell-to-cell correlations, and reduces the introduction of false positive signals. Regarding some crucial downstream analyses of scRNA-seq data, Bubble facilitates the identification of differentially expressed genes, improves the performance of clustering and visualization, and aids the construction of cellular trajectory. More importantly, Bubble provides fast and scalable imputation with minimal memory usage.
33690599	2021	PLoS computational biology	Transcriptional bursts explain autosomal random monoallelic expression and affect allelic imbalance.	Transcriptional bursts render substantial biological noise in cellular transcriptomes. Here, we investigated the theoretical extent of allelic expression resulting from transcriptional bursting and how it compared to the amount biallelic, monoallelic and allele-biased expression observed in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. We found that transcriptional bursting can explain the allelic expression patterns observed in single cells, including the frequent observations of autosomal monoallelic gene expression. Importantly, we identified that the burst frequency largely determined the fraction of cells with monoallelic expression, whereas the burst size had little effect on monoallelic observations. The high consistency between the bursting model predictions and scRNA-seq observations made it possible to assess the heterogeneity of a group of cells as their deviation in allelic observations from the expected. Finally, both burst frequency and size contributed to allelic imbalance observations and reinforced that studies of allelic imbalance can be confounded from the inherent noise in transcriptional bursting. Altogether, we demonstrate that allele-level transcriptional bursting renders widespread, although predictable, amounts of monoallelic and biallelic expression in single cells and cell populations.
37669275	2023	PLoS computational biology	Trackplot: A flexible toolkit for combinatorial analysis of genomic data.	Here, we introduce Trackplot, a Python package for generating publication-quality visualization by a programmable and interactive web-based approach. Compared to the existing versions of programs generating sashimi plots, Trackplot offers a versatile platform for visually interpreting genomic data from a wide variety of sources, including gene annotation with functional domain mapping, isoform expression, isoform structures identified by scRNA-seq and long-read sequencing, as well as chromatin accessibility and architecture without any preprocessing, and also offers a broad degree of flexibility for formats of output files that satisfy the requirements of major journals.

SUMMARY: Cellular lineage trees can be derived from single-cell RNA sequencing snapshots of differentiating cells. Currently, only datasets with simple topologies are available. To test and further develop tools for lineage tree reconstruction, we need test datasets with known complex topologies. PROSSTT can simulate scRNA-seq datasets for differentiation processes with lineage trees of any desired complexity, noise level, noise model and size. PROSSTT also provides scripts to quantify the quality of predicted lineage trees. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: https://github.com/soedinglab/prosstt.

40257984	2025	PLoS computational biology	Identifying reproducible transcription regulator coexpression patterns with single cell transcriptomics.	The proliferation of single cell transcriptomics has potentiated our ability to unveil patterns that reflect dynamic cellular processes such as the regulation of gene transcription. In this study, we leverage a broad collection of single cell RNA-seq data to identify the gene partners whose expression is most coordinated with each human and mouse transcription regulator (TR). We assembled 120 human and 103 mouse scRNA-seq datasets from the literature (>28 million cells), constructing a single cell coexpression network for each. We aimed to understand the consistency of TR coexpression profiles across a broad sampling of biological contexts, rather than examine the preservation of context-specific signals. Our workflow therefore explicitly prioritizes the patterns that are most reproducible across cell types. Towards this goal, we characterize the similarity of each TR's coexpression within and across species. We create single cell coexpression rankings for each TR, demonstrating that this aggregated information recovers literature curated targets on par with ChIP-seq data. We then combine the coexpression and ChIP-seq information to identify candidate regulatory interactions supported across methods and species. Finally, we highlight interactions for the important neural TR ASCL1 to demonstrate how our compiled information can be adopted for community use.
37088976	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Dimensionality reduction and visualization of single-cell RNA-seq data with an improved deep variational autoencoder.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a revolutionary breakthrough that determines the precise gene expressions on individual cells and deciphers cell heterogeneity and subpopulations. However, scRNA-seq data are much noisier than traditional high-throughput RNA-seq data because of technical limitations, leading to many scRNA-seq data studies about dimensionality reduction and visualization remaining at the basic data-stacking stage. In this study, we propose an improved variational autoencoder model (termed DREAM) for dimensionality reduction and a visual analysis of scRNA-seq data. Here, DREAM combines the variational autoencoder and Gaussian mixture model for cell type identification, meanwhile explicitly solving 'dropout' events by introducing the zero-inflated layer to obtain the low-dimensional representation that describes the changes in the original scRNA-seq dataset. Benchmarking comparisons across nine scRNA-seq datasets show that DREAM outperforms four state-of-the-art methods on average. Moreover, we prove that DREAM can accurately capture the expression dynamics of human preimplantation embryonic development. DREAM is implemented in Python, freely available via the GitHub website, https://github.com/Crystal-JJ/DREAM.
25867923	2015	Nature biotechnology	Spatial reconstruction of single-cell gene expression data.	Spatial localization is a key determinant of cellular fate and behavior, but methods for spatially resolved, transcriptome-wide gene expression profiling across complex tissues are lacking. RNA staining methods assay only a small number of transcripts, whereas single-cell RNA-seq, which measures global gene expression, separates cells from their native spatial context. Here we present Seurat, a computational strategy to infer cellular localization by integrating single-cell RNA-seq data with in situ RNA patterns. We applied Seurat to spatially map 851 single cells from dissociated zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos and generated a transcriptome-wide map of spatial patterning. We confirmed Seurat's accuracy using several experimental approaches, then used the strategy to identify a set of archetypal expression patterns and spatial markers. Seurat correctly localizes rare subpopulations, accurately mapping both spatially restricted and scattered groups. Seurat will be applicable to mapping cellular localization within complex patterned tissues in diverse systems.
32726427	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	netAE: semi-supervised dimensionality reduction of single-cell RNA sequencing to facilitate cell labeling.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing allows us to study cell heterogeneity at an unprecedented cell-level resolution and identify known and new cell populations. Current cell labeling pipeline uses unsupervised clustering and assigns labels to clusters by manual inspection. However, this pipeline does not utilize available gold-standard labels because there are usually too few of them to be useful to most computational methods. This article aims to facilitate cell labeling with a semi-supervised method in an alternative pipeline, in which a few gold-standard labels are first identified and then extended to the rest of the cells computationally. RESULTS: We built a semi-supervised dimensionality reduction method, a network-enhanced autoencoder (netAE). Tested on three public datasets, netAE outperforms various dimensionality reduction baselines and achieves satisfactory classification accuracy even when the labeled set is very small, without disrupting the similarity structure of the original space. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The code of netAE is available on GitHub: https://github.com/LeoZDong/netAE. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
32421805	2020	Nucleic acids research	IRIS3: integrated cell-type-specific regulon inference server from single-cell RNA-Seq.	A group of genes controlled as a unit, usually by the same repressor or activator gene, is known as a regulon. The ability to identify active regulons within a specific cell type, i.e., cell-type-specific regulons (CTSR), provides an extraordinary opportunity to pinpoint crucial regulators and target genes responsible for complex diseases. However, the identification of CTSRs from single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) data is computationally challenging. We introduce IRIS3, the first-of-its-kind web server for CTSR inference from scRNA-Seq data for human and mouse. IRIS3 is an easy-to-use server empowered by over 20 functionalities to support comprehensive interpretations and graphical visualizations of identified CTSRs. CTSR data can be used to reliably characterize and distinguish the corresponding cell type from others and can be combined with other computational or experimental analyses for biomedical studies. CTSRs can, therefore, aid in the discovery of major regulatory mechanisms and allow reliable constructions of global transcriptional regulation networks encoded in a specific cell type. The broader impact of IRIS3 includes, but is not limited to, investigation of complex diseases hierarchies and heterogeneity, causal gene regulatory network construction, and drug development. IRIS3 is freely accessible from https://bmbl.bmi.osumc.edu/iris3/ with no login requirement.
31428792	2019	Nucleic acids research	Global prediction of chromatin accessibility using small-cell-number and single-cell RNA-seq.	Conventional high-throughput genomic technologies for mapping regulatory element activities in bulk samples such as ChIP-seq, DNase-seq and FAIRE-seq cannot analyze samples with small numbers of cells. The recently developed low-input and single-cell regulome mapping technologies such as ATAC-seq and single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) allow analyses of small-cell-number and single-cell samples, but their signals remain highly discrete or noisy. Compared to these regulome mapping technologies, transcriptome profiling by RNA-seq is more widely used. Transcriptome data in single-cell and small-cell-number samples are more continuous and often less noisy. Here, we show that one can globally predict chromatin accessibility and infer regulatory element activities using RNA-seq. Genome-wide chromatin accessibility predicted by RNA-seq from 30 cells can offer better accuracy than ATAC-seq from 500 cells. Predictions based on single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) can more accurately reconstruct bulk chromatin accessibility than using scATAC-seq. Integrating ATAC-seq with predictions from RNA-seq increases the power and value of both methods. Thus, transcriptome-based prediction provides a new tool for decoding gene regulatory circuitry in samples with limited cell numbers.
24836921	2014	Nature methods	Bayesian approach to single-cell differential expression analysis.	Single-cell data provide a means to dissect the composition of complex tissues and specialized cellular environments. However, the analysis of such measurements is complicated by high levels of technical noise and intrinsic biological variability. We describe a probabilistic model of expression-magnitude distortions typical of single-cell RNA-sequencing measurements, which enables detection of differential expression signatures and identification of subpopulations of cells in a way that is more tolerant of noise.
35654951	2022	Nature methods	Identification of cell types in multiplexed in situ images by combining protein expression and spatial information using CELESTA.	Advances in multiplexed in situ imaging are revealing important insights in spatial biology. However, cell type identification remains a major challenge in imaging analysis, with most existing methods involving substantial manual assessment and subjective decisions for thousands of cells. We developed an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, CELESTA, which identifies the cell type of each cell, individually, using the cell's marker expression profile and, when needed, its spatial information. We demonstrate the performance of CELESTA on multiplexed immunofluorescence images of colorectal cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Using the cell types identified by CELESTA, we identify tissue architecture associated with lymph node metastasis in HNSCC, and validate our findings in an independent cohort. By coupling our spatial analysis with single-cell RNA-sequencing data on proximal sections of the same specimens, we identify cell-cell crosstalk associated with lymph node metastasis, demonstrating the power of CELESTA to facilitate identification of clinically relevant interactions.
37129540	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	BUSZ: compressed BUS files.	SUMMARY: We describe a compression scheme for BUS files and an implementation of the algorithm in the BUStools software. Our compression algorithm yields smaller file sizes than gzip, at significantly faster compression and decompression speeds. We evaluated our algorithm on 533 BUS files from scRNA-seq experiments with a total size of 1TB. Our compression is 2.2x faster than the fastest gzip option 35% slower than the fastest zstd option and results in 1.5x smaller files than both methods. This amounts to an 8.3x reduction in the file size, resulting in a compressed size of 122GB for the dataset.

32203388	2020	Nature methods	Cardelino: computational integration of somatic clonal substructure and single-cell transcriptomes.	Bulk and single-cell DNA sequencing has enabled reconstructing clonal substructures of somatic tissues from frequency and cooccurrence patterns of somatic variants. However, approaches to characterize phenotypic variations between clones are not established. Here we present cardelino (https://github.com/single-cell-genetics/cardelino), a computational method for inferring the clonal tree configuration and the clone of origin of individual cells assayed using single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq). Cardelino flexibly integrates information from imperfect clonal trees inferred based on bulk exome-seq data, and sparse variant alleles expressed in scRNA-seq data. We apply cardelino to a published cancer dataset and to newly generated matched scRNA-seq and exome-seq data from 32 human dermal fibroblast lines, identifying hundreds of differentially expressed genes between cells from different somatic clones. These genes are frequently enriched for cell cycle and proliferation pathways, indicating a role for cell division genes in somatic evolution in healthy skin.
41062448	2025	Nucleic acids research	So3D: a comprehensive three-dimensional spatial omics resource for decoding tissue architecture in physiology and disease.	Cells function within intricate three-dimensional (3D) architectures to form tissues and organs. Constructing 3D tissue structure is critical for understanding cellular states, biological processes, and intercellular interactions. Herein, we describe a comprehensive 3D spatial omics resource, So3D (http://bio-bigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/So3D or https://so3d.bio-database.com/), which aims to construct 3D tissue architecture and dissect biological processes occurring in 3D space from multiple perspectives. We systematically collected 72 sets of 3D spatial transcriptome datasets, involving 1 132 902 spots across 882 slices from four species, and matched reference single-cell RNA-sequencing data, covering 763 893 cells from 28 datasets. So3D also provides multiple flexible analysis modules for retrieving and analyzing 3D tissue, such as inference of 3D spatial domains and gene expression patterns across 3D tissue regions, 2D spatial slices, and single-cell datasets; mapping of cell type distribution and cell-cell communication networks to explore intercellular crosstalk in 3D space; and functional annotation of biological pathways and signaling networks within 3D tissue contexts. Collectively, So3D provides comprehensive insights for investigating biologically meaningful 3D spatial domains, mapping local gene expression landscapes, functional state, and communication networks in tissue, and may also serve as an efficient and reliable tool for understanding the tissue microenvironment and discovering biomarkers.
34351383	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	Selecting gene features for unsupervised analysis of single-cell gene expression data.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies facilitate the characterization of transcriptomic landscapes in diverse species, tissues, and cell types with unprecedented molecular resolution. In order to evaluate various biological hypotheses using high-dimensional single-cell gene expression data, most computational and statistical methods depend on a gene feature selection step to identify genes with high biological variability and reduce computational complexity. Even though many gene selection methods have been developed for scRNA-seq analysis, there lacks a systematic comparison of the assumptions, statistical models, and selection criteria used by these methods. In this article, we summarize and discuss 17 computational methods for selecting gene features in unsupervised analysis of single-cell gene expression data, with unified notations and statistical frameworks. Our discussion provides a useful summary to help practitioners select appropriate methods based on their assumptions and applicability, and to assist method developers in designing new computational tools for unsupervised learning of scRNA-seq data.
39705183	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Scope+: an open source generalizable architecture for single-cell RNA-seq atlases at sample and cell levels.	SUMMARY: With the recent advancement in single-cell RNA-sequencing technologies and the increased availability of integrative tools, challenges arise in easy and fast access to large collections of cell atlas. Existing cell atlas portals rarely are open sourced and adaptable, and do not support meta-analysis at cell level. Here, we present an open source, highly optimized and scalable architecture, named Scope+, to allow quick access, meta-analysis and cell-level selection of the atlas data. We applied this architecture to our well-curated 5 million COVID-19 blood and immune cells, as a portal called Covidscope. We achieved efficient access to atlas-scale data via three strategies, such as cell-as-unit data modelling, novel database optimization techniques and innovative software architectural design. Scope+ serves as an open source architecture for researchers to build on with their own atlas. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The COVID-19 web portal, data and meta-analysis are available on Covidscope (https://covidsc.d24h.hk/). User tutorials on how to implement Scope+ architecture with their atlases can be found at https://hiyin.github.io/scopeplus-user-tutorial/. Scope+ source code can be found at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14174632 and https://github.com/hiyin/scopeplus.
33961003	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Clustering single-cell RNA-seq data by rank constrained similarity learning.	MOTIVATION: Recent breakthroughs of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies offer an exciting opportunity to identify heterogeneous cell types in complex tissues. However, the unavoidable biological noise and technical artifacts in scRNA-seq data as well as the high dimensionality of expression vectors make the problem highly challenging. Consequently, although numerous tools have been developed, their accuracy remains to be improved. RESULTS: Here, we introduce a novel clustering algorithm and tool RCSL (Rank Constrained Similarity Learning) to accurately identify various cell types using scRNA-seq data from a complex tissue. RCSL considers both local similarity and global similarity among the cells to discern the subtle differences among cells of the same type as well as larger differences among cells of different types. RCSL uses Spearman's rank correlations of a cell's expression vector with those of other cells to measure its global similarity, and adaptively learns neighbor representation of a cell as its local similarity. The overall similarity of a cell to other cells is a linear combination of its global similarity and local similarity. RCSL automatically estimates the number of cell types defined in the similarity matrix, and identifies them by constructing a block-diagonal matrix, such that its distance to the similarity matrix is minimized. Each block-diagonal submatrix is a cell cluster/type, corresponding to a connected component in the cognate similarity graph. When tested on 16 benchmark scRNA-seq datasets in which the cell types are well-annotated, RCSL substantially outperformed six state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness as measured by three metrics.

32657375	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Hopper: a mathematically optimal algorithm for sketching biological data.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA-sequencing has grown massively in scale since its inception, presenting substantial analytic and computational challenges. Even simple downstream analyses, such as dimensionality reduction and clustering, require days of runtime and hundreds of gigabytes of memory for today's largest datasets. In addition, current methods often favor common cell types, and miss salient biological features captured by small cell populations. RESULTS: Here we present Hopper, a single-cell toolkit that both speeds up the analysis of single-cell datasets and highlights their transcriptional diversity by intelligent subsampling, or sketching. Hopper realizes the optimal polynomial-time approximation of the Hausdorff distance between the full and downsampled dataset, ensuring that each cell is well-represented by some cell in the sample. Unlike prior sketching methods, Hopper adds points iteratively and allows for additional sampling from regions of interest, enabling fast and targeted multi-resolution analyses. In a dataset of over 1.3 million mouse brain cells, Hopper detects a cluster of just 64 macrophages expressing inflammatory genes (0.004% of the full dataset) from a Hopper sketch containing just 5000 cells, and several other small but biologically interesting immune cell populations invisible to analysis of the full data. On an even larger dataset consisting of  approximately 2 million developing mouse organ cells, we show Hopper's even representation of important cell types in small sketches, in contrast with prior sketching methods. We also introduce Treehopper, which uses spatial partitioning to speed up Hopper by orders of magnitude with minimal loss in performance. By condensing transcriptional information encoded in large datasets, Hopper and Treehopper grant the individual user with a laptop the analytic capabilities of a large consortium. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The code for Hopper is available at https://github.com/bendemeo/hopper. In addition, we have provided sketches of many of the largest single-cell datasets, available at http://hopper.csail.mit.edu.
37460676	2024	Nature biotechnology	Young glial progenitor cells competitively replace aged and diseased human glia in the adult chimeric mouse brain.	Competition among adult brain cells has not been extensively researched. To investigate whether healthy glia can outcompete diseased human glia in the adult forebrain, we engrafted wild-type (WT) human glial progenitor cells (hGPCs) produced from human embryonic stem cells into the striata of adult mice that had been neonatally chimerized with mutant Huntingtin (mHTT)-expressing hGPCs. The WT hGPCs outcompeted and ultimately eliminated their human Huntington's disease (HD) counterparts, repopulating the host striata with healthy glia. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that WT hGPCs acquired a YAP1/MYC/E2F-defined dominant competitor phenotype upon interaction with the host HD glia. WT hGPCs also outcompeted older resident isogenic WT cells that had been transplanted neonatally, suggesting that competitive success depended primarily on the relative ages of competing populations, rather than on the presence of mHTT. These data indicate that aged and diseased human glia may be broadly replaced in adult brain by younger healthy hGPCs, suggesting a therapeutic strategy for the replacement of aged and diseased human glia.
29871653	2018	Genome biology	SINC-seq: correlation of transient gene expressions between nucleus and cytoplasm reflects single-cell physiology.	We report a microfluidic system that physically separates nuclear RNA (nucRNA) and cytoplasmic RNA (cytRNA) from a single cell and enables single-cell integrated nucRNA and cytRNA-sequencing (SINC-seq). SINC-seq constructs two individual RNA-seq libraries, nucRNA and cytRNA, per cell, quantifies gene expression in the subcellular compartments, and combines them to create novel single-cell RNA-seq data. Leveraging SINC-seq, we discover distinct natures of correlation among cytRNA and nucRNA that reflect the transient physiological state of single cells. These data provide unique insights into the regulatory network of messenger RNA from the nucleus toward the cytoplasm at the single-cell level.
27083558	2016	Genome biology	Beyond comparisons of means: understanding changes in gene expression at the single-cell level.	Traditional differential expression tools are limited to detecting changes in overall expression, and fail to uncover the rich information provided by single-cell level data sets. We present a Bayesian hierarchical model that builds upon BASiCS to study changes that lie beyond comparisons of means, incorporating built-in normalization and quantifying technical artifacts by borrowing information from spike-in genes. Using a probabilistic approach, we highlight genes undergoing changes in cell-to-cell heterogeneity but whose overall expression remains unchanged. Control experiments validate our method's performance and a case study suggests that novel biological insights can be revealed. Our method is implemented in R and available at https://github.com/catavallejos/BASiCS.
40465796	2025	PLoS computational biology	DeepDeconUQ estimates malignant cell fraction prediction intervals in bulk RNA-seq tissue.	Accurate estimation of malignant cell fractions in tissues plays a critical role in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and subsequent treatment decisions. However, most currently available methods provide only point estimates, neglecting the quantification of uncertainties, which is essential for both clinical and research applications. This study introduces DeepDeconUQ, a deep neural network model developed to estimate prediction intervals for malignant cell fractions based on bulk RNA-seq data. This approach addresses limitations in current malignant cell fraction estimation methods by integrating uncertainty quantification into predictions of cancer cell fractions. DeepDeconUQ leverages single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data in conjunction with conformalized quantile regression to produce reliable prediction intervals. The model trains a quantile regression neural network to establish upper and lower bounds for cancer cell proportions, followed by a calibration step that refines these intervals to ensure both statistical validity (coverage probability) and discrimination (narrow intervals). Benchmark analyses indicate that DeepDeconUQ consistently surpasses existing methods, achieving high coverage accuracy with tight prediction intervals across simulated and real cancer datasets. The robustness of DeepDeconUQ is further demonstrated by its resilience to various gene expression perturbations. The DeepDeconUQ method is publicly accessible at https://github.com/jiaweih14/DeepDeconUQ.
33875866	2021	Nature biotechnology	Iterative single-cell multi-omic integration using online learning.	Integrating large single-cell gene expression, chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation datasets requires general and scalable computational approaches. Here we describe online integrative non-negative matrix factorization (iNMF), an algorithm for integrating large, diverse and continually arriving single-cell datasets. Our approach scales to arbitrarily large numbers of cells using fixed memory, iteratively incorporates new datasets as they are generated and allows many users to simultaneously analyze a single copy of a large dataset by streaming it over the internet. Iterative data addition can also be used to map new data to a reference dataset. Comparisons with previous methods indicate that the improvements in efficiency do not sacrifice dataset alignment and cluster preservation performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of online iNMF by integrating more than 1 million cells on a standard laptop, integrating large single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomic datasets, and iteratively constructing a single-cell multi-omic atlas of the mouse motor cortex.
32817073	2020	Genome research	RNA-Bloom enables reference-free and reference-guided sequence assembly for single-cell transcriptomes.	Despite the rapid advance in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies within the last decade, single-cell transcriptome analysis workflows have primarily used gene expression data while isoform sequence analysis at the single-cell level still remains fairly limited. Detection and discovery of isoforms in single cells is difficult because of the inherent technical shortcomings of scRNA-seq data, and existing transcriptome assembly methods are mainly designed for bulk RNA samples. To address this challenge, we developed RNA-Bloom, an assembly algorithm that leverages the rich information content aggregated from multiple single-cell transcriptomes to reconstruct cell-specific isoforms. Assembly with RNA-Bloom can be either reference-guided or reference-free, thus enabling unbiased discovery of novel isoforms or foreign transcripts. We compared both assembly strategies of RNA-Bloom against five state-of-the-art reference-free and reference-based transcriptome assembly methods. In our benchmarks on a simulated 384-cell data set, reference-free RNA-Bloom reconstructed 37.9%-38.3% more isoforms than the best reference-free assembler, whereas reference-guided RNA-Bloom reconstructed 4.1%-11.6% more isoforms than reference-based assemblers. When applied to a real 3840-cell data set consisting of more than 4 billion reads, RNA-Bloom reconstructed 9.7%-25.0% more isoforms than the best competing reference-based and reference-free approaches evaluated. We expect RNA-Bloom to boost the utility of scRNA-seq data beyond gene expression analysis, expanding what is informatically accessible now.
28991892	2017	Nature methods	SCENIC: single-cell regulatory network inference and clustering.	We present SCENIC, a computational method for simultaneous gene regulatory network reconstruction and cell-state identification from single-cell RNA-seq data (http://scenic.aertslab.org). On a compendium of single-cell data from tumors and brain, we demonstrate that cis-regulatory analysis can be exploited to guide the identification of transcription factors and cell states. SCENIC provides critical biological insights into the mechanisms driving cellular heterogeneity.
38989623	2024	Nucleic acids research	CilioGenics: an integrated method and database for predicting novel ciliary genes.	Uncovering the full list of human ciliary genes holds enormous promise for the diagnosis of cilia-related human diseases, collectively known as ciliopathies. Currently, genetic diagnoses of many ciliopathies remain incomplete (1-3). While various independent approaches theoretically have the potential to reveal the entire list of ciliary genes, approximately 30% of the genes on the ciliary gene list still stand as ciliary candidates (4,5). These methods, however, have mainly relied on a single strategy to uncover ciliary candidate genes, making the categorization challenging due to variations in quality and distinct capabilities demonstrated by different methodologies. Here, we develop a method called CilioGenics that combines several methodologies (single-cell RNA sequencing, protein-protein interactions (PPIs), comparative genomics, transcription factor (TF) network analysis, and text mining) to predict the ciliary capacity of each human gene. Our combined approach provides a CilioGenics score for every human gene that represents the probability that it will become a ciliary gene. Compared to methods that rely on a single method, CilioGenics performs better in its capacity to predict ciliary genes. Our top 500 gene list includes 258 new ciliary candidates, with 31 validated experimentally by us and others. Users may explore the whole list of human genes and CilioGenics scores on the CilioGenics database (https://ciliogenics.com/).
41091889	2025	Nucleic acids research	iFish: a comprehensive multi-omics database for fish genetics, transcriptional regulation, and epigenetic research.	The explosive expansion of fish multi-omics data is reshaping basic and applied research in fisheries and aquaculture. Here, we introduce iFish, a rigorously curated and comprehensive resource that integrates genome, transcriptome, epigenome, and proteome datasets from 88 fish species. From 884 whole-genome sequencing datasets, we identified 137.04 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms and 45.52 million insertions/deletions. Leveraging 9797 bulk RNA-seq, 293 single-cell RNA-seq, and 840 microRNA (miRNA)-seq datasets, we quantified 1.87 million messenger RNAs, 287 873 long noncoding RNAs, 197 554 circular RNAs, and 6068 mature miRNAs across different tissues of multiple species. By integrating 1563 epigenetics sequencing datasets, we provided genome-wide maps of histone modifications, chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation, and three-dimensional chromatin interactions. Furthermore, 50 proteomics projects were included for protein expression profiling. In addition, to facilitate gene analyses, we also curated 2.7 million gene annotation entries, identified homologous genes, annotated 192 107 transcription factors (TFs), constructed TF regulatory networks and gene co-expression networks, and performed cross-species conservation analyses of noncoding RNAs. Finally, we established the iFish database (https://gonglab.hzau.edu.cn/iFish/), a user-friendly platform that supports interactive browsing, visualization, and download. With comprehensive data and useful tools, iFish will advance genetic, transcriptional-regulatory, and epigenetic investigations, and accelerate genetic improvement and practical applications in aquaculture.
39103856	2024	Genome biology	scPriorGraph: constructing biosemantic cell-cell graphs with prior gene set selection for cell type identification from scRNA-seq data.	Cell type identification is an indispensable analytical step in single-cell data analyses. To address the high noise stemming from gene expression data, existing computational methods often overlook the biologically meaningful relationships between genes, opting to reduce all genes to a unified data space. We assume that such relationships can aid in characterizing cell type features and improving cell type recognition accuracy. To this end, we introduce scPriorGraph, a dual-channel graph neural network that integrates multi-level gene biosemantics. Experimental results demonstrate that scPriorGraph effectively aggregates feature values of similar cells using high-quality graphs, achieving state-of-the-art performance in cell type identification.
37603589	2023	PLoS computational biology	STREAK: A supervised cell surface receptor abundance estimation strategy for single cell RNA-sequencing data using feature selection and thresholded gene set scoring.	The accurate estimation of cell surface receptor abundance for single cell transcriptomics data is important for the tasks of cell type and phenotype categorization and cell-cell interaction quantification. We previously developed an unsupervised receptor abundance estimation technique named SPECK (Surface Protein abundance Estimation using CKmeans-based clustered thresholding) to address the challenges associated with accurate abundance estimation. In that paper, we concluded that SPECK results in improved concordance with Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing (CITE-seq) data relative to comparative unsupervised abundance estimation techniques using only single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. In this paper, we outline a new supervised receptor abundance estimation method called STREAK (gene Set Testing-based Receptor abundance Estimation using Adjusted distances and cKmeans thresholding) that leverages associations learned from joint scRNA-seq/CITE-seq training data and a thresholded gene set scoring mechanism to estimate receptor abundance for scRNA-seq target data. We evaluate STREAK relative to both unsupervised and supervised receptor abundance estimation techniques using two evaluation approaches on six joint scRNA-seq/CITE-seq datasets that represent four human and mouse tissue types. We conclude that STREAK outperforms other abundance estimation strategies and provides a more biologically interpretable and transparent statistical model.
30143032	2018	Genome biology	Comparative transcriptomic analyses and single-cell RNA sequencing of the freshwater planarian Schmidtea mediterranea identify major cell types and pathway conservation.	BACKGROUND: In the Lophotrochozoa/Spiralia superphylum, few organisms have as high a capacity for rapid testing of gene function and single-cell transcriptomics as the freshwater planaria. The species Schmidtea mediterranea in particular has become a powerful model to use in studying adult stem cell biology and mechanisms of regeneration. Despite this, systematic attempts to define gene complements and their annotations are lacking, restricting comparative analyses that detail the conservation of biochemical pathways and identify lineage-specific innovations. RESULTS: In this study we compare several transcriptomes and define a robust set of 35,232 transcripts. From this, we perform systematic functional annotations and undertake a genome-scale metabolic reconstruction for S. mediterranea. Cross-species comparisons of gene content identify conserved, lineage-specific, and expanded gene families, which may contribute to the regenerative properties of planarians. In particular, we find that the TRAF gene family has been greatly expanded in planarians. We further provide a single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of 2000 cells, revealing both known and novel cell types defined by unique signatures of gene expression. Among these are a novel mesenchymal cell population as well as a cell type involved in eye regeneration. Integration of our metabolic reconstruction further reveals the extent to which given cell types have adapted energy and nucleotide biosynthetic pathways to support their specialized roles. CONCLUSIONS: In general, S. mediterranea displays a high level of gene and pathway conservation compared with other model systems, rendering it a viable model to study the roles of these pathways in stem cell biology and regeneration.
32868927	2020	Nature methods	Massively parallel and time-resolved RNA sequencing in single cells with scNT-seq.	Single-cell RNA sequencing offers snapshots of whole transcriptomes but obscures the temporal RNA dynamics. Here we present single-cell metabolically labeled new RNA tagging sequencing (scNT-seq), a method for massively parallel analysis of newly transcribed and pre-existing mRNAs from the same cell. This droplet microfluidics-based method enables high-throughput chemical conversion on barcoded beads, efficiently marking newly transcribed mRNAs with T-to-C substitutions. Using scNT-seq, we jointly profiled new and old transcriptomes in ~55,000 single cells. These data revealed time-resolved transcription factor activities and cell-state trajectories at the single-cell level in response to neuronal activation. We further determined rates of RNA biogenesis and decay to uncover RNA regulatory strategies during stepwise conversion between pluripotent and rare totipotent two-cell embryo (2C)-like stem cell states. Finally, integrating scNT-seq with genetic perturbation identifies DNA methylcytosine dioxygenase as an epigenetic barrier into the 2C-like cell state. Time-resolved single-cell transcriptomic analysis thus opens new lines of inquiry regarding cell-type-specific RNA regulatory mechanisms.
39775477	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Addressing scalability and managing sparsity and dropout events in single-cell representation identification with ZIGACL.	Despite significant advancements in single-cell representation learning, scalability and managing sparsity and dropout events continue to challenge the field as scRNA-seq datasets expand. While current computational tools struggle to maintain both efficiency and accuracy, the accurate connection of these dropout events to specific biological functions usually requires additional, complex experiments, often hampered by potential inaccuracies in cell-type annotation. To tackle these challenges, the Zero-Inflated Graph Attention Collaborative Learning (ZIGACL) method has been developed. This innovative approach combines a Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial model with a Graph Attention Network, leveraging mutual information from neighboring cells to enhance dimensionality reduction and apply dynamic adjustments to the learning process through a co-supervised deep graph clustering model. ZIGACL's integration of denoising and topological embedding significantly improves clustering accuracy and ensures similar cells are grouped closely in the latent space. Comparative analyses across nine real scRNA-seq datasets have shown that ZIGACL significantly enhances single-cell data analysis by offering superior clustering performance and improved stability in cell representations, effectively addressing scalability and managing sparsity and dropout events, thereby advancing our understanding of cellular heterogeneity.
41057862	2025	Genome biology	High-precision cell-type mapping and annotation of single-cell spatial transcriptomics with STAMapper.	In this paper, we develop a heterogeneous graph neural network, STAMapper, to transfer the cell-type labels from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to single-cell spatial transcriptomics (scST) data. We collect 81 scST datasets consisting of 344 slices and 16 paired scRNA-seq datasets from eight technologies and five tissues to validate the efficiency of STAMapper. STAMapper achieves the best performance on 75 out of 81 datasets compared to competing methods in accuracy. STAMapper demonstrates enhanced performance over manual annotations, particularly at the boundaries of cell clusters, enables the unknown cell-type detection in scST data, and exhibits precise cell subtype annotations.
39578100	2024	Genome research	Global identification of mammalian host and nested gene pairs reveal tissue-specific transcriptional interplay.	Nucleotide sequences along a gene provide instructions to transcriptional and cotranscriptional machinery allowing genome expansion into the transcriptome. Nucleotide sequence can often be shared between two genes and in some occurrences, a gene is located completely within a different gene; these are known as host/nested gene pairs. In these instances, if both genes are transcribed, overlap can result in a transcriptional crosstalk where genes regulate each other. Despite this, a comprehensive annotation of where such genes are located and their expression patterns is lacking. To address this, we provide an up-to-date catalog of host/nested gene pairs in mouse and human, showing that over a tenth of all genes contain a nested gene. We discovered that transcriptional co-occurrence is often tissue specific. This coexpression was especially prevalent within the transcriptionally permissive tissue, testis. We use this developmental system and scRNA-seq analysis to demonstrate that the coexpression of pairs can occur in single cells and transcription in the same place at the same time can enhance the transcript diversity of the host gene. In agreement, host genes are more transcript-diverse than the rest of the transcriptome. Host/nested gene configurations are common in both human and mouse, suggesting that interplay between gene pairs is a feature of the mammalian genome. This highlights the relevance of transcriptional crosstalk between genes which share nucleic acid sequence. The results and analysis are available on an Rshiny application (https://hngeneviewer.sites.er.kcl.ac.uk/hn_viewer/).
35451460	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scSGL: kernelized signed graph learning for single-cell gene regulatory network inference.	MOTIVATION: Elucidating the topology of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from large single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, while effectively capturing its inherent cell-cycle heterogeneity and dropouts, is currently one of the most pressing problems in computational systems biology. Recently, graph learning (GL) approaches based on graph signal processing have been developed to infer graph topology from signals defined on graphs. However, existing GL methods are not suitable for learning signed graphs, a characteristic feature of GRNs, which are capable of accounting for both activating and inhibitory relationships in the gene network. They are also incapable of handling high proportion of zero values present in the single cell datasets. RESULTS: To this end, we propose a novel signed GL approach, scSGL, that learns GRNs based on the assumption of smoothness and non-smoothness of gene expressions over activating and inhibitory edges, respectively. scSGL is then extended with kernels to account for non-linearity of co-expression and for effective handling of highly occurring zero values. The proposed approach is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem and solved using an efficient ADMM framework. Performance assessment using simulated datasets demonstrates the superior performance of kernelized scSGL over existing state of the art methods in GRN recovery. The performance of scSGL is further investigated using human and mouse embryonic datasets. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The scSGL code and analysis scripts are available on https://github.com/Single-Cell-Graph-Learning/scSGL. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
30902100	2019	Genome biology	EmptyDrops: distinguishing cells from empty droplets in droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing data.	Droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing protocols have dramatically increased the throughput of single-cell transcriptomics studies. A key computational challenge when processing these data is to distinguish libraries for real cells from empty droplets. Here, we describe a new statistical method for calling cells from droplet-based data, based on detecting significant deviations from the expression profile of the ambient solution. Using simulations, we demonstrate that EmptyDrops has greater power than existing approaches while controlling the false discovery rate among detected cells. Our method also retains distinct cell types that would have been discarded by existing methods in several real data sets.

40152244	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scMUSCL: multi-source transfer learning for clustering scRNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis relies heavily on effective clustering to facilitate numerous downstream applications. Although several machine learning methods have been developed to enhance single-cell clustering, most are fully unsupervised and overlook the rich repository of annotated datasets available from previous single-cell experiments. Since cells are inherently high-dimensional entities, unsupervised clustering can often result in clusters that lack biological relevance. Leveraging annotated scRNA-seq datasets as a reference can significantly enhance clustering performance, enabling the identification of biologically meaningful clusters in target datasets. RESULTS: In this article, we propose Single Cell MUlti-Source CLustering (scMUSCL), a novel transfer learning method designed to identify cell clusters in a target dataset by leveraging knowledge from multiple annotated reference datasets. scMUSCL employs a deep neural network to extract domain- and batch-invariant cell representations, effectively addressing discrepancies across various source datasets and between source and target datasets within the new representation space. Unlike existing methods, scMUSCL does not require prior knowledge of the number of clusters in the target dataset and eliminates the need for batch correction between source and target datasets. We conduct extensive experiments using 20 real-life datasets, demonstrating that scMUSCL consistently outperforms existing unsupervised and transfer learning-based methods. Furthermore, our experiments show that scMUSCL benefits from multiple source datasets as learning references and accurately estimates the number of clusters. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The Python implementation of scMUSCL is available at https://github.com/arashkhoeini/scMUSCL.
34763709	2021	Genome biology	ATRX regulates glial identity and the tumor microenvironment in IDH-mutant glioma.	BACKGROUND: Recent single-cell transcriptomic studies report that IDH-mutant gliomas share a common hierarchy of cellular phenotypes, independent of genetic subtype. However, the genetic differences between IDH-mutant glioma subtypes are prognostic, predictive of response to chemotherapy, and correlate with distinct tumor microenvironments. RESULTS: To reconcile these findings, we profile 22 human IDH-mutant gliomas using scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq. We determine the cell-type-specific differences in transcription factor expression and associated regulatory grammars between IDH-mutant glioma subtypes. We find that while IDH-mutant gliomas do share a common distribution of cell types, there are significant differences in the expression and targeting of transcription factors that regulate glial identity and cytokine elaboration. We knock out the chromatin remodeler ATRX, which suffers loss-of-function alterations in most IDH-mutant astrocytomas, in an IDH-mutant immunocompetent intracranial murine model. We find that both human ATRX-mutant gliomas and murine ATRX-knockout gliomas are more heavily infiltrated by immunosuppressive monocytic-lineage cells derived from circulation than ATRX-intact gliomas, in an IDH-mutant background. ATRX knockout in murine glioma recapitulates gene expression and open chromatin signatures that are specific to human ATRX-mutant astrocytomas, including drivers of astrocytic lineage and immune-cell chemotaxis. Through single-cell cleavage under targets and tagmentation assays and meta-analysis of public data, we show that ATRX loss leads to a global depletion in CCCTC-binding factor association with DNA, gene dysregulation along associated chromatin loops, and protection from therapy-induced senescence. CONCLUSIONS: These studies explain how IDH-mutant gliomas from different subtypes maintain distinct phenotypes and tumor microenvironments despite a common lineage hierarchy.
35018408	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	A robust and scalable graph neural network for accurate single-cell classification.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) techniques provide high-resolution data on cellular heterogeneity in diverse tissues, and a critical step for the data analysis is cell type identification. Traditional methods usually cluster the cells and manually identify cell clusters through marker genes, which is time-consuming and subjective. With the launch of several large-scale single-cell projects, millions of sequenced cells have been annotated and it is promising to transfer labels from the annotated datasets to newly generated datasets. One powerful way for the transferring is to learn cell relations through the graph neural network (GNN), but traditional GNNs are difficult to process millions of cells due to the expensive costs of the message-passing procedure at each training epoch. Here, we have developed a robust and scalable GNN-based method for accurate single-cell classification (GraphCS), where the graph is constructed to connect similar cells within and between labelled and unlabeled scRNA-seq datasets for propagation of shared information. To overcome the slow information propagation of GNN at each training epoch, the diffused information is pre-calculated via the approximate Generalized PageRank algorithm, enabling sublinear complexity over cell numbers. Compared with existing methods, GraphCS demonstrates better performance on simulated, cross-platform, cross-species and cross-omics scRNA-seq datasets. More importantly, our model provides a high speed and scalability on large datasets, and can achieve superior performance for 1 million cells within 50 min.
40676652	2025	Genome biology	Sceptic: pseudotime analysis for time-series single-cell sequencing and imaging data.	Several computational methods have been developed to construct single-cell pseudotime embeddings for extracting the temporal order of transcriptional cell states from time-series scRNA-seq datasets. However, existing methods suffer from low predictive accuracy, and this problem becomes even worse when we try to generalize to other data types such as scATAC-seq or microscopy images. To address this problem, we propose Sceptic, a support vector machine model for supervised pseudotime analysis. We demonstrate that Sceptic achieves significantly improved prediction power relative to state-of-the-art methods, and that Sceptic can be applied to a variety of single-cell data types, including single-nucleus image data.
35361256	2022	Genome biology	Prime-seq, efficient and powerful bulk RNA sequencing.	Cost-efficient library generation by early barcoding has been central in propelling single-cell RNA sequencing. Here, we optimize and validate prime-seq, an early barcoding bulk RNA-seq method. We show that it performs equivalently to TruSeq, a standard bulk RNA-seq method, but is fourfold more cost-efficient due to almost 50-fold cheaper library costs. We also validate a direct RNA isolation step, show that intronic reads are derived from RNA, and compare cost-efficiencies of available protocols. We conclude that prime-seq is currently one of the best options to set up an early barcoding bulk RNA-seq protocol from which many labs would profit.
38281248	2024	Nucleic acids research	Decoding the universal human chromatin landscape through teratoma-based profiling.	Teratoma formation is key for evaluating differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into embryonic germ layers and serves as a model for understanding stem cell differentiation and developmental processes. Its potential for insights into epigenome and transcriptome profiling is significant. This study integrates the analysis of the epigenome and transcriptome of hESC-generated teratomas, comparing transcriptomes between hESCs and teratomas. It employs cell type-specific expression patterns from single-cell data to deconvolve RNA-Seq data and identify cell types within teratomas. Our results provide a catalog of activating and repressive histone modifications, while also elucidating distinctive features of chromatin states. Construction of an epigenetic signature matrix enabled the quantification of diverse cell populations in teratomas and enhanced the ability to unravel the epigenetic landscape in heterogeneous tissue contexts. This study also includes a single cell multiome atlas of expression (scRNA-Seq) and chromatin accessibility (scATAC-Seq) of human teratomas, further revealing the complexity of these tissues. A histology-based digital staining tool further complemented the annotation of cell types in teratomas, enhancing our understanding of their cellular composition. This research is a valuable resource for examining teratoma epigenomic and transcriptomic landscapes and serves as a model for epigenetic data comparison.
28418000	2017	Nature methods	SCnorm: robust normalization of single-cell RNA-seq data.	The normalization of RNA-seq data is essential for accurate downstream inference, but the assumptions upon which most normalization methods are based are not applicable in the single-cell setting. Consequently, applying existing normalization methods to single-cell RNA-seq data introduces artifacts that bias downstream analyses. To address this, we introduce SCnorm for accurate and efficient normalization of single-cell RNA-seq data.
39373053	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Detecting expressed genes in cell populations at the single-cell level with scGeneXpress.	Determining whether genes are expressed or not remains a challenge in single-cell RNAseq experiments due to their different expression spectra, which are influenced by genetics, the microenvironment and gene length. Current approaches for addressing this issue fail to provide a comprehensive landscape of expressed genes, since they neglect the inherent differences in the expression ranges and distributions of genes. Here, we present scGeneXpress, a method for detecting expressed genes in cell populations of single-cell RNAseq samples based on gene-specific reference distributions. We demonstrate that scGeneXpress accurately detects expressed cell markers and identity genes in 34 human and mouse tissues and can be employed to improve differential expression analysis of single-cell RNAseq data.
35012604	2022	Genome biology	Phiclust: a clusterability measure for single-cell transcriptomics reveals phenotypic subpopulations.	The ability to discover new cell phenotypes by unsupervised clustering of single-cell transcriptomes has revolutionized biology. Currently, there is no principled way to decide whether a cluster of cells contains meaningful subpopulations that should be further resolved. Here, we present phiclust (varphi(clust)), a clusterability measure derived from random matrix theory that can be used to identify cell clusters with non-random substructure, testably leading to the discovery of previously overlooked phenotypes.
34531539	2022	Nature biotechnology	Identifying transcriptional programs underlying cancer drug response with TraCe-seq.	Genetic and non-genetic heterogeneity within cancer cell populations represent major challenges to anticancer therapies. We currently lack robust methods to determine how preexisting and adaptive features affect cellular responses to therapies. Here, by conducting clonal fitness mapping and transcriptional characterization using expressed barcodes and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we have developed tracking differential clonal response by scRNA-seq (TraCe-seq). TraCe-seq is a method that captures at clonal resolution the origin, fate and differential early adaptive transcriptional programs of cells in a complex population in response to distinct treatments. We used TraCe-seq to benchmark how next-generation dual epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor-degraders compare to standard EGFR kinase inhibitors in EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells. We identified a loss of antigrowth activity associated with targeted degradation of EGFR protein and an essential role of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein processing pathway in anti-EGFR therapeutic efficacy. Our results suggest that targeted degradation is not always superior to enzymatic inhibition and establish TraCe-seq as an approach to study how preexisting transcriptional programs affect treatment responses.
39820437	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	scGO: interpretable deep neural network for cell status annotation and disease diagnosis.	"Machine learning has emerged as a transformative tool for elucidating cellular heterogeneity in single-cell RNA sequencing. However, a significant challenge lies in the ""black box"" nature of deep learning models, which obscures the decision-making process and limits interpretability in cell status annotation. In this study, we introduced scGO, a Gene Ontology (GO)-inspired deep learning framework designed to provide interpretable cell status annotation for scRNA-seq data. scGO employs sparse neural networks to leverage the intrinsic biological relationships among genes, transcription factors, and GO terms, significantly augmenting interpretability and reducing computational cost. scGO outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the precise characterization of cell subtypes across diverse datasets. Our extensive experimentation across a spectrum of scRNA-seq datasets underscored the remarkable efficacy of scGO in disease diagnosis, prediction of developmental stages, and evaluation of disease severity and cellular senescence status. Furthermore, we incorporated in silico individual gene manipulations into the scGO model, introducing an additional layer for discovering therapeutic targets. Our results provide an interpretable model for accurately annotating cell status, capturing latent biological knowledge, and informing clinical practice."
34908126	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	On the relation between input and output distributions of scRNA-seq experiments.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing determines RNA copy numbers per cell for a given gene. However, technical noise poses the question how observed distributions (output) are connected to their cellular distributions (input). RESULTS: We model a single-cell RNA sequencing setup consisting of PCR amplification and sequencing, and derive probability distribution functions for the output distribution given an input distribution. We provide copy number distributions arising from single transcripts during PCR amplification with exact expressions for mean and variance. We prove that the coefficient of variation of the output of sequencing is always larger than that of the input distribution. Experimental data reveals the variance and mean of the input distribution to obey characteristic relations, which we specifically determine for a HeLa dataset. We can calculate as many moments of the input distribution as are known of the output distribution (up to all). This, in principle, completely determines the input from the output distribution.

32747759	2020	Nature biotechnology	Generalizing RNA velocity to transient cell states through dynamical modeling.	RNA velocity has opened up new ways of studying cellular differentiation in single-cell RNA-sequencing data. It describes the rate of gene expression change for an individual gene at a given time point based on the ratio of its spliced and unspliced messenger RNA (mRNA). However, errors in velocity estimates arise if the central assumptions of a common splicing rate and the observation of the full splicing dynamics with steady-state mRNA levels are violated. Here we present scVelo, a method that overcomes these limitations by solving the full transcriptional dynamics of splicing kinetics using a likelihood-based dynamical model. This generalizes RNA velocity to systems with transient cell states, which are common in development and in response to perturbations. We apply scVelo to disentangling subpopulation kinetics in neurogenesis and pancreatic endocrinogenesis. We infer gene-specific rates of transcription, splicing and degradation, recover each cell's position in the underlying differentiation processes and detect putative driver genes. scVelo will facilitate the study of lineage decisions and gene regulation.
39673807	2025	Nucleic acids research	SLAM-seq reveals independent contributions of RNA processing and stability to gene expression in African trypanosomes.	Gene expression is a multi-step process that converts DNA-encoded information into proteins, involving RNA transcription, maturation, degradation, and translation. While transcriptional control is a major regulator of protein levels, the role of post-transcriptional processes such as RNA processing and degradation is less well understood due to the challenge of measuring their contributions individually. To address this challenge, we investigated the control of gene expression in Trypanosoma brucei, a unicellular parasite assumed to lack transcriptional control. Instead, mRNA levels in T. brucei are controlled by post-transcriptional processes, which enabled us to disentangle the contribution of both processes to total mRNA levels. In this study, we developed an efficient metabolic RNA labeling approach and combined ultra-short metabolic labeling with transient transcriptome sequencing (TT-seq) to confirm the long-standing assumption that RNA polymerase II transcription is unregulated in T. brucei. In addition, we established thiol (SH)-linked alkylation for metabolic sequencing of RNA (SLAM-seq) to globally quantify RNA processing rates and half-lives. Our data, combined with scRNA-seq data, indicate that RNA processing and stability independently affect total mRNA levels and contribute to the variability seen between individual cells in African trypanosomes.
37885016	2023	Genome biology	Pumping the brakes on RNA velocity by understanding and interpreting RNA velocity estimates.	BACKGROUND: RNA velocity analysis of single cells offers the potential to predict temporal dynamics from gene expression. In many systems, RNA velocity has been observed to produce a vector field that qualitatively reflects known features of the system. However, the limitations of RNA velocity estimates are still not well understood. RESULTS: We analyze the impact of different steps in the RNA velocity workflow on direction and speed. We consider both high-dimensional velocity estimates and low-dimensional velocity vector fields mapped onto an embedding. We conclude the transition probability method for mapping velocity estimates onto an embedding is effectively interpolating in the embedding space. Our findings reveal a significant dependence of the RNA velocity workflow on smoothing via the k-nearest-neighbors (k-NN) graph of the observed data. This reliance results in considerable estimation errors for both direction and speed in both high- and low-dimensional settings when the k-NN graph fails to accurately represent the true data structure; this is an unknown feature of real data. RNA velocity performs poorly at estimating speed in both low- and high-dimensional spaces, except in very low noise settings. We introduce a novel quality measure that can identify when RNA velocity should not be used. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings emphasize the importance of choices in the RNA velocity workflow and highlight critical limitations of data analysis. We advise against over-interpreting expression dynamics using RNA velocity, particularly in terms of speed. Finally, we emphasize that the use of RNA velocity in assessing the correctness of a low-dimensional embedding is circular.
35073331	2022	PLoS computational biology	Dynamic inference of cell developmental complex energy landscape from time series single-cell transcriptomic data.	Time series single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data are emerging. However, dynamic inference of an evolving cell population from time series scRNA-seq data is challenging owing to the stochasticity and nonlinearity of the underlying biological processes. This calls for the development of mathematical models and methods capable of reconstructing cellular dynamic transition processes and uncovering the nonlinear cell-cell interactions. In this study, we present GraphFP, a nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation on graph based model and dynamic inference framework, with the aim of reconstructing the cell state-transition complex potential energy landscape from time series single-cell transcriptomic data. The free energy of our model explicitly takes into account of the cell-cell interactions in a nonlinear quadratic term. We then recast the model inference problem in the form of a dynamic optimal transport framework and solve it efficiently with the adjoint method of optimal control. We evaluated GraphFP on the time series scRNA-seq data set of embryonic murine cerebral cortex development. We illustrated that it 1) reconstructs cell state potential energy, which is a measure of cellular differentiation potency, 2) faithfully charts the probability flows between paired cell states over the dynamic processes of cell differentiation, and 3) accurately quantifies the stochastic dynamics of cell type frequencies on probability simplex in continuous time. We also illustrated that GraphFP is robust in terms of cluster labelling with different resolutions, as well as parameter choices. Meanwhile, GraphFP provides a model-based approach to delineate the cell-cell interactions that drive cell differentiation. GraphFP software is available at https://github.com/QiJiang-QJ/GraphFP.
40576031	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Evaluating discrepancies in dimensionality reduction for time-series single-cell RNA-sequencing data.	There are various dimensionality reduction techniques for visually inspecting dynamical patterns in time-series single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. However, the lack of one-to-one correspondence between cells across time points makes it difficult to uniquely uncover temporal structure in a low-dimensional manifold. The use of different techniques may thus lead to discrepancies in the representation of dynamical patterns. However, The extent of these discrepancies remains unclear. To investigate this, we propose an approach for reasoning about such discrepancies based on synthetic time-series scRNA-seq data generated by variational autoencoders. The synthetic dynamical patterns induced in a low-dimensional manifold reflect biologically plausible temporal patterns, such as dividing cell clusters during a differentiation process. We consider manifolds from different dimensionality reduction techniques, such as principal component analysis, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding, uniform manifold approximation, and projection and single-cell variational inference. We illustrate how the proposed approach allows for reasoning about to what extent low-dimensional manifolds, obtained from different techniques, can capture different dynamical patterns. None of these techniques was found to be consistently superior and the results indicate that they may not reliably represent dynamics when used in isolation, underscoring the need to compare multiple perspectives. Thus, the proposed synthetic dynamical pattern approach provides a foundation for guiding future methods development to detect complex patterns in time-series scRNA-seq data.
39417321	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	scMGATGRN: a multiview graph attention network-based method for inferring gene regulatory networks from single-cell transcriptomic data.	The gene regulatory network (GRN) plays a vital role in understanding the structure and dynamics of cellular systems, revealing complex regulatory relationships, and exploring disease mechanisms. Recently, deep learning (DL)-based methods have been proposed to infer GRNs from single-cell transcriptomic data and achieved impressive performance. However, these methods do not fully utilize graph topological information and high-order neighbor information from multiple receptive fields. To overcome those limitations, we propose a novel model based on multiview graph attention network, namely, scMGATGRN, to infer GRNs. scMGATGRN mainly consists of GAT, multiview, and view-level attention mechanism. GAT can extract essential features of the gene regulatory network. The multiview model can simultaneously utilize local feature information and high-order neighbor feature information of nodes in the gene regulatory network. The view-level attention mechanism dynamically adjusts the relative importance of node embedding representations and efficiently aggregates node embedding representations from two views. To verify the effectiveness of scMGATGRN, we compared its performance with 10 methods (five shallow learning algorithms and five state-of-the-art DL-based methods) on seven benchmark single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets from five cell lines (two in human and three in mouse) with four different kinds of ground-truth networks. The experimental results not only show that scMGATGRN outperforms competing methods but also demonstrate the potential of this model in inferring GRNs. The code and data of scMGATGRN are made freely available on GitHub (https://github.com/nathanyl/scMGATGRN).
36342203	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Vaeda computationally annotates doublets in single-cell RNA sequencing data.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) continues to expand our knowledge by facilitating the study of transcriptional heterogeneity at the level of single cells. Despite this technology's utility and success in biomedical research, technical artifacts are present in scRNA-seq data. Doublets/multiplets are a type of artifact that occurs when two or more cells are tagged by the same barcode, and therefore they appear as a single cell. Because this introduces non-existent transcriptional profiles, doublets can bias and mislead downstream analysis. To address this limitation, computational methods to annotate and remove doublets form scRNA-seq datasets are needed. RESULTS: We introduce vaeda (Variational Auto-Encoder for Doublet Annotation), a new approach for computational annotation of doublets in scRNA-seq data. Vaeda integrates a variational auto-encoder and Positive-Unlabeled learning to produce doublet scores and binary doublet calls. We apply vaeda, along with seven existing doublet annotation methods, to 16 benchmark datasets and find that vaeda performs competitively in terms of doublet scores and doublet calls. Notably, vaeda outperforms other python-based methods for doublet annotation. Altogether, vaeda is a robust and competitive method for scRNA-seq doublet annotation and may be of particular interest in the context of python-based workflows. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Vaeda is available at https://github.com/kostkalab/vaeda, and the version used for the results we present here is archived at zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7199783). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
38416795	2024	PLoS computational biology	Quantifying the clusterness and trajectoriness of single-cell RNA-seq data.	"Among existing computational algorithms for single-cell RNA-seq analysis, clustering and trajectory inference are two major types of analysis that are routinely applied. For a given dataset, clustering and trajectory inference can generate vastly different visualizations that lead to very different interpretations of the data. To address this issue, we propose multiple scores to quantify the ""clusterness"" and ""trajectoriness"" of single-cell RNA-seq data, in other words, whether the data looks like a collection of distinct clusters or a continuum of progression trajectory. The scores we introduce are based on pairwise distance distribution, persistent homology, vector magnitude, Ripley's K, and degrees of connectivity. Using simulated datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed scores are able to effectively differentiate between cluster-like data and trajectory-like data. Using real single-cell RNA-seq datasets, we demonstrate the scores can serve as indicators of whether clustering analysis or trajectory inference is a more appropriate choice for biological interpretation of the data."
34233007	2021	Nucleic acids research	Single-cell nucleic acid profiling in droplets (SNAPD) enables high-throughput analysis of heterogeneous cell populations.	Experimental methods that capture the individual properties of single cells are revealing the key role of cell-to-cell variability in countless biological processes. These single-cell methods are becoming increasingly important across the life sciences in fields such as immunology, regenerative medicine and cancer biology. In addition to high-dimensional transcriptomic techniques such as single-cell RNA sequencing, there is a need for fast, simple and high-throughput assays to enumerate cell samples based on RNA biomarkers. In this work, we present single-cell nucleic acid profiling in droplets (SNAPD) to analyze sets of transcriptional markers in tens of thousands of single mammalian cells. Individual cells are encapsulated in aqueous droplets on a microfluidic chip and the RNA markers in each cell are amplified. Molecular logic circuits then integrate these amplicons to categorize cells based on the transcriptional markers and produce a detectable fluorescence output. SNAPD is capable of analyzing over 100,000 cells per hour and can be used to quantify distinct cell types within heterogeneous populations, detect rare cells at frequencies down to 0.1% and enrich specific cell types using microfluidic sorting. SNAPD provides a simple, rapid, low cost and scalable approach to study complex phenotypes in heterogeneous cell populations.
34353340	2021	Genome biology	Specific splice junction detection in single cells with SICILIAN.	Precise splice junction calls are currently unavailable in scRNA-seq pipelines such as the 10x Chromium platform but are critical for understanding single-cell biology. Here, we introduce SICILIAN, a new method that assigns statistical confidence to splice junctions from a spliced aligner to improve precision. SICILIAN is a general method that can be applied to bulk or single-cell data, but has particular utility for single-cell analysis due to that data's unique challenges and opportunities for discovery. SICILIAN's precise splice detection achieves high accuracy on simulated data, improves concordance between matched single-cell and bulk datasets, and increases agreement between biological replicates. SICILIAN detects unannotated splicing in single cells, enabling the discovery of novel splicing regulation through single-cell analysis workflows.
40116657	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	MOSim: bulk and single-cell multilayer regulatory network simulator.	As multi-omics sequencing technologies advance, the need for simulation tools capable of generating realistic and diverse (bulk and single-cell) multi-omics datasets for method testing and benchmarking becomes increasingly important. We present MOSim, an R package that simulates both bulk (via mosim function) and single-cell (via sc_mosim function) multi-omics data. The mosim function generates bulk transcriptomics data (RNA-seq) and additional regulatory omics layers (ATAC-seq, miRNA-seq, ChIP-seq, Methyl-seq, and transcription factors), while sc_mosim simulates single-cell transcriptomics data (scRNA-seq) with scATAC-seq and transcription factors as regulatory layers. The tool supports various experimental designs, including simulation of gene co-expression patterns, biological replicates, and differential expression between conditions. MOSim enables users to generate quantification matrices for each simulated omics data type, capturing the heterogeneity and complexity of bulk and single-cell multi-omics datasets. Furthermore, MOSim provides differentially abundant features within each omics layer and elucidates the active regulatory relationships between regulatory omics and gene expression data at both bulk and single-cell levels. By leveraging MOSim, researchers will be able to generate realistic and customizable bulk and single-cell multi-omics datasets to benchmark and validate analytical methods specifically designed for the integrative analysis of diverse regulatory omics data.

35048125	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	Comprehensive evaluation of noise reduction methods for single-cell RNA sequencing data.	Normalization and batch correction are critical steps in processing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, which remove technical effects and systematic biases to unmask biological signals of interest. Although a number of computational methods have been developed, there is no guidance for choosing appropriate procedures in different scenarios. In this study, we assessed the performance of 28 scRNA-seq noise reduction procedures in 55 scenarios using simulated and real datasets. The scenarios accounted for multiple biological and technical factors that greatly affect the denoising performance, including relative magnitude of batch effects, the extent of cell population imbalance, the complexity of cell group structures, the proportion and the similarity of nonoverlapping cell populations, dropout rates and variable library sizes. We used multiple quantitative metrics and visualization of low-dimensional cell embeddings to evaluate the performance on batch mixing while preserving the original cell group and gene structures. Based on our results, we specified technical or biological factors affecting the performance of each method and recommended proper methods in different scenarios. In addition, we highlighted one challenging scenario where most methods failed and resulted in overcorrection. Our studies not only provided a comprehensive guideline for selecting suitable noise reduction procedures but also pointed out unsolved issues in the field, especially the urgent need of developing metrics for assessing batch correction on imperceptible cell-type mixing.
40390047	2025	Genome biology	The gene regulatory mechanisms shaping the heterogeneity of venom production in the Cape coral snake.	BACKGROUND: Venoms and their associated glands and delivery structures have evolved numerous times among animals. Within these venom systems, the molecular, cellular, and morphological components interact and co-evolve to generate distinct, venom phenotypes that are increasingly recognized as models for studying adaptive evolution. However, toxins are often unevenly distributed across venom-producing tissues in patterns that are not necessarily adaptive but instead likely result from constraints associated with protein secretion. RESULTS: We generate a high-quality draft genome of the Cape coral snake (Aspidelaps lubricus) and combine analyses of venom gland single-cell RNA-seq data with spatial venom gland in situ toxin distributions. Our results reveal that while different toxin families are produced by distinct populations of cells, toxin expression is fine-tuned by regulatory modules that result in further specialization of toxin production within each cell population. We also find that the evolution of regulatory elements closely mirrors the evolution of their associated toxin genes, resulting in spatial association of closely related and functionally similar toxins in the venom gland. While this compartmentalization is non-adaptive, the modularity of the underlying regulatory network likely facilitated the repeated evolution of defensive venom in spitting cobras. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide new insight into the variability of toxin regulation across snakes, reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying the heterogeneous toxin production in snake venom glands, and provide an example of how constraints can result in non-adaptive character states that appear to be adaptive, which may nevertheless facilitate evolutionary innovation and novelty.
36095011	2022	PLoS computational biology	CINS: Cell Interaction Network inference from Single cell expression data.	Studies comparing single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) data between conditions mainly focus on differences in the proportion of cell types or on differentially expressed genes. In many cases these differences are driven by changes in cell interactions which are challenging to infer without spatial information. To determine cell-cell interactions that differ between conditions we developed the Cell Interaction Network Inference (CINS) pipeline. CINS combines Bayesian network analysis with regression-based modeling to identify differential cell type interactions and the proteins that underlie them. We tested CINS on a disease case control and on an aging mouse dataset. In both cases CINS correctly identifies cell type interactions and the ligands involved in these interactions improving on prior methods suggested for cell interaction predictions. We performed additional mouse aging scRNA-Seq experiments which further support the interactions identified by CINS.
37150778	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	CosTaL: an accurate and scalable graph-based clustering algorithm for high-dimensional single-cell data analysis.	With the aim of analyzing large-sized multidimensional single-cell datasets, we are describing a method for Cosine-based Tanimoto similarity-refined graph for community detection using Leiden's algorithm (CosTaL). As a graph-based clustering method, CosTaL transforms the cells with high-dimensional features into a weighted k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) graph. The cells are represented by the vertices of the graph, while an edge between two vertices in the graph represents the close relatedness between the two cells. Specifically, CosTaL builds an exact kNN graph using cosine similarity and uses the Tanimoto coefficient as the refining strategy to re-weight the edges in order to improve the effectiveness of clustering. We demonstrate that CosTaL generally achieves equivalent or higher effectiveness scores on seven benchmark cytometry datasets and six single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets using six different evaluation metrics, compared with other state-of-the-art graph-based clustering methods, including PhenoGraph, Scanpy and PARC. As indicated by the combined evaluation metrics, Costal has high efficiency with small datasets and acceptable scalability for large datasets, which is beneficial for large-scale analysis.
39230694	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scNODE : generative model for temporal single cell transcriptomic data prediction.	SUMMARY: Measurement of single-cell gene expression at different timepoints enables the study of cell development. However, due to the resource constraints and technical challenges associated with the single-cell experiments, researchers can only profile gene expression at discrete and sparsely sampled timepoints. This missing timepoint information impedes downstream cell developmental analyses. We propose scNODE, an end-to-end deep learning model that can predict in silico single-cell gene expression at unobserved timepoints. scNODE integrates a variational autoencoder with neural ordinary differential equations to predict gene expression using a continuous and nonlinear latent space. Importantly, we incorporate a dynamic regularization term to learn a latent space that is robust against distribution shifts when predicting single-cell gene expression at unobserved timepoints. Our evaluations on three real-world scRNA-seq datasets show that scNODE achieves higher predictive performance than state-of-the-art methods. We further demonstrate that scNODE's predictions help cell trajectory inference under the missing timepoint paradigm and the learned latent space is useful for in silico perturbation analysis of relevant genes along a developmental cell path. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/rsinghlab/scNODE.
38637899	2024	Genome biology	Library size confounds biology in spatial transcriptomics data.	Spatial molecular data has transformed the study of disease microenvironments, though, larger datasets pose an analytics challenge prompting the direct adoption of single-cell RNA-sequencing tools including normalization methods. Here, we demonstrate that library size is associated with tissue structure and that normalizing these effects out using commonly applied scRNA-seq normalization methods will negatively affect spatial domain identification. Spatial data should not be specifically corrected for library size prior to analysis, and algorithms designed for scRNA-seq data should be adopted with caution.
41212920	2025	PLoS computational biology	Splicing-aware scRNA-Seq resolution reveals execution-ready programs in effector Tregs.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) provides valuable insights into cell biology. However, current scRNA-Seq analytic approaches do not distinguish between spliced and unspliced mRNA at the level of dimensionality reduction. RNA velocity paradigm suggests that the presence of unspliced mRNA reflects transitional cell states, informative for studies of dynamic processes such as embryogenesis or tissue regeneration. Alternatively, stable cell subsets may also maintain translationally repressed spliced mRNA (e.g., in P-bodies) and/or unspliced mRNA reservoirs for prompt initiation of transcription-independent expression. Thus, functional cell subsets may differ not only in the current levels of actively produced mRNAs, but also in which mRNAs and in what forms are stored in the nucleus and cytoplasm. To enable splicing-aware analysis of scRNA-Seq data, we developed a method called SANSARA (Splicing-Aware scrNa-Seq AppRoAch). We employed SANSARA to characterize peripheral blood regulatory T cell (Treg) subsets, revealing a complementary interplay between the FOXP3 and Helios master transcription factors and high levels of spliced IL10RA, LGALS3, FCRL3, CD38, ITGAL, and LEF1 mRNAs in effector Tregs. Among Th1 and cytotoxic CD4+ T cell subsets, SANSARA also revealed substantial splicing heterogeneity across subset-specific genes. SANSARA is straightforward to implement in current data analysis pipelines and opens new dimensions for scRNA-Seq-based discoveries.
38706317	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Single-cell RNA sequencing data imputation using bi-level feature propagation.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables the exploration of cellular heterogeneity by analyzing gene expression profiles in complex tissues. However, scRNA-seq data often suffer from technical noise, dropout events and sparsity, hindering downstream analyses. Although existing works attempt to mitigate these issues by utilizing graph structures for data denoising, they involve the risk of propagating noise and fall short of fully leveraging the inherent data relationships, relying mainly on one of cell-cell or gene-gene associations and graphs constructed by initial noisy data. To this end, this study presents single-cell bilevel feature propagation (scBFP), two-step graph-based feature propagation method. It initially imputes zero values using non-zero values, ensuring that the imputation process does not affect the non-zero values due to dropout. Subsequently, it denoises the entire dataset by leveraging gene-gene and cell-cell relationships in the respective steps. Extensive experimental results on scRNA-seq data demonstrate the effectiveness of scBFP in various downstream tasks, uncovering valuable biological insights.
32650816	2020	Genome biology	DISC: a highly scalable and accurate inference of gene expression and structure for single-cell transcriptomes using semi-supervised deep learning.	Dropouts distort gene expression and misclassify cell types in single-cell transcriptome. Although imputation may improve gene expression and downstream analysis to some degree, it also inevitably introduces false signals. We develop DISC, a novel deep learning network with semi-supervised learning to infer gene structure and expression obscured by dropouts. Compared with seven state-of-the-art imputation approaches on ten real-world datasets, we show that DISC consistently outperforms the other approaches. Its applicability, scalability, and reliability make DISC a promising approach to recover gene expression, enhance gene and cell structures, and improve cell type identification for sparse scRNA-seq data.

39404057	2024	Nucleic acids research	Dual decoding of cell types and gene expression in spatial transcriptomics with PANDA.	Sequencing-based spatial transcriptomics technologies have revolutionized our understanding of complex biological systems by enabling transcriptome profiling while preserving spatial context. However, spot-level expression measurements often amalgamate signals from diverse cells, obscuring potential heterogeneity. Existing methods aim to deconvolute spatial transcriptomics data into cell type proportions for each spot using single-cell RNA sequencing references but overlook cell-type-specific gene expression, essential for uncovering intra-type heterogeneity. We present PANDA (ProbAbilistic-based decoNvolution with spot-aDaptive cell type signAtures), a novel method that concurrently deciphers spot-level gene expression into both cell type proportions and cell-type-specific gene expression. PANDA integrates archetypal analysis to capture within-cell-type heterogeneity and dynamically learns cell type signatures for each spot during deconvolution. Simulations demonstrate PANDA's superior performance. Applied to real spatial transcriptomics data from diverse tissues, including tumor, brain, and developing heart, PANDA reconstructs spatial structures and reveals subtle transcriptional variations within specific cell types, offering a comprehensive understanding of tissue dynamics.
38113074	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Model-based evaluation of spatiotemporal data reduction methods with unknown ground truth through optimal visualization and interpretability metrics.	Optimizing and benchmarking data reduction methods for dynamic or spatial visualization and interpretation (DSVI) face challenges due to many factors, including data complexity, lack of ground truth, time-dependent metrics, dimensionality bias and different visual mappings of the same data. Current studies often focus on independent static visualization or interpretability metrics that require ground truth. To overcome this limitation, we propose the MIBCOVIS framework, a comprehensive and interpretable benchmarking and computational approach. MIBCOVIS enhances the visualization and interpretability of high-dimensional data without relying on ground truth by integrating five robust metrics, including a novel time-ordered Markov-based structural metric, into a semi-supervised hierarchical Bayesian model. The framework assesses method accuracy and considers interaction effects among metric features. We apply MIBCOVIS using linear and nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods to evaluate optimal DSVI for four distinct dynamic and spatial biological processes captured by three single-cell data modalities: CyTOF, scRNA-seq and CODEX. These data vary in complexity based on feature dimensionality, unknown cell types and dynamic or spatial differences. Unlike traditional single-summary score approaches, MIBCOVIS compares accuracy distributions across methods. Our findings underscore the joint evaluation of visualization and interpretability, rather than relying on separate metrics. We reveal that prioritizing average performance can obscure method feature performance. Additionally, we explore the impact of data complexity on visualization and interpretability. Specifically, we provide optimal parameters and features and recommend methods, like the optimized variational contractive autoencoder, for targeted DSVI for various data complexities. MIBCOVIS shows promise for evaluating dynamic single-cell atlases and spatiotemporal data reduction models.
40294099	2025	PLoS computational biology	scPEDSSC: proximity enhanced deep sparse subspace clustering method for scRNA-seq data.	It is a significant step for single cell analysis to identify cell types through clustering single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. However, great challenges still remain due to the inherent high-dimensionality, noise, and sparsity of scRNA-seq data. In this study, scPEDSSC, a deep sparse subspace clustering method based on proximity enhancement, is put forward. The self-expression matrix (SEM), learned from the deep auto-encoder with two part generalized gamma (TPGG) distribution, are adopted to generate the similarity matrix along with its second power. Compared with eight state-of-the-art single-cell clustering methods on twelve real biological datasets, the proposed method scPEDSSC can achieve superior performance in most datasets, which has been verified through a number of experiments.
41237047	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	FastSCODE: an accelerated SCODE algorithm for inferring gene regulatory networks on manycore processors.	SUMMARY: SCODE reconstructs gene regulatory networks from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data using an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model, and has been successfully applied to a wide range of scRNA-seq datasets, including mouse, human, and plant cells. However, its computational performance is limited when processing large datasets due to its sequential execution flow and repeated optimization loops. To overcome this limitation, we have developed FastSCODE, a batch computing version of the SCODE algorithm optimized for acceleration on manycore processors such as GPUs. FastSCODE performs batch computation on multiple gene expression profiles and optimizes the parameters of a linear ODE model using manycore computing. Compared to the original implementation, FastSCODE achieves up to 6000x improvement in performance (from about one month to 10 minutes) on the CeNGEN scRNA-seq dataset when using multiple GPUs. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: FastSCODE is publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/cxinsys/fastscode.

35027767	2022	Nature methods	CellRank for directed single-cell fate mapping.	Computational trajectory inference enables the reconstruction of cell state dynamics from single-cell RNA sequencing experiments. However, trajectory inference requires that the direction of a biological process is known, largely limiting its application to differentiating systems in normal development. Here, we present CellRank ( https://cellrank.org ) for single-cell fate mapping in diverse scenarios, including regeneration, reprogramming and disease, for which direction is unknown. Our approach combines the robustness of trajectory inference with directional information from RNA velocity, taking into account the gradual and stochastic nature of cellular fate decisions, as well as uncertainty in velocity vectors. On pancreas development data, CellRank automatically detects initial, intermediate and terminal populations, predicts fate potentials and visualizes continuous gene expression trends along individual lineages. Applied to lineage-traced cellular reprogramming data, predicted fate probabilities correctly recover reprogramming outcomes. CellRank also predicts a new dedifferentiation trajectory during postinjury lung regeneration, including previously unknown intermediate cell states, which we confirm experimentally.

Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) techniques can reveal valuable insights of cell-to-cell heterogeneities. Projection of high-dimensional data into a low-dimensional subspace is a powerful strategy in general for mining such big data. However, scRNA-seq suffers from higher noise and lower coverage than traditional bulk RNA-seq, hence bringing in new computational difficulties. One major challenge is how to deal with the frequent drop-out events. The events, usually caused by the stochastic burst effect in gene transcription and the technical failure of RNA transcript capture, often render traditional dimension reduction methods work inefficiently. To overcome this problem, we have developed a novel Single Cell Representation Learning (SCRL) method based on network embedding. This method can efficiently implement data-driven non-linear projection and incorporate prior biological knowledge (such as pathway information) to learn more meaningful low-dimensional representations for both cells and genes. Benchmark results show that SCRL outperforms other dimensional reduction methods on several recent scRNA-seq datasets.
34601589	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Sciviewer enables interactive visual interrogation of single-cell RNA-Seq data from the Python programming environment.	MOTIVATION: Visualizing two-dimensional embeddings (such as UMAP or tSNE) is a useful step in interrogating single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data. Subsequently, users typically iterate between programmatic analyses (including clustering and differential expression) and visual exploration (e.g. coloring cells by interesting features) to uncover biological signals in the data. Interactive tools exist to facilitate visual exploration of embeddings such as performing differential expression on user-selected cells. However, the practical utility of these tools is limited because they don't support rapid movement of data and results to and from the programming environments where most of the data analysis takes place, interrupting the iterative process. RESULTS: Here, we present the Single-cell Interactive Viewer (Sciviewer), a tool that overcomes this limitation by allowing interactive visual interrogation of embeddings from within Python. Beyond differential expression analysis of user-selected cells, Sciviewer implements a novel method to identify genes varying locally along any user-specified direction on the embedding. Sciviewer enables rapid and flexible iteration between interactive and programmatic modes of scRNA-Seq exploration, illustrating a useful approach for analyzing high-dimensional data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Code and examples are provided at https://github.com/colabobio/sciviewer.
34193535	2021	Genome research	A Bayesian inference transcription factor activity model for the analysis of single-cell transcriptomes.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful experimental approach to study cellular heterogeneity. One of the challenges in scRNA-seq data analysis is integrating different types of biological data to consistently recognize discrete biological functions and regulatory mechanisms of cells, such as transcription factor activities and gene regulatory networks in distinct cell populations. We have developed an approach to infer transcription factor activities from scRNA-seq data that leverages existing biological data on transcription factor binding sites. The Bayesian inference transcription factor activity model (BITFAM) integrates ChIP-seq transcription factor binding information into scRNA-seq data analysis. We show that the inferred transcription factor activities for key cell types identify regulatory transcription factors that are known to mechanistically control cell function and cell fate. The BITFAM approach not only identifies biologically meaningful transcription factor activities, but also provides valuable insights into underlying transcription factor regulatory mechanisms.
38129866	2023	Genome biology	ENGEP: advancing spatial transcriptomics with accurate unmeasured gene expression prediction.	Imaging-based spatial transcriptomics techniques provide valuable spatial and gene expression information at single-cell resolution. However, their current capability is restricted to profiling a limited number of genes per sample, resulting in most of the transcriptome remaining unmeasured. To overcome this challenge, we develop ENGEP, an ensemble learning-based tool that predicts unmeasured gene expression in spatial transcriptomics data by using multiple single-cell RNA sequencing datasets as references. ENGEP outperforms current state-of-the-art tools and brings biological insight by accurately predicting unmeasured genes. ENGEP has exceptional efficiency in terms of runtime and memory usage, making it scalable for analyzing large datasets.
40053530	2025	PLoS computational biology	Penalised regression improves imputation of cell-type specific expression using RNA-seq data from mixed cell populations compared to domain-specific methods.	Gene expression studies often use bulk RNA sequencing of mixed cell populations because single cell or sorted cell sequencing may be prohibitively expensive. However, mixed cell studies may miss expression patterns that are restricted to specific cell populations. Computational deconvolution can be used to estimate cell fractions from bulk expression data and infer average cell-type expression in a set of samples (e.g., cases or controls), but imputing sample-level cell-type expression is required for more detailed analyses, such as relating expression to quantitative traits, and is less commonly addressed. Here, we assessed the accuracy of imputing sample-level cell-type expression using a real dataset where mixed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and sorted (CD4, CD8, CD14, CD19) RNA sequencing data were generated from the same subjects (N=158), and pseudobulk datasets synthesised from eQTLgen single cell RNA-seq data. We compared three domain-specific methods, CIBERSORTx, bMIND and debCAM/swCAM, and two cross-domain machine learning methods, multiple response LASSO and ridge, that had not been used for this task before. We also assessed the methods according to their ability to recover differential gene expression (DGE) results. LASSO/ridge showed higher sensitivity but lower specificity for recovering DGE signals seen in observed data compared to deconvolution methods, although LASSO/ridge had higher area under curves than deconvolution methods. Machine learning methods have the potential to outperform domain-specific methods when suitable training data are available.
28172415	2017	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	BASIC: BCR assembly from single cells.	MOTIVATION: The B-cell receptor enables individual B cells to identify diverse antigens, including bacterial and viral proteins. While advances in RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) have enabled high throughput profiling of transcript expression in single cells, the unique task of assembling the full-length heavy and light chain sequences from single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) in B cells has been largely unstudied. RESULTS: We developed a new software tool, BASIC, which allows investigators to use scRNA-seq for assembling BCR sequences at single-cell resolution. To demonstrate the utility of our software, we subjected nearly 200 single human B cells to scRNA-seq, assembled the full-length heavy and the light chains, and experimentally confirmed these results by using single-cell primer-based nested PCRs and Sanger sequencing. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: http://ttic.uchicago.edu/ approximately aakhan/BASIC CONTACT: aakhan@ttic.edu SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
34594043	2022	Nature biotechnology	Differential abundance testing on single-cell data using k-nearest neighbor graphs.	Current computational workflows for comparative analyses of single-cell datasets typically use discrete clusters as input when testing for differential abundance among experimental conditions. However, clusters do not always provide the appropriate resolution and cannot capture continuous trajectories. Here we present Milo, a scalable statistical framework that performs differential abundance testing by assigning cells to partially overlapping neighborhoods on a k-nearest neighbor graph. Using simulations and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, we show that Milo can identify perturbations that are obscured by discretizing cells into clusters, that it maintains false discovery rate control across batch effects and that it outperforms alternative differential abundance testing strategies. Milo identifies the decline of a fate-biased epithelial precursor in the aging mouse thymus and identifies perturbations to multiple lineages in human cirrhotic liver. As Milo is based on a cell-cell similarity structure, it might also be applicable to single-cell data other than scRNA-seq. Milo is provided as an open-source R software package at https://github.com/MarioniLab/miloR .
35709795	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	DURIAN: an integrative deconvolution and imputation method for robust signaling analysis of single-cell transcriptomics data.	Single-cell RNA sequencing trades read-depth for dimensionality, often leading to loss of critical signaling gene information that is typically present in bulk data sets. We introduce DURIAN (Deconvolution and mUltitask-Regression-based ImputAtioN), an integrative method for recovery of gene expression in single-cell data. Through systematic benchmarking, we demonstrate the accuracy, robustness and empirical convergence of DURIAN using both synthetic and published data sets. We show that use of DURIAN improves single-cell clustering, low-dimensional embedding, and recovery of intercellular signaling networks. Our study resolves several inconsistent results of cell-cell communication analysis using single-cell or bulk data independently. The method has broad application in biomarker discovery and cell signaling analysis using single-cell transcriptomics data sets.
38850160	2024	Nucleic acids research	CAbiNet: joint clustering and visualization of cells and genes for single-cell transcriptomics.	A fundamental analysis task for single-cell transcriptomics data is clustering with subsequent visualization of cell clusters. The genes responsible for the clustering are only inferred in a subsequent step. Clustering cells and genes together would be the remit of biclustering algorithms, which are often bogged down by the size of single-cell data. Here we present 'Correspondence Analysis based Biclustering on Networks' (CAbiNet) for joint clustering and visualization of single-cell RNA-sequencing data. CAbiNet performs efficient co-clustering of cells and their respective marker genes and jointly visualizes the biclusters in a non-linear embedding for easy and interactive visual exploration of the data.
36879008	2023	Nature biotechnology	High-resolution alignment of single-cell and spatial transcriptomes with CytoSPACE.	Recent studies have emphasized the importance of single-cell spatial biology, yet available assays for spatial transcriptomics have limited gene recovery or low spatial resolution. Here we introduce CytoSPACE, an optimization method for mapping individual cells from a single-cell RNA sequencing atlas to spatial expression profiles. Across diverse platforms and tissue types, we show that CytoSPACE outperforms previous methods with respect to noise tolerance and accuracy, enabling tissue cartography at single-cell resolution.
40439669	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Evaluation of out-of-distribution detection methods for data shifts in single-cell transcriptomics.	Automatic cell-type annotation methods assign cell-type labels to new, unlabeled datasets by leveraging relationships from a reference RNA-seq atlas. However, new datasets may include labels absent from the reference dataset or exhibit feature distributions that diverge from it. These scenarios can significantly affect the reliability of cell type predictions, a factor often overlooked in current automatic annotation methods. The field of out-of-distribution detection (OOD), primarily focused on computer vision, addresses the identification of instances that differ from the training distribution. Therefore, the implementation of OOD methods in the context of novel cell type annotation and data shift detection for single-cell transcriptomics may enhance annotation accuracy and trustworthiness. We evaluate six OOD detection methods: LogitNorm, MC dropout, Deep Ensembles, Energy-based OOD, Deep NN, and Posterior networks, for their annotation and OOD detection performance in both synthetical and real-life application settings. We show that OOD detection methods can accurately identify novel cell types and demonstrate potential to detect significant data shifts in non-integrated datasets. Moreover, we find that integration of the OOD datasets does not interfere with OOD detection of novel cell types.
40415678	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	GAEDGRN: reconstruction of gene regulatory networks based on gravity-inspired graph autoencoders.	Reconstructing high-resolution gene regulatory networks (GRNs) based on single-cell RNA sequencing data provides an opportunity to gain insight into disease pathogenesis. At present, there are a large number of GRN reconstruction methods based on graph neural networks, and they can obtain excellent performance in GRN inference by extracting network structure features. However, most of these methods fail to fully exploit the directional characteristics or even ignore them when extracting network structural features. To this end, a novel framework called GAEDGRN is proposed based on gravity-inspired graph autoencoder (GIGAE) to infer potential causal relationships between genes. Among them, GIGAE can help us capture the complex directed network topology in GRN. Additionally, due to the uneven distribution of the latent vectors generated by the graph autoencoder, a random walk-based method is used to regularize the latent vectors learnt by the encoder. Furthermore, considering that some genes in GRN usually have a significant impact on biological functions, GAEDGRN designs a gene importance score calculation method and pays attention to genes with high importance in the process of GRN reconstruction. Experimental results on seven cell types of three GRN types show that GAEDGRN achieves high accuracy and strong robustness. Moreover, a case study on human embryonic stem cells demonstrates that GAEDGRN can help identify important genes.
41125796	2025	Nature methods	scooby: modeling multimodal genomic profiles from DNA sequence at single-cell resolution.	Understanding how regulatory sequences shape gene expression across individual cells is a fundamental challenge in genomics. Joint RNA sequencing and epigenomic profiling provides opportunities to build models capturing sequence determinants across steps of gene expression. However, current models, developed primarily for bulk omics data, fail to capture the cellular heterogeneity and dynamic processes revealed by single-cell multimodal technologies. Here, we introduce scooby, a framework to model genomic profiles of single-cell RNA-sequencing coverage and single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing insertions from sequence at single-cell resolution. For this, we leverage the pretrained multiomics profile predictor Borzoi and equip it with a cell-specific decoder. Scooby recapitulates cell-specific expression levels of held-out genes and identifies regulators and their putative target genes. Moreover, scooby allows resolving single-cell effects of bulk expression quantitative trait loci and delineating their impact on chromatin accessibility and gene expression. We anticipate scooby to aid unraveling the complexities of gene regulation at the resolution of individual cells.
37730638	2023	Genome biology	DISCERN: deep single-cell expression reconstruction for improved cell clustering and cell subtype and state detection.	BACKGROUND: Single-cell sequencing provides detailed insights into biological processes including cell differentiation and identity. While providing deep cell-specific information, the method suffers from technical constraints, most notably a limited number of expressed genes per cell, which leads to suboptimal clustering and cell type identification. RESULTS: Here, we present DISCERN, a novel deep generative network that precisely reconstructs missing single-cell gene expression using a reference dataset. DISCERN outperforms competing algorithms in expression inference resulting in greatly improved cell clustering, cell type and activity detection, and insights into the cellular regulation of disease. We show that DISCERN is robust against differences between batches and is able to keep biological differences between batches, which is a common problem for imputation and batch correction algorithms. We use DISCERN to detect two unseen COVID-19-associated T cell types, cytotoxic CD4(+) and CD8(+) Tc2 T helper cells, with a potential role in adverse disease outcome. We utilize T cell fraction information of patient blood to classify mild or severe COVID-19 with an AUROC of 80% that can serve as a biomarker of disease stage. DISCERN can be easily integrated into existing single-cell sequencing workflow. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, DISCERN is a flexible tool for reconstructing missing single-cell gene expression using a reference dataset and can easily be applied to a variety of data sets yielding novel insights, e.g., into disease mechanisms.
34891154	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	Tumor immune microenvironment lncRNAs.	Long non-coding ribonucleic acids (RNAs) (lncRNAs) are key players in tumorigenesis and immune responses. The nature of their cell type-specific gene expression and other functional evidence support the idea that lncRNAs have distinct cellular functions in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). To date, the majority of lncRNA studies have heavily relied on bulk RNA-sequencing data in which various cell types contribute to an averaged signal, limiting the discovery of cell type-specific lncRNA functions. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a potential solution for tackling this limitation despite the lack of annotations for low abundance yet cell type-specific lncRNAs. Hence, updated annotations and further understanding of the cellular expression of lncRNAs will be necessary for characterizing cell type-specific functions of lncRNA genes in the TIME. In this review, we discuss lncRNAs that are specifically expressed in tumor and immune cells, summarize the regulatory functions of the lncRNAs at the cell type level and highlight how a scRNA-seq approach can help to study the cell type-specific functions of TIME lncRNAs.
32690972	2021	Nature biotechnology	Cell type prioritization in single-cell data.	We present Augur, a method to prioritize the cell types most responsive to biological perturbations in single-cell data. Augur employs a machine-learning framework to quantify the separability of perturbed and unperturbed cells within a high-dimensional space. We validate our method on single-cell RNA sequencing, chromatin accessibility and imaging transcriptomics datasets, and show that Augur outperforms existing methods based on differential gene expression. Augur identified the neural circuits restoring locomotion in mice following spinal cord neurostimulation.
27497440	2016	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scphaser: haplotype inference using single-cell RNA-seq data.	Determination of haplotypes is important for modelling the phenotypic consequences of genetic variation in diploid organisms, including cis-regulatory control and compound heterozygosity. We realized that single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data are well suited for phasing genetic variants, since both transcriptional bursts and technical bottlenecks cause pronounced allelic fluctuations in individual single cells. Here we present scphaser, an R package that phases alleles at heterozygous variants to reconstruct haplotypes within transcribed regions of the genome using scRNA-seq data. The devised method efficiently and accurately reconstructed the known haplotype for >/=93% of phasable genes in both human and mouse. It also enables phasing of rare and de novo variants and variants far apart within genes, which is hard to attain with population-based computational inference. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: scphaser is implemented as an R package. Tutorial and code are available at https://github.com/edsgard/scphaser CONTACT: rickard.sandberg@ki.se SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
38828640	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	A hybrid demultiplexing strategy that improves performance and robustness of cell hashing.	Cell hashing, a nucleotide barcode-based method that allows users to pool multiple samples and demultiplex in downstream analysis, has gained widespread popularity in single-cell sequencing due to its compatibility, simplicity, and cost-effectiveness. Despite these advantages, the performance of this method remains unsatisfactory under certain circumstances, especially in experiments that have imbalanced sample sizes or use many hashtag antibodies. Here, we introduce a hybrid demultiplexing strategy that increases accuracy and cell recovery in multi-sample single-cell experiments. This approach correlates the results of cell hashing and genetic variant clustering, enabling precise and efficient cell identity determination without additional experimental costs or efforts. In addition, we developed HTOreader, a demultiplexing tool for cell hashing that improves the accuracy of cut-off calling by avoiding the dominance of negative signals in experiments with many hashtags or imbalanced sample sizes. When compared to existing methods using real-world datasets, this hybrid approach and HTOreader consistently generate reliable results with increased accuracy and cell recovery.
36690742	2023	Nature methods	Screening cell-cell communication in spatial transcriptomics via collective optimal transport.	Spatial transcriptomic technologies and spatially annotated single-cell RNA sequencing datasets provide unprecedented opportunities to dissect cell-cell communication (CCC). However, incorporation of the spatial information and complex biochemical processes required in the reconstruction of CCC remains a major challenge. Here, we present COMMOT (COMMunication analysis by Optimal Transport) to infer CCC in spatial transcriptomics, which accounts for the competition between different ligand and receptor species as well as spatial distances between cells. A collective optimal transport method is developed to handle complex molecular interactions and spatial constraints. Furthermore, we introduce downstream analysis tools to infer spatial signaling directionality and genes regulated by signaling using machine learning models. We apply COMMOT to simulation data and eight spatial datasets acquired with five different technologies to show its effectiveness and robustness in identifying spatial CCC in data with varying spatial resolutions and gene coverages. Finally, COMMOT identifies new CCCs during skin morphogenesis in a case study of human epidermal development.
34864849	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Isoform-level quantification for single-cell RNA sequencing.	MOTIVATION: RNA expression at isoform level is biologically more informative than at gene level and can potentially reveal cellular subsets and corresponding biomarkers that are not visible at gene level. However, due to the strong 3' bias sequencing protocol, mRNA quantification for high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing such as Chromium Single Cell 3' 10x Genomics is currently performed at the gene level. RESULTS: We have developed an isoform-level quantification method for high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing by exploiting the concepts of transcription clusters and isoform paralogs. The method, called Scasa, compares well in simulations against competing approaches including Alevin, Cellranger, Kallisto, Salmon, Terminus and STARsolo at both isoform- and gene-level expression. The reanalysis of a CITE-Seq dataset with isoform-based Scasa reveals a subgroup of CD14 monocytes missed by gene-based methods. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Implementation of Scasa including source code, documentation, tutorials and test data supporting this study is available at Github: https://github.com/eudoraleer/scasa and Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5712503.

40689508	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	IGCLAPS: an interpretable graph contrastive learning method with adaptive positive sampling for scRNA-seq data analysis.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology enables biological research at single-cell resolution. Cell clustering is a crucial task in scRNA-seq data analysis since it provides insights into cell heterogeneity. Although existing methods have made significant progress in this task, it remains challenging to fully utilize the relationship among cells. RESULTS: We propose Interpretable Graph Contrastive Learning method with Adaptive Positive Sampling (IGCLAPS), a novel end-to-end graph contrastive clustering method for scRNA-seq data analysis. Specifically, IGCLAPS learns low-dimensional embeddings with a graph transformer, based on which a dual-head graph contrastive learning module is used to perform dimension reduction and cell clustering simultaneously. Besides, an accurate definition of positive sample pairs is crucial in contrastive learning, we devise an adaptive positive sampling module, which dynamically identifies true positive sample pairs based on both expression similarity and soft cluster labels generated by the contrastive learning module. Extensive experiments on a series of real datasets including cell clustering, visualization, and differential expression analysis demonstrate that IGCLAPS can effectively enhance clustering performance and generate interpretable gene expression patterns of scRNA-seq data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source codes of IGCLAPS are available at https://github.com/ZhengWeihuaYNU/IGCLAPS.
38145950	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	CAKE: a flexible self-supervised framework for enhancing cell visualization, clustering and rare cell identification.	Single cell sequencing technology has provided unprecedented opportunities for comprehensively deciphering cell heterogeneity. Nevertheless, the high dimensionality and intricate nature of cell heterogeneity have presented substantial challenges to computational methods. Numerous novel clustering methods have been proposed to address this issue. However, none of these methods achieve the consistently better performance under different biological scenarios. In this study, we developed CAKE, a novel and scalable self-supervised clustering method, which consists of a contrastive learning model with a mixture neighborhood augmentation for cell representation learning, and a self-Knowledge Distiller model for the refinement of clustering results. These designs provide more condensed and cluster-friendly cell representations and improve the clustering performance in term of accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, in addition to accurately identifying the major type cells, CAKE could also find more biologically meaningful cell subgroups and rare cell types. The comprehensive experiments on real single-cell RNA sequencing datasets demonstrated the superiority of CAKE in visualization and clustering over other comparison methods, and indicated its extensive application in the field of cell heterogeneity analysis.

34872616	2021	Genome biology	geneBasis: an iterative approach for unsupervised selection of targeted gene panels from scRNA-seq.	scRNA-seq datasets are increasingly used to identify gene panels that can be probed using alternative technologies, such as spatial transcriptomics, where choosing the best subset of genes is vital. Existing methods are limited by a reliance on pre-existing cell type labels or by difficulties in identifying markers of rare cells. We introduce an iterative approach, geneBasis, for selecting an optimal gene panel, where each newly added gene captures the maximum distance between the true manifold and the manifold constructed using the currently selected gene panel. Our approach outperforms existing strategies and can resolve cell types and subtle cell state differences.
40098239	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	mastR: an R package for automated identification of tissue-specific gene signatures in multi-group differential expression analysis.	MOTIVATION: Biomarker discovery is important and offers insight into potential underlying mechanisms of disease. While existing biomarker identification methods primarily focus on single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, there remains a need for automated methods designed for labeled bulk RNA-seq data from sorted cell populations or experiments. Current methods require curation of results or statistical thresholds and may not account for tissue background expression. Here we bridge these limitations with an automated marker identification method for labeled bulk RNA-seq data that explicitly considers background expressions. RESULTS: We developed mastR, a novel tool for accurate marker identification using transcriptomic data. It leverages robust statistical pipelines like edgeR and limma to perform pairwise comparisons between groups, and aggregates results using rank-product-based permutation test. A signal-to-noise ratio approach is implemented to minimize background signals. We assessed the performance of mastR-derived NK cell signatures against published curated signatures and found that the mastR-derived signature performs as well, if not better than the published signatures. We further demonstrated the utility of mastR on simulated scRNA-seq data and in comparison with Seurat in terms of marker selection performance. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: mastR is freely available from https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/mastR.html. A vignette and guide are available at https://davislaboratory.github.io/mastR. All statistical analyses were carried out using R (version >/=4.3.0) and Bioconductor (version >/=3.17).
30482222	2018	Genome biology	Linking single-cell measurements of mass, growth rate, and gene expression.	Mass and growth rate are highly integrative measures of cell physiology not discernable via genomic measurements. Here, we introduce a microfluidic platform enabling direct measurement of single-cell mass and growth rate upstream of highly multiplexed single-cell profiling such as single-cell RNA sequencing. We resolve transcriptional signatures associated with single-cell mass and growth rate in L1210 and FL5.12 cell lines and activated CD8+ T cells. Further, we demonstrate a framework using these linked measurements to characterize biophysical heterogeneity in a patient-derived glioblastoma cell line with and without drug treatment. Our results highlight the value of coupled phenotypic metrics in guiding single-cell genomics.
37559123	2023	Genome biology	LAST-seq: single-cell RNA sequencing by direct amplification of single-stranded RNA without prior reverse transcription and second-strand synthesis.	Existing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) methods rely on reverse transcription (RT) and second-strand synthesis (SSS) to convert single-stranded RNA into double-stranded DNA prior to amplification, with the limited RT/SSS efficiency compromising RNA detectability. Here, we develop a new scRNA-seq method, Linearly Amplified Single-stranded-RNA-derived Transcriptome sequencing (LAST-seq), which directly amplifies the original single-stranded RNA molecules without prior RT/SSS. LAST-seq offers a high single-molecule capture efficiency and a low level of technical noise for single-cell transcriptome analyses. Using LAST-seq, we characterize transcriptional bursting kinetics in human cells, revealing a role of topologically associating domains in transcription regulation.
35037026	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	hDirect-MAP: projection-free single-cell modeling of response to checkpoint immunotherapy.	There is a lack of robust generalizable predictive biomarkers of response to immune checkpoint blockade in multiple types of cancer. We develop hDirect-MAP, an algorithm that maps T cells into a shared high-dimensional (HD) expression space of diverse T cell functional signatures in which cells group by the common T cell phenotypes rather than dimensional reduced features or a distorted view of these features. Using projection-free single-cell modeling, hDirect-MAP first removed a large group of cells that did not contribute to response and then clearly distinguished T cells into response-specific subpopulations that were defined by critical T cell functional markers of strong differential expression patterns. We found that these grouped cells cannot be distinguished by dimensional-reduction algorithms but are blended by diluted expression patterns. Moreover, these identified response-specific T cell subpopulations enabled a generalizable prediction by their HD metrics. Tested using five single-cell RNA-seq or mass cytometry datasets from basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma, hDirect-MAP demonstrated common response-specific T cell phenotypes that defined a generalizable and accurate predictive biomarker.
29688277	2018	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	DEsingle for detecting three types of differential expression in single-cell RNA-seq data.	SUMMARY: The excessive amount of zeros in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data includes 'real' zeros due to the on-off nature of gene transcription in single cells and 'dropout' zeros due to technical reasons. Existing differential expression (DE) analysis methods cannot distinguish these two types of zeros. We developed an R package DEsingle which employed Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial model to estimate the proportion of real and dropout zeros and to define and detect three types of DE genes in scRNA-seq data with higher accuracy. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The R package DEsingle is freely available at Bioconductor (https://bioconductor.org/packages/DEsingle). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
38635836	2024	PLoS computational biology	Ranking of cell clusters in a single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis framework using prior knowledge.	Prioritization or ranking of different cell types in a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) framework can be performed in a variety of ways, some of these include: i) obtaining an indication of the proportion of cell types between the different conditions under study, ii) counting the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between cell types and conditions in the experiment or, iii) prioritizing cell types based on prior knowledge about the conditions under study (i.e., a specific disease). These methods have drawbacks and limitations thus novel methods for improving cell ranking are required. Here we present a novel methodology that exploits prior knowledge in combination with expert-user information to accentuate cell types from a scRNA-seq analysis that yield the most biologically meaningful results with respect to a disease under study. Our methodology allows for ranking and prioritization of cell types based on how well their expression profiles relate to the molecular mechanisms and drugs associated with a disease. Molecular mechanisms, as well as drugs, are incorporated as prior knowledge in a standardized, structured manner. Cell types are then ranked/prioritized based on how well results from data-driven analysis of scRNA-seq data match the predefined prior knowledge. In additional cell-cell communication perturbations between disease and control networks are used to further prioritize/rank cell types. Our methodology has substantial advantages to more traditional cell ranking techniques and provides an informative complementary methodology that utilizes prior knowledge in a rapid and automated manner, that has previously not been attempted by other studies. The current methodology is also implemented as an R package entitled Single Cell Ranking Analysis Toolkit (scRANK) and is available for download and installation via GitHub (https://github.com/aoulas/scRANK).
37827697	2023	Genome research	ESICCC as a systematic computational framework for evaluation, selection, and integration of cell-cell communication inference methods.	Cell-cell communication (CCC) is critical for determining cell fates and functions in multicellular organisms. With the advent of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics (ST), an increasing number of CCC inference methods have been developed. Nevertheless, a thorough comparison of their performances is yet to be conducted. To fill this gap, we developed a systematic benchmark framework called ESICCC to evaluate 18 ligand-receptor (LR) inference methods and five ligand/receptor-target inference methods using a total of 116 data sets, including 15 ST data sets, 15 sets of cell line perturbation data, two sets of cell type-specific expression/proteomics data, and 84 sets of sampled or unsampled scRNA-seq data. We evaluated and compared the agreement, accuracy, robustness, and usability of these methods. Regarding accuracy evaluation, RNAMagnet, CellChat, and scSeqComm emerge as the three best-performing methods for intercellular ligand-receptor inference based on scRNA-seq data, whereas stMLnet and HoloNet are the best methods for predicting ligand/receptor-target regulation using ST data. To facilitate the practical applications, we provide a decision-tree-style guideline for users to easily choose best tools for their specific research concerns in CCC inference, and develop an ensemble pipeline CCCbank that enables versatile combinations of methods and databases. Moreover, our comparative results also uncover several critical influential factors for CCC inference, such as prior interaction information, ligand-receptor scoring algorithm, intracellular signaling complexity, and spatial relationship, which may be considered in the future studies to advance the development of new methodologies.
40619422	2025	Genome biology	Systematic assessment of microenvironment-dependent transcriptional patterns and intercellular communication.	BACKGROUND: Understanding cell-cell communication and its dependence on spatial organization is critical for unraveling tissue complexity and organ function, and it has been demonstrated that cells are influenced by their microenvironment and neighboring cells, affecting their gene expression and intercellular interactions. This study integrates single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with spatial transcriptomics (ST) to systematically assess how spatial niches influence gene expression and intercellular communication. RESULTS: Using breast cancer, brain cortex, and heart datasets, our analyses reveal limited global transcriptional changes in cells depending on their spatial microenvironment, with differential gene expression observed in half of the samples explored. Moreover, cell-cell communication predictions, derived from ligand-receptor pairs, exhibit minimal correlation with spatial colocalization of cell types. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our study underscores the limitations of using scRNA-seq data to capture niche-specific molecular interactions, even when spatial information is leveraged, and it highlights the need for novel strategies to refine our understanding of intercellular communication dynamics at the molecular level.
32669109	2020	Genome biology	Single-cell lineage analysis reveals genetic and epigenetic interplay in glioblastoma drug resistance.	BACKGROUND: Tumors can evolve and adapt to therapeutic pressure by acquiring genetic and epigenetic alterations that may be transient or stable. A precise understanding of how such events contribute to intratumoral heterogeneity, dynamic subpopulations, and overall tumor fitness will require experimental approaches to prospectively label, track, and characterize resistant or otherwise adaptive populations at the single-cell level. In glioblastoma, poor efficacy of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) therapies has been alternatively ascribed to genetic heterogeneity or to epigenetic transitions that circumvent signaling blockade. RESULTS: We combine cell lineage barcoding and single-cell transcriptomics to trace the emergence of drug resistance in stem-like glioblastoma cells treated with RTK inhibitors. Whereas a broad variety of barcoded lineages adopt a Notch-dependent persister phenotype that sustains them through early drug exposure, rare subclones acquire genetic changes that enable their rapid outgrowth over time. Single-cell analyses reveal that these genetic subclones gain copy number amplifications of the insulin receptor substrate-1 and substrate-2 (IRS1 or IRS2) loci, which activate insulin and AKT signaling programs. Persister-like cells and genomic amplifications of IRS2 and other loci are evident in primary glioblastomas and may underlie the inefficacy of targeted therapies in this disease. CONCLUSIONS: A method for combined lineage tracing and scRNA-seq reveals the interplay between complementary genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of resistance in a heterogeneous glioblastoma tumor model.
30899105	2019	Nature biotechnology	Characterization of cell fate probabilities in single-cell data with Palantir.	Single-cell RNA sequencing studies of differentiating systems have raised fundamental questions regarding the discrete versus continuous nature of both differentiation and cell fate. Here we present Palantir, an algorithm that models trajectories of differentiating cells by treating cell fate as a probabilistic process and leverages entropy to measure cell plasticity along the trajectory. Palantir generates a high-resolution pseudo-time ordering of cells and, for each cell state, assigns a probability of differentiating into each terminal state. We apply our algorithm to human bone marrow single-cell RNA sequencing data and detect important landmarks of hematopoietic differentiation. Palantir's resolution enables the identification of key transcription factors that drive lineage fate choice and closely track when cells lose plasticity. We show that Palantir outperforms existing algorithms in identifying cell lineages and recapitulating gene expression trends during differentiation, is generalizable to diverse tissue types, and is well-suited to resolving less-studied differentiating systems.
28087841	2017	Genome research	Single-cell transcriptome analysis of fish immune cells provides insight into the evolution of vertebrate immune cell types.	The immune system of vertebrate species consists of many different cell types that have distinct functional roles and are subject to different evolutionary pressures. Here, we first analyzed conservation of genes specific for all major immune cell types in human and mouse. Our results revealed higher gene turnover and faster evolution of trans-membrane proteins in NK cells compared with other immune cell types, and especially T cells, but similar conservation of nuclear and cytoplasmic protein coding genes. To validate these findings in a distant vertebrate species, we used single-cell RNA sequencing of lck:GFP cells in zebrafish and obtained the first transcriptome of specific immune cell types in a nonmammalian species. Unsupervised clustering and single-cell TCR locus reconstruction identified three cell populations, T cells, a novel type of NK-like cells, and a smaller population of myeloid-like cells. Differential expression analysis uncovered new immune-cell-specific genes, including novel immunoglobulin-like receptors, and neofunctionalization of recently duplicated paralogs. Evolutionary analyses confirmed the higher gene turnover of trans-membrane proteins in NK cells compared with T cells in fish species, suggesting that this is a general property of immune cell types across all vertebrates.
38898465	2024	Genome biology	An integrated single-cell RNA-seq map of human neuroblastoma tumors and preclinical models uncovers divergent mesenchymal-like gene expression programs.	"BACKGROUND: Neuroblastoma is a common pediatric cancer, where preclinical studies suggest that a mesenchymal-like gene expression program contributes to chemotherapy resistance. However, clinical outcomes remain poor, implying we need a better understanding of the relationship between patient tumor heterogeneity and preclinical models. RESULTS: Here, we generate single-cell RNA-seq maps of neuroblastoma cell lines, patient-derived xenograft models (PDX), and a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM). We develop an unsupervised machine learning approach (""automatic consensus nonnegative matrix factorization"" (acNMF)) to compare the gene expression programs found in preclinical models to a large cohort of patient tumors. We confirm a weakly expressed, mesenchymal-like program in otherwise adrenergic cancer cells in some pre-treated high-risk patient tumors, but this appears distinct from the presumptive drug-resistance mesenchymal programs evident in cell lines. Surprisingly, however, this weak-mesenchymal-like program is maintained in PDX and could be chemotherapy-induced in our GEMM after only 24 h, suggesting an uncharacterized therapy-escape mechanism. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our findings improve the understanding of how neuroblastoma patient tumor heterogeneity is reflected in preclinical models, provides a comprehensive integrated resource, and a generalizable set of computational methodologies for the joint analysis of clinical and pre-clinical single-cell RNA-seq datasets."
30962620	2019	Nature methods	Evaluating measures of association for single-cell transcriptomics.	Single-cell transcriptomics provides an opportunity to characterize cell-type-specific transcriptional networks, intercellular signaling pathways and cellular diversity with unprecedented resolution by profiling thousands of cells in a single experiment. However, owing to the unique statistical properties of scRNA-seq data, the optimal measures of association for identifying gene-gene and cell-cell relationships from single-cell transcriptomics remain unclear. Here, we conducted a large-scale evaluation of 17 measures of association for their ability to reconstruct cellular networks, cluster cells of the same type and link cell-type-specific transcriptional programs to disease. Measures of proportionality were consistently among the best-performing methods across datasets and tasks. Our analysis provides data-driven guidance for gene and cell network analysis in single-cell transcriptomics.
35674381	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	WAT3R: recovery of T-cell receptor variable regions from 3' single-cell RNA-sequencing.	SUMMARY: Diversity of the T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire is central to adaptive immunity. The TCR is composed of alpha and beta chains, encoded by the TRA and TRB genes, of which the variable regions determine antigen specificity. To generate novel biological insights into the complex functioning of immune cells, combined capture of variable regions and single-cell transcriptomes provides a compelling approach. Recent developments enable the enrichment of TRA and TRB variable regions from widely used technologies for 3'-based single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). However, a comprehensive computational pipeline to process TCR-enriched data from 3' scRNA-seq is not available. Here, we present an analysis pipeline to process TCR variable regions enriched from 3' scRNA-seq cDNA. The tool reports TRA and TRB nucleotide and amino acid sequences linked to cell barcodes, enabling the reconstruction of T-cell clonotypes with associated transcriptomes. We demonstrate the software using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a healthy donor and detect TCR sequences in a high proportion of single T cells. Detection of TCR sequences is low in non-T-cell populations, demonstrating specificity. Finally, we show that TCR clones are larger in CD8 Memory T cells than in other T-cell types, indicating an association between T-cell clonotypes and differentiation states. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The Workflow for Association of T-cell receptors from 3' single-cell RNA-seq (WAT3R), including test data, is available on GitHub (https://github.com/mainciburu/WAT3R), Docker Hub (https://hub.docker.com/r/mainciburu/wat3r) and a workflow on the Terra platform (https://app.terra.bio). The test dataset is available on GEO (accession number GSE195956). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
27179027	2016	Nucleic acids research	TSCAN: Pseudo-time reconstruction and evaluation in single-cell RNA-seq analysis.	When analyzing single-cell RNA-seq data, constructing a pseudo-temporal path to order cells based on the gradual transition of their transcriptomes is a useful way to study gene expression dynamics in a heterogeneous cell population. Currently, a limited number of computational tools are available for this task, and quantitative methods for comparing different tools are lacking. Tools for Single Cell Analysis (TSCAN) is a software tool developed to better support in silico pseudo-Time reconstruction in Single-Cell RNA-seq ANalysis. TSCAN uses a cluster-based minimum spanning tree (MST) approach to order cells. Cells are first grouped into clusters and an MST is then constructed to connect cluster centers. Pseudo-time is obtained by projecting each cell onto the tree, and the ordered sequence of cells can be used to study dynamic changes of gene expression along the pseudo-time. Clustering cells before MST construction reduces the complexity of the tree space. This often leads to improved cell ordering. It also allows users to conveniently adjust the ordering based on prior knowledge. TSCAN has a graphical user interface (GUI) to support data visualization and user interaction. Furthermore, quantitative measures are developed to objectively evaluate and compare different pseudo-time reconstruction methods. TSCAN is available at https://github.com/zji90/TSCAN and as a Bioconductor package.
40903640	2025	Nature methods	Reproducible single-cell annotation of programs underlying T cell subsets, activation states and functions.	T cells recognize antigens and induce specialized gene expression programs (GEPs), enabling functions like proliferation, cytotoxicity and cytokine production. Traditionally, different T cell classes are thought to exhibit mutually exclusive responses, including T(H)1, T(H)2 and T(H)17 programs. However, single-cell RNA sequencing has revealed a continuum of T cell states without clearly distinct subsets, necessitating new analytical frameworks. Here, we introduce T-CellAnnoTator (TCAT), a pipeline that improves T cell characterization by simultaneously quantifying predefined GEPs capturing activation states and cellular subsets. Analyzing 1,700,000 T cells from 700 individuals spanning 38 tissues and five disease contexts, we identify 46 reproducible GEPs reflecting core T cell functions including proliferation, cytotoxicity, exhaustion and effector states. We experimentally demonstrate new activation programs and apply TCAT to characterize activation GEPs that predict immune checkpoint inhibitor response across multiple tumor types. Our software package starCAT generalizes this framework, enabling reproducible annotation in other cell types and tissues.
37620119	2023	Genome research	Fast and accurate out-of-core PCA framework for large scale biobank data.	Principal component analysis (PCA) is widely used in statistics, machine learning, and genomics for dimensionality reduction and uncovering low-dimensional latent structure. To address the challenges posed by ever-growing data size, fast and memory-efficient PCA methods have gained prominence. In this paper, we propose a novel randomized singular value decomposition (RSVD) algorithm implemented in PCAone, featuring a window-based optimization scheme that enables accelerated convergence while improving the accuracy. Additionally, PCAone incorporates out-of-core and multithreaded implementations for the existing Implicitly Restarted Arnoldi Method (IRAM) and RSVD. Through comprehensive evaluations using multiple large-scale real-world data sets in different fields, we show the advantage of PCAone over existing methods. The new algorithm achieves significantly faster computation time while maintaining accuracy comparable to the slower IRAM method. Notably, our analyses of UK Biobank, comprising around 0.5 million individuals and 6.1 million common single nucleotide polymorphisms, show that PCAone accurately computes the top 40 principal components within 9 h. This analysis effectively captures population structure, signals of selection, structural variants, and low recombination regions, utilizing <20 GB of memory and 20 CPU threads. Furthermore, when applied to single-cell RNA sequencing data featuring 1.3 million cells, PCAone, accurately capturing the top 40 principal components in 49 min. This performance represents a 10-fold improvement over state-of-the-art tools.
40794946	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	scDCT: a conditional diffusion-based deep learning model for high-fidelity single-cell cross-modality translation.	Single-cell multi-omics technologies enable comprehensive molecular profiling, offering insights into cellular heterogeneity and biological mechanisms. However, current cross-modality translation methods struggle with high-dimensional, noisy, and sparse single-cell data. We propose single-cell Diffusion models for Cross-modality Translation (scDCT), a probabilistic framework for bidirectional cross-modality translation in single-cell data, including single-cell RNA sequencing, single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing, and protein expression. scDCT integrates modality-specific autoencoders with conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic models to map inputs to latent spaces and perform probabilistic translation across modalities. This design captures cell-type heterogeneity, accounts for data sparsity, and models uncertainty during translation. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that scDCT outperforms state-of-the-art methods across paired, unpaired, cross-type, and cross-tissue settings, offering a robust and interpretable solution for single-cell multi-omics integration.
31566233	2019	Nucleic acids research	Latent cellular analysis robustly reveals subtle diversity in large-scale single-cell RNA-seq data.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool for characterizing the cell-to-cell variation and cellular dynamics in populations which appear homogeneous otherwise in basic and translational biological research. However, significant challenges arise in the analysis of scRNA-seq data, including the low signal-to-noise ratio with high data sparsity, potential batch effects, scalability problems when hundreds of thousands of cells are to be analyzed among others. The inherent complexities of scRNA-seq data and dynamic nature of cellular processes lead to suboptimal performance of many currently available algorithms, even for basic tasks such as identifying biologically meaningful heterogeneous subpopulations. In this study, we developed the Latent Cellular Analysis (LCA), a machine learning-based analytical pipeline that combines cosine-similarity measurement by latent cellular states with a graph-based clustering algorithm. LCA provides heuristic solutions for population number inference, dimension reduction, feature selection, and control of technical variations without explicit gene filtering. We show that LCA is robust, accurate, and powerful by comparison with multiple state-of-the-art computational methods when applied to large-scale real and simulated scRNA-seq data. Importantly, the ability of LCA to learn from representative subsets of the data provides scalability, thereby addressing a significant challenge posed by growing sample sizes in scRNA-seq data analysis.
38565973	2025	Nature biotechnology	The covariance environment defines cellular niches for spatial inference.	A key challenge of analyzing data from high-resolution spatial profiling technologies is to suitably represent the features of cellular neighborhoods or niches. Here we introduce the covariance environment (COVET), a representation that leverages the gene-gene covariate structure across cells in the niche to capture the multivariate nature of cellular interactions within it. We define a principled optimal transport-based distance metric between COVET niches that scales to millions of cells. Using COVET to encode spatial context, we developed environmental variational inference (ENVI), a conditional variational autoencoder that jointly embeds spatial and single-cell RNA sequencing data into a latent space. ENVI includes two decoders: one to impute gene expression across the spatial modality and a second to project spatial information onto single-cell data. ENVI can confer spatial context to genomics data from single dissociated cells and outperforms alternatives for imputing gene expression on diverse spatial datasets.
35137179	2022	Nucleic acids research	Klf4 methylated by Prmt1 restrains the commitment of primitive endoderm.	The second cell fate decision in the early stage of mammalian embryonic development is pivotal; however, the underlying molecular mechanism is largely unexplored. Here, we report that Prmt1 acts as an important regulator in primitive endoderm (PrE) formation. First, Prmt1 depletion promotes PrE gene expression in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Single-cell RNA sequencing and flow cytometry assays demonstrated that Prmt1 depletion in mESCs contributes to an emerging cluster, where PrE genes are upregulated significantly. Furthermore, the efficiency of extraembryonic endoderm stem cell induction increased in Prmt1-depleted ESCs. Second, the pluripotency factor Klf4 methylated at Arg396 by Prmt1 is required for recruitment of the repressive mSin3a/HDAC complex to silence PrE genes. Most importantly, an embryonic chimeric assay showed that Prmt1 inhibition and mutated Klf4 at Arg 396 induce the integration of mouse ESCs into the PrE lineage. Therefore, we reveal a regulatory mechanism for cell fate decisions centered on Prmt1-mediated Klf4 methylation.
34986249	2022	Nucleic acids research	scMAGIC: accurately annotating single cells using two rounds of reference-based classification.	Here, we introduce scMAGIC (Single Cell annotation using MArker Genes Identification and two rounds of reference-based Classification [RBC]), a novel method that uses well-annotated single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data as the reference to assist in the classification of query scRNA-seq data. A key innovation in scMAGIC is the introduction of a second-round RBC in which those query cells whose cell identities are confidently validated in the first round are used as a new reference to again classify query cells, therefore eliminating the batch effects between the reference and the query data. scMAGIC significantly outperforms 13 competing RBC methods with their optimal parameter settings across 86 benchmark tests, especially when the cell types in the query dataset are not completely covered by the reference dataset and when there exist significant batch effects between the reference and the query datasets. Moreover, when no reference dataset is available, scMAGIC can annotate query cells with reasonably high accuracy by using an atlas dataset as the reference.
32430339	2020	Genome research	Exploring dimension-reduced embeddings with Sleepwalk.	Dimension-reduction methods, such as t-SNE or UMAP, are widely used when exploring high-dimensional data describing many entities, for example, RNA-seq data for many single cells. However, dimension reduction is commonly prone to introducing artifacts, and we hence need means to see where a dimension-reduced embedding is a faithful representation of the local neighborhood and where it is not. We present Sleepwalk, a simple but powerful tool that allows the user to interactively explore an embedding, using color to depict original or any other distances from all points to the cell under the mouse cursor. We show how this approach not only highlights distortions but also reveals otherwise hidden characteristics of the data, and how Sleepwalk's comparative modes help integrate multisample data and understand differences between embedding and preprocessing methods. Sleepwalk is a versatile and intuitive tool that unlocks the full power of dimension reduction and will be of value not only in single-cell RNA-seq but also in any other area with matrix-shaped big data.
38061196	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	CellTICS: an explainable neural network for cell-type identification and interpretation based on single-cell RNA-seq data.	"Identifying cell types is crucial for understanding the functional units of an organism. Machine learning has shown promising performance in identifying cell types, but many existing methods lack biological significance due to poor interpretability. However, it is of the utmost importance to understand what makes cells share the same function and form a specific cell type, motivating us to propose a biologically interpretable method. CellTICS prioritizes marker genes with cell-type-specific expression, using a hierarchy of biological pathways for neural network construction, and applying a multi-predictive-layer strategy to predict cell and sub-cell types. CellTICS usually outperforms existing methods in prediction accuracy. Moreover, CellTICS can reveal pathways that define a cell type or a cell type under specific physiological conditions, such as disease or aging. The nonlinear nature of neural networks enables us to identify many novel pathways. Interestingly, some of the pathways identified by CellTICS exhibit differential expression ""variability"" rather than differential expression across cell types, indicating that expression stochasticity within a pathway could be an important feature characteristic of a cell type. Overall, CellTICS provides a biologically interpretable method for identifying and characterizing cell types, shedding light on the underlying pathways that define cellular heterogeneity and its role in organismal function. CellTICS is available at https://github.com/qyyin0516/CellTICS."
31948481	2020	Genome biology	A benchmark of batch-effect correction methods for single-cell RNA sequencing data.	BACKGROUND: Large-scale single-cell transcriptomic datasets generated using different technologies contain batch-specific systematic variations that present a challenge to batch-effect removal and data integration. With continued growth expected in scRNA-seq data, achieving effective batch integration with available computational resources is crucial. Here, we perform an in-depth benchmark study on available batch correction methods to determine the most suitable method for batch-effect removal. RESULTS: We compare 14 methods in terms of computational runtime, the ability to handle large datasets, and batch-effect correction efficacy while preserving cell type purity. Five scenarios are designed for the study: identical cell types with different technologies, non-identical cell types, multiple batches, big data, and simulated data. Performance is evaluated using four benchmarking metrics including kBET, LISI, ASW, and ARI. We also investigate the use of batch-corrected data to study differential gene expression. CONCLUSION: Based on our results, Harmony, LIGER, and Seurat 3 are the recommended methods for batch integration. Due to its significantly shorter runtime, Harmony is recommended as the first method to try, with the other methods as viable alternatives.
36864196	2023	Nature methods	Single-cell proteomics enabled by next-generation sequencing or mass spectrometry.	In the last decade, single-cell RNA sequencing routinely performed on large numbers of single cells has greatly advanced our understanding of the underlying heterogeneity of complex biological systems. Technological advances have also enabled protein measurements, further contributing to the elucidation of cell types and states present in complex tissues. Recently, there have been independent advances in mass spectrometric techniques bringing us one step closer to characterizing single-cell proteomes. Here we discuss the challenges of detecting proteins in single cells by both mass spectrometry and sequencing-based methods. We review the state of the art for these techniques and propose that there is a space for technological advancements and complementary approaches that maximize the advantages of both classes of technologies.
41171146	2025	Nucleic acids research	connectomeDB2025: a rigorously curated, multi-species resource of experimentally supported ligand-receptor interactions.	"Inferring cell-cell communication networks is now a cornerstone of single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data analysis, relying critically on reference catalogues of experimentally supported ligand-receptor interactions. Here, we present the updated, rigorously curated connectomeDB, an open-access database of peptide-based ligand-receptor pairs comprising 3579 vertebrate interactions supported by primary experimental evidence from 2803 research articles. By critically reviewing all putative ligand-receptor pairs from connectomeDB2020, CellChatDB v2, CellPhoneDB v5, CellTalkDB, ICELLNET v2, and LIANA+, we first removed over 2900 misclassified or unsupported interactions lacking primary-literature evidence. We then expanded the resulting verified dataset through AI-assisted literature mining and manual curation, adding 827 pairs and 718 supporting articles absent from other databases, including 264 pairs first described since 2020. connectomeDB2025 contains 5429 evidence links (""triplets""), each connecting a ligand-receptor pair to a specific publication, collectively providing at least one source of primary experimental evidence for each interaction. Notably, 2359 of these triplets are exclusive to connectomeDB2025, making it the most robustly supported ligand-receptor database with primary experimental evidence. The online resource (https://connectomedb.org) provides searchable, downloadable ligand-receptor lists and detailed pair summaries, enabling accurate cell-cell communication analysis across human, mouse, and 12 other vertebrate species."
40750330	2025	Genome research	Epigenetic drift score captures directional methylation variability and links aging to transcriptional, metabolic, and genetic alterations.	Epigenetic drift refers to the gradual and stochastic accumulation of epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation variability, with advancing age. Although increasingly recognized for its potential role in aging biology, its extent, biological significance, and population specificity remain insufficiently characterized. Here, we present the first comprehensive epigenome-wide drift study (EWDS) in a large Chinese cohort (n = 3538), with replication in two independent Chinese (total n = 1467) and two European cohorts (total n = 956), to investigate the scale and relevance of epigenetic drift across populations. Through simulation, we identify White's test as the most powerful method among four alternatives for detecting age-associated methylation variability. Our EWDS reveals that 10.8% (50,385 CpGs) of sites on the 850 K EPIC array exhibit epigenome-wide significant drift, with 99% showing increased interindividual variability (positive drift) and 1% showing decreased variability (negative drift). Integration with single-cell RNA-seq data demonstrates that positive drift-CpGs are associated with increased transcriptional variability and upregulation in specific cell types, whereas negative drift-CpGs exhibit the opposite effect. We develop epigenetic drift scores (EDSs) to quantify individual drift burden; these scores are strongly age-associated and correlate with lipidomic profiles and clinical aging indicators. Longitudinal data confirm within-individual accumulation of drift over time. Finally, a GWAS of EDS identifies genetic determinants of drift magnitude, including heritable loci (e.g., ASTN2, SOCS5). Collectively, these findings establish epigenetic drift as a pervasive, directional, and biologically meaningful feature of human aging.
33170214	2021	Nucleic acids research	TENET: gene network reconstruction using transfer entropy reveals key regulatory factors from single cell transcriptomic data.	Accurate prediction of gene regulatory rules is important towards understanding of cellular processes. Existing computational algorithms devised for bulk transcriptomics typically require a large number of time points to infer gene regulatory networks (GRNs), are applicable for a small number of genes and fail to detect potential causal relationships effectively. Here, we propose a novel approach 'TENET' to reconstruct GRNs from single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) datasets. Employing transfer entropy (TE) to measure the amount of causal relationships between genes, TENET predicts large-scale gene regulatory cascades/relationships from scRNAseq data. TENET showed better performance than other GRN reconstructors, in identifying key regulators from public datasets. Specifically from scRNAseq, TENET identified key transcriptional factors in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and during direct cardiomyocytes reprogramming, where other predictors failed. We further demonstrate that known target genes have significantly higher TE values, and TENET predicted higher TE genes were more influenced by the perturbation of their regulator. Using TENET, we identified and validated that Nme2 is a culture condition specific stem cell factor. These results indicate that TENET is uniquely capable of identifying key regulators from scRNAseq data.
40889155	2025	Nucleic acids research	An interpretable and adaptive autoencoder for efficient tissue deconvolution.	Deconvolution models are a powerful tool for extracting cell-type-specific information from bulk gene expression profiles. Current methods leverage advanced machine learning models and high-resolution sequencing, like single-cell RNA-sequencing, showing promising results across diverse tissues and conditions. However, they still present important limitations: First, many depend on selecting a robust reference, which can strongly affect the deconvolution. Second, pseudobulk data used for training and real bulk RNA-seq samples often exhibit strong distribution shifts, which are currently unaccounted for. Finally, most deconvolution approaches behave as black boxes, which can compromise the reliability of the results. Here, we present Sweetwater, an adaptive and interpretable autoencoder that efficiently deconvolves bulk samples leveraging multiple classes of reference data. Moreover, we propose an improved way of generating training data from a mixture of FACS-sorted FASTQ files, reducing platform-specific biases and outperforming current single-cell-based references. Furthermore, we introduce a gold standard dataset to facilitate fair and accurate evaluation of deconvolution approaches. Finally, we demonstrate that Sweetwater adapts effectively to deconvolved samples during training, uncovering biologically meaningful patterns and enhancing result's reliability. Sweetwater is available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.29609180, and we anticipate it will expedite the accurate examination of high-throughput clinical data across diverse applications.
37243667	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	IndepthPathway: an integrated tool for in-depth pathway enrichment analysis based on single-cell sequencing data.	"MOTIVATION: Single-cell sequencing enables exploring the pathways and processes of cells, and cell populations. However, there is a paucity of pathway enrichment methods designed to tolerate the high noise and low gene coverage of this technology. When gene expression data are noisy and signals are sparse, testing pathway enrichment based on the genes expression may not yield statistically significant results, which is particularly problematic when detecting the pathways enriched in less abundant cells that are vulnerable to disturbances. RESULTS: In this project, we developed a Weighted Concept Signature Enrichment Analysis specialized for pathway enrichment analysis from single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq). Weighted Concept Signature Enrichment Analysis took a broader approach for assessing the functional relations of pathway gene sets to differentially expressed genes, and leverage the cumulative signature of molecular concepts characteristic of the highly differentially expressed genes, which we termed as the universal concept signature, to tolerate the high noise and low coverage of this technology. We then incorporated Weighted Concept Signature Enrichment Analysis into an R package called ""IndepthPathway"" for biologists to broadly leverage this method for pathway analysis based on bulk and single-cell sequencing data. Through simulating technical variability and dropouts in gene expression characteristic of scRNA-seq as well as benchmarking on a real dataset of matched single-cell and bulk RNAseq data, we demonstrate that IndepthPathway presents outstanding stability and depth in pathway enrichment results under stochasticity of the data, thus will substantially improve the scientific rigor of the pathway analysis for single-cell sequencing data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The IndepthPathway R package is available through: https://github.com/wangxlab/IndepthPathway."

39404795	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scDRMAE: integrating masked autoencoder with residual attention networks to leverage omics feature dependencies for accurate cell clustering.	MOTIVATION: Cell clustering is foundational for analyzing the heterogeneity of biological tissues using single-cell sequencing data. With the maturation of single-cell multi-omics sequencing technologies, we can integrate multiple omics data to perform cell clustering, thereby overcoming the limitations of insufficient information from single omics data. Existing methods for cell clustering often only consider the differences in data patterns during the analysis of multi-omics data, but the dependencies between omics features of different cell types also significantly influence cell clustering. Moreover, the high dropout rates in scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data can impact the performance of cell clustering. RESULTS: We propose a cell clustering model based on a masked autoencoder, scDRMAE. Utilizing a masking mechanism, scDRMAE effectively learns the relationships between different features and imputes false zeros caused by dropout events. To differentiate the importance of various omics data in cell clustering, we dynamically adjust the weights of different omics data through an attention mechanism. Finally, we use the K-means algorithm for cluster analysis of the fused multi-omics data. On commonly used sets of 15 multi-omics datasets, our method demonstrates superior cell clustering performance on multiple metrics compared to other computational methods. In addition, when datasets exhibit varying degrees of dropout noise, our method shows better performance and stronger stability on multiple metrics compared to other methods. Moreover, by analyzing the cell clusters classified by scDRMAE, we identified several biologically significant biomarkers that have been validated, further confirming the effectiveness of scDRMAE in cell clustering from a biological perspective.
39878904	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scHNTL: single-cell RNA-seq data clustering augmented by high-order neighbors and triplet loss.	MOTIVATION: The rapid development of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has significantly advanced biomedical research. Clustering analysis, crucial for scRNA-seq data, faces challenges including data sparsity, high dimensionality, and variable gene expressions. Better low-dimensional embeddings for these complex data should maintain intrinsic information while making similar data close and dissimilar data distant. However, existing methods utilizing neural networks typically focus on minimizing reconstruction loss and maintaining similarity in embeddings of directly related cells, but fail to consider dissimilarity, thus lacking separability and limiting the performance of clustering. RESULTS: We propose a novel clustering algorithm, called scHNTL (scRNA-seq data clustering augmented by high-order neighbors and triplet loss). It first constructs an auxiliary similarity graph and uses a Graph Attentional Autoencoder to learn initial embeddings of cells. Then it identifies similar and dissimilar cells by exploring high-order structures of the similarity graph and exploits a triplet loss of contrastive learning, to improve the embeddings in preserving structural information by separating dissimilar pairs. Finally, this improvement for embedding and the target of clustering are fused in a self-optimizing clustering framework to obtain the clusters. Experimental evaluations on 16 real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of scHNTL in clustering over the state-of-the-arts single-cell clustering algorithms. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Python implementation of scHNTL is available at Figshare (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.27001090) and Github (https://github.com/SWJTU-ML/scHNTL-code).
34428202	2021	PLoS computational biology	miQC: An adaptive probabilistic framework for quality control of single-cell RNA-sequencing data.	Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has made it possible to profile gene expression in tissues at high resolution. An important preprocessing step prior to performing downstream analyses is to identify and remove cells with poor or degraded sample quality using quality control (QC) metrics. Two widely used QC metrics to identify a 'low-quality' cell are (i) if the cell includes a high proportion of reads that map to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encoded genes and (ii) if a small number of genes are detected. Current best practices use these QC metrics independently with either arbitrary, uniform thresholds (e.g. 5%) or biological context-dependent (e.g. species) thresholds, and fail to jointly model these metrics in a data-driven manner. Current practices are often overly stringent and especially untenable on certain types of tissues, such as archived tumor tissues, or tissues associated with mitochondrial function, such as kidney tissue [1]. We propose a data-driven QC metric (miQC) that jointly models both the proportion of reads mapping to mtDNA genes and the number of detected genes with mixture models in a probabilistic framework to predict the low-quality cells in a given dataset. We demonstrate how our QC metric easily adapts to different types of single-cell datasets to remove low-quality cells while preserving high-quality cells that can be used for downstream analyses. Our software package is available at https://bioconductor.org/packages/miQC.
38915088	2024	Genome biology	scHolography: a computational method for single-cell spatial neighborhood reconstruction and analysis.	Spatial transcriptomics has transformed our ability to study tissue complexity. However, it remains challenging to accurately dissect tissue organization at single-cell resolution. Here we introduce scHolography, a machine learning-based method designed to reconstruct single-cell spatial neighborhoods and facilitate 3D tissue visualization using spatial and single-cell RNA sequencing data. scHolography employs a high-dimensional transcriptome-to-space projection that infers spatial relationships among cells, defining spatial neighborhoods and enhancing analyses of cell-cell communication. When applied to both human and mouse datasets, scHolography enables quantitative assessments of spatial cell neighborhoods, cell-cell interactions, and tumor-immune microenvironment. Together, scHolography offers a robust computational framework for elucidating 3D tissue organization and analyzing spatial dynamics at the cellular level.
34020546	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	A comprehensive survey of regulatory network inference methods using single cell RNA sequencing data.	Gene regulatory network is a complicated set of interactions between genetic materials, which dictates how cells develop in living organisms and react to their surrounding environment. Robust comprehension of these interactions would help explain how cells function as well as predict their reactions to external factors. This knowledge can benefit both developmental biology and clinical research such as drug development or epidemiology research. Recently, the rapid advance of single-cell sequencing technologies, which pushed the limit of transcriptomic profiling to the individual cell level, opens up an entirely new area for regulatory network research. To exploit this new abundant source of data and take advantage of data in single-cell resolution, a number of computational methods have been proposed to uncover the interactions hidden by the averaging process in standard bulk sequencing. In this article, we review 15 such network inference methods developed for single-cell data. We discuss their underlying assumptions, inference techniques, usability, and pros and cons. In an extensive analysis using simulation, we also assess the methods' performance, sensitivity to dropout and time complexity. The main objective of this survey is to assist not only life scientists in selecting suitable methods for their data and analysis purposes but also computational scientists in developing new methods by highlighting outstanding challenges in the field that remain to be addressed in the future development.
35761403	2022	Genome biology	scDART: integrating unmatched scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data and learning cross-modality relationship simultaneously.	It is a challenging task to integrate scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data obtained from different batches. Existing methods tend to use a pre-defined gene activity matrix to convert the scATAC-seq data into scRNA-seq data. The pre-defined gene activity matrix is often of low quality and does not reflect the dataset-specific relationship between the two data modalities. We propose scDART, a deep learning framework that integrates scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data and learns cross-modalities relationships simultaneously. Specifically, the design of scDART allows it to preserve cell trajectories in continuous cell populations and can be applied to trajectory inference on integrated data.
33003202	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	A review of computational strategies for denoising and imputation of single-cell transcriptomic data.	MOTIVATION: The advancements of single-cell sequencing methods have paved the way for the characterization of cellular states at unprecedented resolution, revolutionizing the investigation on complex biological systems. Yet, single-cell sequencing experiments are hindered by several technical issues, which cause output data to be noisy, impacting the reliability of downstream analyses. Therefore, a growing number of data science methods has been proposed to recover lost or corrupted information from single-cell sequencing data. To date, however, no quantitative benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate such methods. RESULTS: We present a comprehensive analysis of the state-of-the-art computational approaches for denoising and imputation of single-cell transcriptomic data, comparing their performance in different experimental scenarios. In detail, we compared 19 denoising and imputation methods, on both simulated and real-world datasets, with respect to several performance metrics related to imputation of dropout events, recovery of true expression profiles, characterization of cell similarity, identification of differentially expressed genes and computation time. The effectiveness and scalability of all methods were assessed with regard to distinct sequencing protocols, sample size and different levels of biological variability and technical noise. As a result, we identify a subset of versatile approaches exhibiting solid performances on most tests and show that certain algorithmic families prove effective on specific tasks but inefficient on others. Finally, most methods appear to benefit from the introduction of appropriate assumptions on noise distribution of biological processes.
35697807	2022	Nature biotechnology	Estimation of tumor cell total mRNA expression in 15 cancer types predicts disease progression.	Single-cell RNA sequencing studies have suggested that total mRNA content correlates with tumor phenotypes. Technical and analytical challenges, however, have so far impeded at-scale pan-cancer examination of total mRNA content. Here we present a method to quantify tumor-specific total mRNA expression (TmS) from bulk sequencing data, taking into account tumor transcript proportion, purity and ploidy, which are estimated through transcriptomic/genomic deconvolution. We estimate and validate TmS in 6,590 patient tumors across 15 cancer types, identifying significant inter-tumor variability. Across cancers, high TmS is associated with increased risk of disease progression and death. TmS is influenced by cancer-specific patterns of gene alteration and intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity as well as by pan-cancer trends in metabolic dysregulation. Taken together, our results indicate that measuring cell-type-specific total mRNA expression in tumor cells predicts tumor phenotypes and clinical outcomes.
40188497	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	scMUG: deep clustering analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data on multiple gene functional modules.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity by providing gene expression data at the single-cell level. Unlike bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq allows identification of different cell types within a given tissue, leading to a more nuanced comprehension of cell functions. However, the analysis of scRNA-seq data presents challenges due to its sparsity and high dimensionality. Since bioinformatics plays an important role in the analysis of big data and its utility for the welfare of living beings, it has been widely applied in analyzing scRNA-seq data. To address these challenges, we introduce the scMUG computational pipeline, which incorporates gene functional module information to enhance scRNA-seq clustering analysis. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, cell representation generation, cell-cell similarity matrix construction, and clustering analysis. The scMUG pipeline also introduces a novel similarity measure that combines local density and global distribution in the latent cell representation space. As far as we can tell, this is the first attempt to integrate gene functional associations into scRNA-seq clustering analysis. We curated nine human scRNA-seq datasets to evaluate our scMUG pipeline. With the help of gene functional information and the novel similarity measure, the clustering results from scMUG pipeline present deep insights into functional relationships between gene expression patterns and cellular heterogeneity. In addition, our scMUG pipeline also presents comparable or better clustering performances than other state-of-the-art methods. All source codes of scMUG have been deposited in a GitHub repository with instructions for reproducing all results (https://github.com/degiminnal/scMUG).
40366859	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Decoupled GNNs based on multi-view contrastive learning for scRNA-seq data clustering.	Clustering is pivotal in deciphering cellular heterogeneity in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. However, it suffers from several challenges in handling the high dimensionality and complexity of scRNA-seq data. Especially when employing graph neural networks (GNNs) for cell clustering, the dependencies between cells expand exponentially with the number of layers. This results in high computational complexity, negatively impacting the model's training efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach, called decoupled GNNs, based on multi-view contrastive learning (scDeGNN), for scRNA-seq data clustering. Firstly, this method constructs two adjacency matrices to generate distinct views, and trains them using decoupled GNNs to derive the initial cell feature representations. These representations are then refined through a multilayer perceptron and a contrastive learning layer, ensuring the consistency and discriminability of the learned features. Finally, the learned representations are fused and applied to the cell clustering task. Extensive experimental results on nine real scRNA-seq datasets from various organisms and tissues show that the proposed scDeGNN method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art scRNA-seq data clustering algorithms across multiple evaluation metrics.

Analysis of the composition of heterogeneous tissue has been greatly enabled by recent developments in single-cell transcriptomics.

SCell is open source, and implemented with an intuitive graphical interface. Scripts and protocols for the high-throughput pre-processing of large ensembles of single-cell, RNA-seq datasets are provided as an additional resource.

30137247	2019	Briefings in bioinformatics	Impact of similarity metrics on single-cell RNA-seq data clustering.	Advances in high-throughput sequencing on single-cell gene expressions [single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)] have enabled transcriptome profiling on individual cells from complex samples. A common goal in scRNA-seq data analysis is to discover and characterise cell types, typically through clustering methods. The quality of the clustering therefore plays a critical role in biological discovery. While numerous clustering algorithms have been proposed for scRNA-seq data, fundamentally they all rely on a similarity metric for categorising individual cells. Although several studies have compared the performance of various clustering algorithms for scRNA-seq data, currently there is no benchmark of different similarity metrics and their influence on scRNA-seq data clustering. Here, we compared a panel of similarity metrics on clustering a collection of annotated scRNA-seq datasets. Within each dataset, a stratified subsampling procedure was applied and an array of evaluation measures was employed to assess the similarity metrics. This produced a highly reliable and reproducible consensus on their performance assessment. Overall, we found that correlation-based metrics (e.g. Pearson's correlation) outperformed distance-based metrics (e.g. Euclidean distance). To test if the use of correlation-based metrics can benefit the recently published clustering techniques for scRNA-seq data, we modified a state-of-the-art kernel-based clustering algorithm (SIMLR) using Pearson's correlation as a similarity measure and found significant performance improvement over Euclidean distance on scRNA-seq data clustering. These findings demonstrate the importance of similarity metrics in clustering scRNA-seq data and highlight Pearson's correlation as a favourable choice. Further comparison on different scRNA-seq library preparation protocols suggests that they may also affect clustering performance. Finally, the benchmarking framework is available at http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/SMS/bioinformatics/software.html.
40097811	2025	Nature methods	scNET: learning context-specific gene and cell embeddings by integrating single-cell gene expression data with protein-protein interactions.	Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) techniques have provided unprecedented insights into the heterogeneity of various tissues. However, gene expression data alone often fails to capture and identify changes in cellular pathways and complexes, as they are more discernible at the protein level. Moreover, analyzing scRNA-seq data presents further challenges due to inherent characteristics such as high noise levels and zero inflation. In this study, we propose an approach to address these limitations by integrating scRNA-seq datasets with a protein-protein interaction network. Our method utilizes a unique dual-view architecture based on graph neural networks, enabling joint representation of gene expression and protein-protein interaction network data. This approach models gene-to-gene relationships under specific biological contexts and refines cell-cell relations using an attention mechanism. Next, through comprehensive evaluations, we demonstrate that scNET better captures gene annotation, pathway characterization and gene-gene relationship identification, while improving cell clustering and pathway analysis across diverse cell types and biological conditions.
29529018	2018	Nature methods	Alignment of single-cell trajectories to compare cellular expression dynamics.	Single-cell RNA sequencing and high-dimensional cytometry can be used to generate detailed trajectories of dynamic biological processes such as differentiation or development. Here we present cellAlign, a quantitative framework for comparing expression dynamics within and between single-cell trajectories. By applying cellAlign to mouse and human embryonic developmental trajectories, we systematically delineate differences in the temporal regulation of gene expression programs that would otherwise be masked.
30936567	2019	Nature biotechnology	Inferring population dynamics from single-cell RNA-sequencing time series data.	Recent single-cell RNA-sequencing studies have suggested that cells follow continuous transcriptomic trajectories in an asynchronous fashion during development. However, observations of cell flux along trajectories are confounded with population size effects in snapshot experiments and are therefore hard to interpret. In particular, changes in proliferation and death rates can be mistaken for cell flux. Here we present pseudodynamics, a mathematical framework that reconciles population dynamics with the concepts underlying developmental trajectories inferred from time-series single-cell data. Pseudodynamics models population distribution shifts across trajectories to quantify selection pressure, population expansion, and developmental potentials. Applying this model to time-resolved single-cell RNA-sequencing of T-cell and pancreatic beta cell maturation, we characterize proliferation and apoptosis rates and identify key developmental checkpoints, data inaccessible to existing approaches.
30061114	2018	Genome research	Single-cell RNA-seq analysis identifies markers of resistance to targeted BRAF inhibitors in melanoma cell populations.	Single-cell RNA-seq's (scRNA-seq) unprecedented cellular resolution at a genome-wide scale enables us to address questions about cellular heterogeneity that are inaccessible using methods that average over bulk tissue extracts. However, scRNA-seq data sets also present additional challenges such as high transcript dropout rates, stochastic transcription events, and complex population substructures. Here, we present a single-cell RNA-seq analysis and klustering evaluation (SAKE), a robust method for scRNA-seq analysis that provides quantitative statistical metrics at each step of the analysis pipeline. Comparing SAKE to multiple single-cell analysis methods shows that most methods perform similarly across a wide range of cellular contexts, with SAKE outperforming these methods in the case of large complex populations. We next applied the SAKE algorithms to identify drug-resistant cellular populations as human melanoma cells respond to targeted BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi). Single-cell RNA-seq data from both the Fluidigm C1 and 10x Genomics platforms were analyzed with SAKE to dissect this problem at multiple scales. Data from both platforms indicate that BRAF inhibitor-resistant cells can emerge from rare populations already present before drug application, with SAKE identifying both novel and known markers of resistance. These experimentally validated markers of BRAFi resistance share overlap with previous analyses in different melanoma cell lines, demonstrating the generality of these findings and highlighting the utility of single-cell analysis to elucidate mechanisms of BRAFi resistance.
33341869	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	Inferring microenvironmental regulation of gene expression from single-cell RNA sequencing data using scMLnet with an application to COVID-19.	Inferring how gene expression in a cell is influenced by cellular microenvironment is of great importance yet challenging. In this study, we present a single-cell RNA-sequencing data based multilayer network method (scMLnet) that models not only functional intercellular communications but also intracellular gene regulatory networks (https://github.com/SunXQlab/scMLnet). scMLnet was applied to a scRNA-seq dataset of COVID-19 patients to decipher the microenvironmental regulation of expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 that has been reported to be correlated with inflammatory cytokines and COVID-19 severity. The predicted elevation of ACE2 by extracellular cytokines EGF, IFN-gamma or TNF-alpha were experimentally validated in human lung cells and the related signaling pathway were verified to be significantly activated during SARS-COV-2 infection. Our study provided a new approach to uncover inter-/intra-cellular signaling mechanisms of gene expression and revealed microenvironmental regulators of ACE2 expression, which may facilitate designing anti-cytokine therapies or targeted therapies for controlling COVID-19 infection. In addition, we summarized and compared different methods of scRNA-seq based inter-/intra-cellular signaling network inference for facilitating new methodology development and applications.
35870203	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	CBLRR: a cauchy-based bounded constraint low-rank representation method to cluster single-cell RNA-seq data.	The rapid development of single-cel+l RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology provides unprecedented opportunities for exploring biological phenomena at the single-cell level. The discovery of cell types is one of the major applications for researchers to explore the heterogeneity of cells. Some computational methods have been proposed to solve the problem of scRNA-seq data clustering. However, the unavoidable technical noise and notorious dropouts also reduce the accuracy of clustering methods. Here, we propose the cauchy-based bounded constraint low-rank representation (CBLRR), which is a low-rank representation-based method by introducing cauchy loss function (CLF) and bounded nuclear norm regulation, aiming to alleviate the above issue. Specifically, as an effective loss function, the CLF is proven to enhance the robustness of the identification of cell types. Then, we adopt the bounded constraint to ensure the entry values of single-cell data within the restricted interval. Finally, the performance of CBLRR is evaluated on 15 scRNA-seq datasets, and compared with other state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate that CBLRR performs accurately and robustly on clustering scRNA-seq data. Furthermore, CBLRR is an effective tool to cluster cells, and provides great potential for downstream analysis of single-cell data. The source code of CBLRR is available online at https://github.com/Ginnay/CBLRR.
37596691	2023	Genome biology	GTM-decon: guided-topic modeling of single-cell transcriptomes enables sub-cell-type and disease-subtype deconvolution of bulk transcriptomes.	Cell-type composition is an important indicator of health. We present Guided Topic Model for deconvolution (GTM-decon) to automatically infer cell-type-specific gene topic distributions from single-cell RNA-seq data for deconvolving bulk transcriptomes. GTM-decon performs competitively on deconvolving simulated and real bulk data compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, as demonstrated in deconvolving disease transcriptomes, GTM-decon can infer multiple cell-type-specific gene topic distributions per cell type, which captures sub-cell-type variations. GTM-decon can also use phenotype labels from single-cell or bulk data to infer phenotype-specific gene distributions. In a nested-guided design, GTM-decon identified cell-type-specific differentially expressed genes from bulk breast cancer transcriptomes.
32580738	2020	Genome biology	Single-cell transcriptome and antigen-immunoglobin analysis reveals the diversity of B cells in non-small cell lung cancer.	BACKGROUND: Malignant transformation and progression of cancer are driven by the co-evolution of cancer cells and their dysregulated tumor microenvironment (TME). Recent studies on immunotherapy demonstrate the efficacy in reverting the anti-tumoral function of T cells, highlighting the therapeutic potential in targeting certain cell types in TME. However, the functions of other immune cell types remain largely unexplored. RESULTS: We conduct a single-cell RNA-seq analysis of cells isolated from tumor tissue samples of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, and identify subtypes of tumor-infiltrated B cells and their diverse functions in the progression of NSCLC. Flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry experiments on two independent cohorts confirm the co-existence of the two major subtypes of B cells, namely the naive-like and plasma-like B cells. The naive-like B cells are decreased in advanced NSCLC, and their lower level is associated with poor prognosis. Co-culture of isolated naive-like B cells from NSCLC patients with two lung cancer cell lines demonstrate that the naive-like B cells suppress the growth of lung cancer cells by secreting four factors negatively regulating the cell growth. We also demonstrate that the plasma-like B cells inhibit cancer cell growth in the early stage of NSCLC, but promote cell growth in the advanced stage of NSCLC. The roles of the plasma-like B cell produced immunoglobulins, and their interacting proteins in the progression of NSCLC are further validated by proteomics data. CONCLUSION: Our analysis reveals versatile functions of tumor-infiltrating B cells and their potential clinical implications in NSCLC.
36448703	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	SCExecute: custom cell barcode-stratified analyses of scRNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: In single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, stratification of sequencing reads by cellular barcode is necessary to study cell-specific features. However, apart from gene expression, the analyses of cell-specific features are not sufficiently supported by available tools designed for high-throughput sequencing data. RESULTS: We introduce SCExecute, which executes a user-provided command on barcode-stratified, extracted on-the-fly, single-cell binary alignment map (scBAM) files. SCExecute extracts the alignments with each cell barcode from aligned, pooled single-cell sequencing data. Simple commands, monolithic programs, multi-command shell scripts or complex shell-based pipelines are then executed on each scBAM file. scBAM files can be restricted to specific barcodes and/or genomic regions of interest. We demonstrate SCExecute with two popular variant callers-GATK and Strelka2-executed in shell-scripts together with commands for BAM file manipulation and variant filtering, to detect single-cell-specific expressed single nucleotide variants from droplet scRNA-seq data (10X Genomics Chromium System).In conclusion, SCExecute facilitates custom cell-level analyses on barcoded scRNA-seq data using currently available tools and provides an effective solution for studying low (cellular) frequency transcriptome features. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: SCExecute is implemented in Python3 using the Pysam package and distributed for Linux, MacOS and Python environments from https://horvathlab.github.io/NGS/SCExecute.

33986545	2021	Nature methods	TRUST4: immune repertoire reconstruction from bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data.	We introduce the TRUST4 open-source algorithm for reconstruction of immune receptor repertoires in alphabeta/gammadelta T cells and B cells from RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data. Compared with competing methods, TRUST4 supports both FASTQ and BAM format and is faster and more sensitive in assembling longer-even full-length-receptor repertoires. TRUST4 can also call repertoire sequences from single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data without V(D)J enrichment, and is compatible with both SMART-seq and 5' 10x Genomics platforms.
40179341	2025	PLoS computational biology	Predicting and comparing transcription start sites in single cell populations.	The advent of 5' single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies offers unique opportunities to identify and analyze transcription start sites (TSSs) at a single-cell resolution. These technologies have the potential to uncover the complexities of transcription initiation and alternative TSS usage across different cell types and conditions. Despite the emergence of computational methods designed to analyze 5' RNA sequencing data, current methods often lack comparative evaluations in single-cell contexts and are predominantly tailored for paired-end data, neglecting the potential of single-end data. This study introduces scTSS, a computational pipeline developed to bridge this gap by accommodating both paired-end and single-end 5' scRNA-seq data. scTSS enables joint analysis of multiple single-cell samples, starting with TSS cluster prediction and quantification, followed by differential TSS usage analysis. It employs a Binomial generalized linear mixed model to accurately and efficiently detect differential TSS usage. We demonstrate the utility of scTSS through its application in analyzing transcriptional initiation from single-cell data of two distinct diseases. The results illustrate scTSS's ability to discern alternative TSS usage between different cell types or biological conditions and to identify cell subpopulations characterized by unique TSS-level expression profiles.
32312741	2020	Genome research	Characterizing and inferring quantitative cell cycle phase in single-cell RNA-seq data analysis.	Cellular heterogeneity in gene expression is driven by cellular processes, such as cell cycle and cell-type identity, and cellular environment such as spatial location. The cell cycle, in particular, is thought to be a key driver of cell-to-cell heterogeneity in gene expression, even in otherwise homogeneous cell populations. Recent advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) facilitate detailed characterization of gene expression heterogeneity and can thus shed new light on the processes driving heterogeneity. Here, we combined fluorescence imaging with scRNA-seq to measure cell cycle phase and gene expression levels in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). By using these data, we developed a novel approach to characterize cell cycle progression. Although standard methods assign cells to discrete cell cycle stages, our method goes beyond this and quantifies cell cycle progression on a continuum. We found that, on average, scRNA-seq data from only five genes predicted a cell's position on the cell cycle continuum to within 14% of the entire cycle and that using more genes did not improve this accuracy. Our data and predictor of cell cycle phase can directly help future studies to account for cell cycle-related heterogeneity in iPSCs. Our results and methods also provide a foundation for future work to characterize the effects of the cell cycle on expression heterogeneity in other cell types.
33151294	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	ILoReg: a tool for high-resolution cell population identification from single-cell RNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA-seq allows researchers to identify cell populations based on unsupervised clustering of the transcriptome. However, subpopulations can have only subtle transcriptomic differences and the high dimensionality of the data makes their identification challenging. RESULTS: We introduce ILoReg, an R package implementing a new cell population identification method that improves identification of cell populations with subtle differences through a probabilistic feature extraction step that is applied before clustering and visualization. The feature extraction is performed using a novel machine learning algorithm, called iterative clustering projection (ICP), that uses logistic regression and clustering similarity comparison to iteratively cluster data. Remarkably, ICP also manages to integrate feature selection with the clustering through L1-regularization, enabling the identification of genes that are differentially expressed between cell populations. By combining solutions of multiple ICP runs into a single consensus solution, ILoReg creates a representation that enables investigating cell populations with a high resolution. In particular, we show that the visualization of ILoReg allows segregation of immune and pancreatic cell populations in a more pronounced manner compared with current state-of-the-art methods. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: ILoReg is available as an R package at https://bioconductor.org/packages/ILoReg. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
23594475	2013	Genome biology	Quartz-Seq: a highly reproducible and sensitive single-cell RNA sequencing method, reveals non-genetic gene-expression heterogeneity.	Development of a highly reproducible and sensitive single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) method would facilitate the understanding of the biological roles and underlying mechanisms of non-genetic cellular heterogeneity. In this study, we report a novel single-cell RNA-seq method called Quartz-Seq that has a simpler protocol and higher reproducibility and sensitivity than existing methods. We show that single-cell Quartz-Seq can quantitatively detect various kinds of non-genetic cellular heterogeneity, and can detect different cell types and different cell-cycle phases of a single cell type. Moreover, this method can comprehensively reveal gene-expression heterogeneity between single cells of the same cell type in the same cell-cycle phase.
34999749	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scPretrain: multi-task self-supervised learning for cell-type classification.	MOTIVATION: Rapidly generated scRNA-seq datasets enable us to understand cellular differences and the function of each individual cell at single-cell resolution. Cell-type classification, which aims at characterizing and labeling groups of cells according to their gene expression, is one of the most important steps for single-cell analysis. To facilitate the manual curation process, supervised learning methods have been used to automatically classify cells. Most of the existing supervised learning approaches only utilize annotated cells in the training step while ignoring the more abundant unannotated cells. In this article, we proposed scPretrain, a multi-task self-supervised learning approach that jointly considers annotated and unannotated cells for cell-type classification. scPretrain consists of a pre-training step and a fine-tuning step. In the pre-training step, scPretrain uses a multi-task learning framework to train a feature extraction encoder based on each dataset's pseudo-labels, where only unannotated cells are used. In the fine-tuning step, scPretrain fine-tunes this feature extraction encoder using the limited annotated cells in a new dataset. RESULTS: We evaluated scPretrain on 60 diverse datasets from different technologies, species and organs, and obtained a significant improvement on both cell-type classification and cell clustering. Moreover, the representations obtained by scPretrain in the pre-training step also enhanced the performance of conventional classifiers, such as random forest, logistic regression and support-vector machines. scPretrain is able to effectively utilize the massive amount of unlabeled data and be applied to annotating increasingly generated scRNA-seq datasets. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The data and code underlying this article are available in scPretrain: Multi-task self-supervised learning for cell type classification, at https://github.com/ruiyi-zhang/scPretrain and https://zenodo.org/record/5802306. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
35449415	2022	Nature biotechnology	DestVI identifies continuums of cell types in spatial transcriptomics data.	Most spatial transcriptomics technologies are limited by their resolution, with spot sizes larger than that of a single cell. Although joint analysis with single-cell RNA sequencing can alleviate this problem, current methods are limited to assessing discrete cell types, revealing the proportion of cell types inside each spot. To identify continuous variation of the transcriptome within cells of the same type, we developed Deconvolution of Spatial Transcriptomics profiles using Variational Inference (DestVI). Using simulations, we demonstrate that DestVI outperforms existing methods for estimating gene expression for every cell type inside every spot. Applied to a study of infected lymph nodes and of a mouse tumor model, DestVI provides high-resolution, accurate spatial characterization of the cellular organization of these tissues and identifies cell-type-specific changes in gene expression between different tissue regions or between conditions. DestVI is available as part of the open-source software package scvi-tools ( https://scvi-tools.org ).
27530426	2016	Nucleic acids research	Selective single cell isolation for genomics using microraft arrays.	Genomic methods are used increasingly to interrogate the individual cells that compose specific tissues. However, current methods for single cell isolation struggle to phenotypically differentiate specific cells in a heterogeneous population and rely primarily on the use of fluorescent markers. Many cellular phenotypes of interest are too complex to be measured by this approach, making it difficult to connect genotype and phenotype at the level of individual cells. Here we demonstrate that microraft arrays, which are arrays containing thousands of individual cell culture sites, can be used to select single cells based on a variety of phenotypes, such as cell surface markers, cell proliferation and drug response. We then show that a common genomic procedure, RNA-seq, can be readily adapted to the single cells isolated from these rafts. We show that data generated using microrafts and our modified RNA-seq protocol compared favorably with the Fluidigm C1. We then used microraft arrays to select pancreatic cancer cells that proliferate in spite of cytotoxic drug treatment. Our single cell RNA-seq data identified several expected and novel gene expression changes associated with early drug resistance.
37308294	2023	Genome research	Accurate integration of multiple heterogeneous single-cell RNA-seq data sets by learning contrastive biological variation.	For most biological and medical applications of single-cell transcriptomics, an integrative study of multiple heterogeneous single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data sets is crucial. However, present approaches are unable to integrate diverse data sets from various biological conditions effectively because of the confounding effects of biological and technical differences. We introduce single-cell integration (scInt), an integration method based on accurate, robust cell-cell similarity construction and unified contrastive biological variation learning from multiple scRNA-seq data sets. scInt provides a flexible and effective approach to transfer knowledge from the already integrated reference to the query. We show that scInt outperforms 10 other cutting-edge approaches using both simulated and real data sets, particularly in the case of complex experimental designs. Application of scInt to mouse developing tracheal epithelial data shows its ability to integrate development trajectories from different developmental stages. Furthermore, scInt successfully identifies functionally distinct condition-specific cell subpopulations in single-cell heterogeneous samples from a variety of biological conditions.
26653891	2015	Genome biology	MAST: a flexible statistical framework for assessing transcriptional changes and characterizing heterogeneity in single-cell RNA sequencing data.	Single-cell transcriptomics reveals gene expression heterogeneity but suffers from stochastic dropout and characteristic bimodal expression distributions in which expression is either strongly non-zero or non-detectable. We propose a two-part, generalized linear model for such bimodal data that parameterizes both of these features. We argue that the cellular detection rate, the fraction of genes expressed in a cell, should be adjusted for as a source of nuisance variation. Our model provides gene set enrichment analysis tailored to single-cell data. It provides insights into how networks of co-expressed genes evolve across an experimental treatment. MAST is available at https://github.com/RGLab/MAST .
40833274	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	HiCat: a semi-supervised approach for cell type annotation.	Existing cell type annotation methods face significant hurdles: supervised approaches often fail to differentiate between novel cell types not present in reference data, while unsupervised techniques can suffer from cluster impurity and difficulties in robustly distinguishing multiple distinct unknown cell populations. This critical gap motivated the development of HiCat, a semi-supervised pipeline specifically designed to overcome these limitations. HiCat is a semi-supervised pipeline that integrates both approaches, leveraging reference (labeled) and query (unlabeled) genomic data to simultaneously enhance annotation accuracy for known cell types and improve the discovery and differentiation of novel ones. HiCat follows a structured pipeline: (1) removing batch effects and generate a low-dimensional embedding; (2) nonlinear dimensionality reduction for capturing key patterns; (3) unsupervised clustering for proposing novel cell type candidates; (4) merging multi-resolution features from previous steps into a condensed feature space; (5) training a classifier on reference data for supervised annotation; and (6) resolving inconsistencies between supervised predictions and unsupervised clusters to finalize annotations, particularly for unseen types. Performance was evaluated across 10 public genomic datasets and perform a case study on a molecular cell atlas of the human lung. HiCat demonstrated superior performance in both known cell type classification and novel cell type identification. In benchmark evaluations, HiCat consistently outperformed existing methods, critically excelling in identifying and distinguishing multiple novel cell types. HiCat presents a robust framework for scRNA-seq cell annotation, improving classification accuracy and novel type identification. In addition, it provides a scalable and transferable solution for biomedical research, directly addressing key challenges in automated cell annotation.
40316422	2025	Genome research	Harnessing agent-based frameworks in CellAgentChat to unravel cell-cell interactions from single-cell and spatial transcriptomics.	Understanding cell-cell interactions (CCIs) is essential yet challenging owing to the inherent intricacy and diversity of cellular dynamics. Existing approaches often analyze global patterns of CCIs using statistical frameworks, missing the nuances of individual cell behavior owing to their focus on aggregate data. This makes them insensitive in complex environments where the detailed dynamics of cell interactions matter. We introduce CellAgentChat, an agent-based model (ABM) designed to decipher CCIs from single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics data. This approach models biological systems as collections of autonomous agents governed by biologically inspired principles and rules. Validated across eight diverse single-cell data sets, CellAgentChat demonstrates its effectiveness in detecting intricate signaling events across different cell populations. Moreover, CellAgentChat offers the ability to generate animated visualizations of single-cell interactions and provides flexibility in modifying agent behavior rules, facilitating thorough exploration of both close and distant cellular communications. Furthermore, CellAgentChat leverages ABM features to enable intuitive in silico perturbations via agent rule modifications, facilitating the development of novel intervention strategies. This ABM method unlocks an in-depth understanding of cellular signaling interactions across various biological contexts, thereby enhancing in silico studies for cellular communication-based therapies.
32770205	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	Spatial molecular profiling: platforms, applications and analysis tools.	Molecular profiling technologies, such as genome sequencing and proteomics, have transformed biomedical research, but most such technologies require tissue dissociation, which leads to loss of tissue morphology and spatial information. Recent developments in spatial molecular profiling technologies have enabled the comprehensive molecular characterization of cells while keeping their spatial and morphological contexts intact. Molecular profiling data generate deep characterizations of the genetic, transcriptional and proteomic events of cells, while tissue images capture the spatial locations, organizations and interactions of the cells together with their morphology features. These data, together with cell and tissue imaging data, provide unprecedented opportunities to study tissue heterogeneity and cell spatial organization. This review aims to provide an overview of these recent developments in spatial molecular profiling technologies and the corresponding computational methods developed for analyzing such data.
31501871	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scds: computational annotation of doublets in single-cell RNA sequencing data.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies enable the study of transcriptional heterogeneity at the resolution of individual cells and have an increasing impact on biomedical research. However, it is known that these methods sometimes wrongly consider two or more cells as single cells, and that a number of so-called doublets is present in the output of such experiments. Treating doublets as single cells in downstream analyses can severely bias a study's conclusions, and therefore computational strategies for the identification of doublets are needed. RESULTS: With scds, we propose two new approaches for in silico doublet identification: Co-expression based doublet scoring (cxds) and binary classification based doublet scoring (bcds). The co-expression based approach, cxds, utilizes binarized (absence/presence) gene expression data and, employing a binomial model for the co-expression of pairs of genes, yields interpretable doublet annotations. bcds, on the other hand, uses a binary classification approach to discriminate artificial doublets from original data. We apply our methods and existing computational doublet identification approaches to four datasets with experimental doublet annotations and find that our methods perform at least as well as the state of the art, at comparably little computational cost. We observe appreciable differences between methods and across datasets and that no approach dominates all others. In summary, scds presents a scalable, competitive approach that allows for doublet annotation of datasets with thousands of cells in a matter of seconds. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: scds is implemented as a Bioconductor R package (doi: 10.18129/B9.bioc.scds). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
39494609	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Multi-level multi-view network based on structural contrastive learning for scRNA-seq data clustering.	Clustering plays a crucial role in analyzing scRNA-seq data and has been widely used in studying cellular distribution over the past few years. However, the high dimensionality and complexity of scRNA-seq data pose significant challenges to achieving accurate clustering from a singular perspective. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach, called multi-level multi-view network based on structural consistency contrastive learning (scMMN), for scRNA-seq data clustering. Firstly, the proposed method constructs shallow views through the $k$-nearest neighbor ($k$NN) and diffusion mapping (DM) algorithms, and then deep views are generated by utilizing the graph Laplacian filters. These deep multi-view data serve as the input for representation learning. To improve the clustering performance of scRNA-seq data, contrastive learning is introduced to enhance the discrimination ability of our network. Specifically, we construct a group contrastive loss for representation features and a structural consistency contrastive loss for structural relationships. Extensive experiments on eight real scRNA-seq datasets show that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in scRNA-seq data clustering tasks. Our source code has already been available at https://github.com/szq0816/scMMN.
27121950	2016	Genome biology	CEL-Seq2: sensitive highly-multiplexed single-cell RNA-Seq.	Single-cell transcriptomics requires a method that is sensitive, accurate, and reproducible. Here, we present CEL-Seq2, a modified version of our CEL-Seq method, with threefold higher sensitivity, lower costs, and less hands-on time. We implemented CEL-Seq2 on Fluidigm's C1 system, providing its first single-cell, on-chip barcoding method, and we detected gene expression changes accompanying the progression through the cell cycle in mouse fibroblast cells. We also compare with Smart-Seq to demonstrate CEL-Seq2's increased sensitivity relative to other available methods. Collectively, the improvements make CEL-Seq2 uniquely suited to single-cell RNA-Seq analysis in terms of economics, resolution, and ease of use.
38777607	2024	Genome research	Machine learning identifies activation of RUNX/AP-1 as drivers of mesenchymal and fibrotic regulatory programs in gastric cancer.	Gastric cancer (GC) is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and is a heterogeneous disease. Among GC subtypes, the mesenchymal phenotype (Mes-like) is more invasive than the epithelial phenotype (Epi-like). Although gene expression of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been studied, the regulatory landscape shaping this process is not fully understood. Here we use ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data from a compendium of GC cell lines and primary tumors to detect drivers of regulatory state changes and their transcriptional responses. Using the ATAC-seq data, we developed a machine learning approach to determine the transcription factors (TFs) regulating the subtypes of GC. We identified TFs driving the mesenchymal (RUNX2, ZEB1, SNAI2, AP-1 dimer) and the epithelial (GATA4, GATA6, KLF5, HNF4A, FOXA2, GRHL2) states in GC. We identified DNA copy number alterations associated with dysregulation of these TFs, specifically deletion of GATA4 and amplification of MAPK9 Comparisons with bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data sets identified activation toward fibroblast-like epigenomic and expression signatures in Mes-like GC. The activation of this mesenchymal fibrotic program is associated with differentially accessible DNA cis-regulatory elements flanking upregulated mesenchymal genes. These findings establish a map of TF activity in GC and highlight the role of copy number driven alterations in shaping epigenomic regulatory programs as potential drivers of GC heterogeneity and progression.
34011578	2021	Genome research	Targeted single-cell RNA sequencing of transcription factors enhances the identification of cell types and trajectories.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a widely used method for identifying cell types and trajectories in biologically heterogeneous samples, but it is limited in its detection and quantification of lowly expressed genes. This results in missing important biological signals, such as the expression of key transcription factors (TFs) driving cellular differentiation. We show that targeted sequencing of  approximately 1000 TFs (scCapture-seq) in iPSC-derived neuronal cultures greatly improves the biological information garnered from scRNA-seq. Increased TF resolution enhanced cell type identification, developmental trajectories, and gene regulatory networks. This allowed us to resolve differences among neuronal populations, which were generated in two different laboratories using the same differentiation protocol. ScCapture-seq improved TF-gene regulatory network inference and thus identified divergent patterns of neurogenesis into either excitatory cortical neurons or inhibitory interneurons. Furthermore, scCapture-seq revealed a role for of retinoic acid signaling in the developmental divergence between these different neuronal populations. Our results show that TF targeting improves the characterization of human cellular models and allows identification of the essential differences between cellular populations, which would otherwise be missed in traditional scRNA-seq. scCapture-seq TF targeting represents a cost-effective enhancement of scRNA-seq, which could be broadly applied to improve scRNA-seq resolution.
33611343	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	Evaluation of machine learning approaches for cell-type identification from single-cell transcriptomics data.	Single-cell transcriptomics technologies have vast potential in advancing our understanding of cellular heterogeneity in complex tissues. While methods to interpret single-cell transcriptomics data are developing rapidly, challenges in most analysis pipeline still remain, and the major limitation is a reliance on manual annotations for cell-type identification that is time-consuming, irreproducible, and sometimes lack canonical markers for certain cell types. There is a growing realization of the potential of machine learning models as a supervised classification approach that can significantly aid decision-making processes for cell-type identification. In this work, we performed a comprehensive and impartial evaluation of 10 machine learning models that automatically assign cell phenotypes. The performance of classification methods is estimated by using 20 publicly accessible single-cell RNA sequencing datasets with different sizes, technologies, species and levels of complexity. The performance of each model for within dataset (intra-dataset) and across datasets (inter-dataset) experiments based on the classification accuracy and computation time are both evaluated. Besides, the sensitivity to the number of input features, different annotation levels and dataset complexity was also been estimated. Results showed that most classifiers perform well on a variety of datasets with decreased accuracy for complex datasets, while the Linear Support Vector Machine (linear-SVM) and Logistic Regression classifier models have the best overall performance with remarkably fast computation time. Our work provides a guideline for researchers to select and apply suitable machine learning-based classification models in their analysis workflows and sheds some light on the potential direction of future improvement on automated cell phenotype classification tools based on the single-cell sequencing data.
32231336	2020	Nature biotechnology	Combinatorial single-cell CRISPR screens by direct guide RNA capture and targeted sequencing.	Single-cell CRISPR screens enable the exploration of mammalian gene function and genetic regulatory networks. However, use of this technology has been limited by reliance on indirect indexing of single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs). Here we present direct-capture Perturb-seq, a versatile screening approach in which expressed sgRNAs are sequenced alongside single-cell transcriptomes. Direct-capture Perturb-seq enables detection of multiple distinct sgRNA sequences from individual cells and thus allows pooled single-cell CRISPR screens to be easily paired with combinatorial perturbation libraries that contain dual-guide expression vectors. We demonstrate the utility of this approach for high-throughput investigations of genetic interactions and, leveraging this ability, dissect epistatic interactions between cholesterol biogenesis and DNA repair. Using direct capture Perturb-seq, we also show that targeting individual genes with multiple sgRNAs per cell improves efficacy of CRISPR interference and activation, facilitating the use of compact, highly active CRISPR libraries for single-cell screens. Last, we show that hybridization-based target enrichment permits sensitive, specific sequencing of informative transcripts from single-cell RNA-seq experiments.
39675380	2025	Nucleic acids research	A comprehensive analysis framework for evaluating commercial single-cell RNA sequencing technologies.	This study examined nine prominent commercially available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) kits across four technology groups. Each kit was characterized using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a single donor, which enabled consistent assessment of factors such as analytical performance, protocol duration and cost. The Chromium Fixed RNA Profiling kit from 10x Genomics, with its probe-based RNA detection method, demonstrated the best overall performance. The Rhapsody WTA kit from Becton Dickinson exhibited a balance between performance and cost. Importantly, we introduce the read utilization metric, which differentiates scRNA-seq kits based on the efficiency of converting sequencing reads into usable counts. Thus, read utilization is an important feature that substantially impacts sensitivity and cost. With data from 169, 262 cells, our work provides a comprehensive comparison of commercial scRNA-seq technologies to facilitate the effective implementation of single-cell studies.
41206950	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	GT-GRN: a graph transformer framework for enhanced gene regulatory network inference via multimodal embedding of expression data and existing network knowledge.	The inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is critical for understanding the regulatory mechanisms underlying cellular development, functional specialization, and disease progression. Predicting regulatory gene interactions-often framed as a link prediction task-is a foundational step toward modeling cellular behavior. However, GRN inference from gene coexpression data alone is limited by noise, low interpretability, and difficulty in capturing indirect regulatory signals. Additionally, challenges such as data sparsity, nonlinearity, and complex gene interactions hinder accurate network reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose, a novel graph transformer (GT) based framework (GT-GRN) that enhances GRN inference by integrating multimodal gene embeddings. Our method combines three complementary sources of information: (i) autoencoder-based embeddings, which capture high-dimensional gene expression patterns while preserving biological signals; (ii) structural embeddings, derived from previously inferred GRNs and encoded via random walks and a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) based language model to learn global gene representations; (iii) positional encodings, capturing each gene's role within the network topology . These heterogeneous features are fused and processed using a GT, allowing the joint modeling of both local and global regulatory structures. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that GT-GRN outperforms existing GRN inference methods in predictive accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, it reconstructs cell-type-specific GRNs with high fidelity and produces gene embeddings that generalize to other tasks such as cell-type annotation.
39535033	2024	Nucleic acids research	Epigenetic characterization of adult rhesus monkey spermatogonial stem cells identifies key regulators of stem cell homeostasis.	Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) play crucial roles in the preservation of male fertility. However, successful ex vivo expansion of authentic human SSCs remains elusive due to the inadequate understanding of SSC homeostasis regulation. Using rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) as a representative model, we characterized SSCs and progenitor subsets through single-cell RNA sequencing using a cell-specific network approach. We also profiled chromatin status and major histone modifications (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27ac, H3K27me3 and H3K9me3), and subsequently mapped promoters and active enhancers in TSPAN33+ putative SSCs. Comparing the epigenetic changes between fresh TSPAN33+ cells and cultured TSPAN33+ cells (resembling progenitors), we identified the regulatory elements with higher activity in SSCs, and the potential transcription factors and signaling pathways implicated in SSC regulation. Specifically, TGF-beta signaling is activated in monkey putative SSCs. We provided evidence supporting its role in promoting self-renewal of monkey SSCs in culture. Overall, this study outlines the epigenetic landscapes of monkey SSCs and provides clues for optimization of the culture condition for primate SSCs expansion.
31799601	2020	Nucleic acids research	Allele-specific single-cell RNA sequencing reveals different architectures of intrinsic and extrinsic gene expression noises.	Gene expression noise refers to the variation of the expression level of a gene among isogenic cells in the same environment, and has two sources: extrinsic noise arising from the disparity of the cell state and intrinsic noise arising from the stochastic process of gene expression in the same cell state. Due to the low throughput of the existing method for measuring the two noise components, the architectures of intrinsic and extrinsic expression noises remain elusive. Using allele-specific single-cell RNA sequencing, we here estimate the two noise components of 3975 genes in mouse fibroblast cells. Our analyses verify predicted influences of several factors such as the TATA-box and microRNA targeting on intrinsic or extrinsic noises and reveal gene function-associated noise trends implicating the action of natural selection. These findings unravel differential regulations, optimizations, and biological consequences of intrinsic and extrinsic noises and can aid the construction of desired synthetic circuits.
32898151	2020	PLoS computational biology	VALERIE: Visual-based inspection of alternative splicing events at single-cell resolution.	We present VALERIE (Visualising alternative splicing events from single-cell ribonucleic acid-sequencing experiments), an R package for visualising alternative splicing events at single-cell resolution. To explore any given specified genomic region, corresponding to an alternative splicing event, VALERIE generates an ensemble of informative plots to visualise cell-to-cell heterogeneity of alternative splicing profiles across single cells and performs statistical tests to compare percent spliced-in (PSI) values across the user-defined groups of cells. Among the features available, VALERIE displays PSI values, in lieu of read coverage, which is more suitable for representing alternative splicing profiles for a large number of samples typically generated by single-cell RNA-sequencing experiments. VALERIE is available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN): https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/VALERIE/index.html.
28114287	2017	Nature methods	Single-cell mRNA quantification and differential analysis with Census.	Single-cell gene expression studies promise to reveal rare cell types and cryptic states, but the high variability of single-cell RNA-seq measurements frustrates efforts to assay transcriptional differences between cells. We introduce the Census algorithm to convert relative RNA-seq expression levels into relative transcript counts without the need for experimental spike-in controls. Analyzing changes in relative transcript counts led to dramatic improvements in accuracy compared to normalized read counts and enabled new statistical tests for identifying developmentally regulated genes. Census counts can be analyzed with widely used regression techniques to reveal changes in cell-fate-dependent gene expression, splicing patterns and allelic imbalances. We reanalyzed single-cell data from several developmental and disease studies, and demonstrate that Census enabled robust analysis at multiple layers of gene regulation. Census is freely available through our updated single-cell analysis toolkit, Monocle 2.
34534204	2021	PLoS computational biology	Transcriptomic entropy benchmarks stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte maturation against endogenous tissue at single cell level.	The immaturity of pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived tissues has emerged as a universal problem for their biomedical applications. While efforts have been made to generate adult-like cells from PSCs, direct benchmarking of PSC-derived tissues against in vivo development has not been established. Thus, maturation status is often assessed on an ad-hoc basis. Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers a promising solution, though cross-study comparison is limited by dataset-specific batch effects. Here, we developed a novel approach to quantify PSC-derived cardiomyocyte (CM) maturation through transcriptomic entropy. Transcriptomic entropy is robust across datasets regardless of differences in isolation protocols, library preparation, and other potential batch effects. With this new model, we analyzed over 45 scRNA-seq datasets and over 52,000 CMs, and established a cross-study, cross-species CM maturation reference. This reference enabled us to directly compare PSC-CMs with the in vivo developmental trajectory and thereby to quantify PSC-CM maturation status. We further found that our entropy-based approach can be used for other cell types, including pancreatic beta cells and hepatocytes. Our study presents a biologically relevant and interpretable metric for quantifying PSC-derived tissue maturation, and is extensible to numerous tissue engineering contexts.
37280190	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	scDFC: A deep fusion clustering method for single-cell RNA-seq data.	Clustering methods have been widely used in single-cell RNA-seq data for investigating tumor heterogeneity. Since traditional clustering methods fail to capture the high-dimension methods, deep clustering methods have drawn increasing attention these years due to their promising strengths on the task. However, existing methods consider either the attribute information of each cell or the structure information between different cells. In other words, they cannot sufficiently make use of all of this information simultaneously. To this end, we propose a novel single-cell deep fusion clustering model, which contains two modules, i.e. an attributed feature clustering module and a structure-attention feature clustering module. More concretely, two elegantly designed autoencoders are built to handle both features regardless of their data types. Experiments have demonstrated the validity of the proposed approach, showing that it is efficient to fuse attributes, structure, and attention information on single-cell RNA-seq data. This work will be further beneficial for investigating cell subpopulations and tumor microenvironment. The Python implementation of our work is now freely available at https://github.com/DayuHuu/scDFC.
30154223	2018	Genome research	Single-cell RNA-sequencing reveals the existence of naive and primed pluripotency in pre-implantation rhesus monkey embryos.	Naive pluripotency exists in epiblast cells of mouse pre-implantation embryos. However, whether the naive pluripotency is transient or nonexistent in primate embryos remains unclear. Using RNA-seq in single blastomeres from 16-cell embryos through to hatched blastocysts of rhesus monkey, we constructed the lineage segregation roadmap in which the specification of trophectoderm, epiblast, and primitive endoderm is initiated simultaneously at the early blastocyst stage. Importantly, we uncovered the existence of distinct pluripotent states in monkey pre-implantation embryos. At the early- and middle-blastocyst stages, the epiblast cells have the transcriptome features of naive pluripotency, whereas they display a continuum of primed pluripotency characteristics at the late and hatched blastocyst stages. Moreover, we identified potential regulators that might play roles in the transition from naive to primed pluripotency. Thus, our study suggests the transient existence of naive pluripotency in primates and proposes an ideal time window for derivation of primate embryonic stem cells with naive pluripotency.
39026254	2024	Genome biology	Leveraging neighborhood representations of single-cell data to achieve sensitive DE testing with miloDE.	Single-cell RNA-sequencing enables testing for differential expression (DE) between conditions at a cell type level. While powerful, one of the limitations of such approaches is that the sensitivity of DE testing is dictated by the sensitivity of clustering, which is often suboptimal. To overcome this, we present miloDE-a cluster-free framework for DE testing (available as an open-source R package). We illustrate the performance of miloDE on both simulated and real data. Using miloDE, we identify a transient hemogenic endothelia-like state in mouse embryos lacking Tal1 and detect distinct programs during macrophage activation in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
36083008	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	A machine learning-based method for automatically identifying novel cells in annotating single-cell RNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been widely used to decompose complex tissues into functionally distinct cell types. The first and usually the most important step of scRNA-seq data analysis is to accurately annotate the cell labels. In recent years, many supervised annotation methods have been developed and shown to be more convenient and accurate than unsupervised cell clustering. One challenge faced by all the supervised annotation methods is the identification of the novel cell type, which is defined as the cell type that is not present in the training data, only exists in the testing data. Existing methods usually label the cells simply based on the correlation coefficients or confidence scores, which sometimes results in an excessive number of unlabeled cells. RESULTS: We developed a straightforward yet effective method combining autoencoder with iterative feature selection to automatically identify novel cells from scRNA-seq data. Our method trains an autoencoder with the labeled training data and applies the autoencoder to the testing data to obtain reconstruction errors. By iteratively selecting features that demonstrate a bi-modal pattern and reclustering the cells using the selected feature, our method can accurately identify novel cells that are not present in the training data. We further combined this approach with a support vector machine to provide a complete solution for annotating the full range of cell types. Extensive numerical experiments using five real scRNA-seq datasets demonstrated favorable performance of the proposed method over existing methods serving similar purposes. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Our R software package CAMLU is publicly available through the Zenodo repository (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7054422) or GitHub repository (https://github.com/ziyili20/CAMLU). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
37096588	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Benchmarking of analytical combinations for COVID-19 outcome prediction using single-cell RNA sequencing data.	The advances of single-cell transcriptomic technologies have led to increasing use of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data in large-scale patient cohort studies. The resulting high-dimensional data can be summarized and incorporated into patient outcome prediction models in several ways; however, there is a pressing need to understand the impact of analytical decisions on such model quality. In this study, we evaluate the impact of analytical choices on model choices, ensemble learning strategies and integrate approaches on patient outcome prediction using five scRNA-seq COVID-19 datasets. First, we examine the difference in performance between using single-view feature space versus multi-view feature space. Next, we survey multiple learning platforms from classical machine learning to modern deep learning methods. Lastly, we compare different integration approaches when combining datasets is necessary. Through benchmarking such analytical combinations, our study highlights the power of ensemble learning, consistency among different learning methods and robustness to dataset normalization when using multiple datasets as the model input.
35561293	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	FIRM: Flexible integration of single-cell RNA-sequencing data for large-scale multi-tissue cell atlas datasets.	Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is being used extensively to measure the mRNA expression of individual cells from deconstructed tissues, organs and even entire organisms to generate cell atlas references, leading to discoveries of novel cell types and deeper insight into biological trajectories. These massive datasets are usually collected from many samples using different scRNA-seq technology platforms, including the popular SMART-Seq2 (SS2) and 10X platforms. Inherent heterogeneities between platforms, tissues and other batch effects make scRNA-seq data difficult to compare and integrate, especially in large-scale cell atlas efforts; yet, accurate integration is essential for gaining deeper insights into cell biology. We present FIRM, a re-scaling algorithm which accounts for the effects of cell type compositions, and achieve accurate integration of scRNA-seq datasets across multiple tissue types, platforms and experimental batches. Compared with existing state-of-the-art integration methods, FIRM provides accurate mixing of shared cell type identities and superior preservation of original structure without overcorrection, generating robust integrated datasets for downstream exploration and analysis. FIRM is also a facile way to transfer cell type labels and annotations from one dataset to another, making it a reliable and versatile tool for scRNA-seq analysis, especially for cell atlas data integration.
37770709	2023	Nature methods	Learning single-cell perturbation responses using neural optimal transport.	Understanding and predicting molecular responses in single cells upon chemical, genetic or mechanical perturbations is a core question in biology. Obtaining single-cell measurements typically requires the cells to be destroyed. This makes learning heterogeneous perturbation responses challenging as we only observe unpaired distributions of perturbed or non-perturbed cells. Here we leverage the theory of optimal transport and the recent advent of input convex neural architectures to present CellOT, a framework for learning the response of individual cells to a given perturbation by mapping these unpaired distributions. CellOT outperforms current methods at predicting single-cell drug responses, as profiled by scRNA-seq and a multiplexed protein-imaging technology. Further, we illustrate that CellOT generalizes well on unseen settings by (1) predicting the scRNA-seq responses of holdout patients with lupus exposed to interferon-beta and patients with glioblastoma to panobinostat; (2) inferring lipopolysaccharide responses across different species; and (3) modeling the hematopoietic developmental trajectories of different subpopulations.
38191932	2024	Nature methods	A fast, scalable and versatile tool for analysis of single-cell omics data.	Single-cell omics technologies have revolutionized the study of gene regulation in complex tissues. A major computational challenge in analyzing these datasets is to project the large-scale and high-dimensional data into low-dimensional space while retaining the relative relationships between cells. This low dimension embedding is necessary to decompose cellular heterogeneity and reconstruct cell-type-specific gene regulatory programs. Traditional dimensionality reduction techniques, however, face challenges in computational efficiency and in comprehensively addressing cellular diversity across varied molecular modalities. Here we introduce a nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithm, embodied in the Python package SnapATAC2, which not only achieves a more precise capture of single-cell omics data heterogeneities but also ensures efficient runtime and memory usage, scaling linearly with the number of cells. Our algorithm demonstrates exceptional performance, scalability and versatility across diverse single-cell omics datasets, including single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing, single-cell RNA sequencing, single-cell Hi-C and single-cell multi-omics datasets, underscoring its utility in advancing single-cell analysis.
35325048	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	TWO-SIGMA-G: a new competitive gene set testing framework for scRNA-seq data accounting for inter-gene and cell-cell correlation.	We propose TWO-SIGMA-G, a competitive gene set test for scRNA-seq data. TWO-SIGMA-G uses a mixed-effects regression model based on our previously published TWO-SIGMA to test for differential expression at the gene-level. This regression-based model provides flexibility and rigor at the gene-level in (1) handling complex experimental designs, (2) accounting for the correlation between biological replicates and (3) accommodating the distribution of scRNA-seq data to improve statistical inference. Moreover, TWO-SIGMA-G uses a novel approach to adjust for inter-gene-correlation (IGC) at the set-level to control the set-level false positive rate. Simulations demonstrate that TWO-SIGMA-G preserves type-I error and increases power in the presence of IGC compared with other methods. Application to two datasets identified HIV-associated interferon pathways in xenograft mice and pathways associated with Alzheimer's disease progression in humans.
39570606	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	FastTENET: an accelerated TENET algorithm based on manycore computing in Python.	SUMMARY: TENET reconstructs gene regulatory networks from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data using the transfer entropy (TE), and works successfully on a variety of scRNAseq data. However, TENET is limited by its long computation time for large datasets. To address this limitation, we propose FastTENET, an array-computing version of TENET algorithm optimized for acceleration on manycore processors such as GPUs. FastTENET counts the unique patterns of joint events to compute the TE based on array computing. Compared to TENET, FastTENET achieves up to 973x performance improvement.

BACKGROUND: Analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data has revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity, yet current approaches face challenges in efficiency, interpretability, and connecting molecular insights to therapeutic applications. Despite advances in deep learning methods, identifying cell-type-specific functional gene sets remains difficult. RESULTS: In this study, we present scKAN, an interpretable framework for scRNA-seq analysis with two primary goals: accurate cell-type annotation and the discovery of cell-type-specific marker genes and gene sets. The key innovation is using the learnable activation curves of the Kolmogorov-Arnold network to model gene-to-cell relationships. This approach provides a more direct way to visualize and interpret these specific interactions compared to the aggregated weighting schemes typical of attention mechanisms. This architecture achieves superior performance in cell-type annotation, with a 6.63% improvement in macro F1 score over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, it enables the systematic identification of functionally coherent cell-type-specific gene sets. We demonstrate the framework's translational potential through a case study on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, where gene signatures identified by scKAN led to a potential drug repurposing candidate, whose binding stability was supported by molecular dynamics simulations. CONCLUSIONS: Our work establishes scKAN as an efficient and interpretable framework that effectively bridges single-cell analysis with drug discovery. By combining lightweight architecture with the ability to uncover nuanced biological patterns, our approach offers an interpretable method for translating large-scale single-cell data into actionable therapeutic strategies. This approach provides a robust foundation for accelerating the identification of cell-type-specific targets in complex diseases.
38261340	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	GMFGRN: a matrix factorization and graph neural network approach for gene regulatory network inference.	The recent advances of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have enabled reliable profiling of gene expression at the single-cell level, providing opportunities for accurate inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) on scRNA-seq data. Most methods for inferring GRNs suffer from the inability to eliminate transitive interactions or necessitate expensive computational resources. To address these, we present a novel method, termed GMFGRN, for accurate graph neural network (GNN)-based GRN inference from scRNA-seq data. GMFGRN employs GNN for matrix factorization and learns representative embeddings for genes. For transcription factor-gene pairs, it utilizes the learned embeddings to determine whether they interact with each other. The extensive suite of benchmarking experiments encompassing eight static scRNA-seq datasets alongside several state-of-the-art methods demonstrated mean improvements of 1.9 and 2.5% over the runner-up in area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). In addition, across four time-series datasets, maximum enhancements of 2.4 and 1.3% in AUROC and AUPRC were observed in comparison to the runner-up. Moreover, GMFGRN requires significantly less training time and memory consumption, with time and memory consumed <10% compared to the second-best method. These findings underscore the substantial potential of GMFGRN in the inference of GRNs. It is publicly available at https://github.com/Lishuoyy/GMFGRN.
30821315	2019	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	SinNLRR: a robust subspace clustering method for cell type detection by non-negative and low-rank representation.	MOTIVATION: The development of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides a new perspective to study biological problems at the single-cell level. One of the key issues in scRNA-seq analysis is to resolve the heterogeneity and diversity of cells, which is to cluster the cells into several groups. However, many existing clustering methods are designed to analyze bulk RNA-seq data, it is urgent to develop the new scRNA-seq clustering methods. Moreover, the high noise in scRNA-seq data also brings a lot of challenges to computational methods. RESULTS: In this study, we propose a novel scRNA-seq cell type detection method based on similarity learning, called SinNLRR. The method is motivated by the self-expression of the cells with the same group. Specifically, we impose the non-negative and low rank structure on the similarity matrix. We apply alternating direction method of multipliers to solve the optimization problem and propose an adaptive penalty selection method to avoid the sensitivity to the parameters. The learned similarity matrix could be incorporated with spectral clustering, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding for visualization and Laplace score for prioritizing gene markers. In contrast to other scRNA-seq clustering methods, our method achieves more robust and accurate results on different datasets. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Our MATLAB implementation of SinNLRR is available at, https://github.com/zrq0123/SinNLRR. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
31510660	2019	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Comprehensive evaluation of transcriptome-based cell-type quantification methods for immuno-oncology.	MOTIVATION: The composition and density of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) profoundly influence tumor progression and success of anti-cancer therapies. Flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry staining or single-cell sequencing are often unavailable such that we rely on computational methods to estimate the immune-cell composition from bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data. Various methods have been proposed recently, yet their capabilities and limitations have not been evaluated systematically. A general guideline leading the research community through cell type deconvolution is missing. RESULTS: We developed a systematic approach for benchmarking such computational methods and assessed the accuracy of tools at estimating nine different immune- and stromal cells from bulk RNA-seq samples. We used a single-cell RNA-seq dataset of  approximately 11 000 cells from the TME to simulate bulk samples of known cell type proportions, and validated the results using independent, publicly available gold-standard estimates. This allowed us to analyze and condense the results of more than a hundred thousand predictions to provide an exhaustive evaluation across seven computational methods over nine cell types and  approximately 1800 samples from five simulated and real-world datasets. We demonstrate that computational deconvolution performs at high accuracy for well-defined cell-type signatures and propose how fuzzy cell-type signatures can be improved. We suggest that future efforts should be dedicated to refining cell population definitions and finding reliable signatures. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: A snakemake pipeline to reproduce the benchmark is available at https://github.com/grst/immune_deconvolution_benchmark. An R package allows the community to perform integrated deconvolution using different methods (https://grst.github.io/immunedeconv). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
29608179	2018	Nature biotechnology	Integrating single-cell transcriptomic data across different conditions, technologies, and species.	Computational single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) methods have been successfully applied to experiments representing a single condition, technology, or species to discover and define cellular phenotypes. However, identifying subpopulations of cells that are present across multiple data sets remains challenging. Here, we introduce an analytical strategy for integrating scRNA-seq data sets based on common sources of variation, enabling the identification of shared populations across data sets and downstream comparative analysis. We apply this approach, implemented in our R toolkit Seurat (http://satijalab.org/seurat/), to align scRNA-seq data sets of peripheral blood mononuclear cells under resting and stimulated conditions, hematopoietic progenitors sequenced using two profiling technologies, and pancreatic cell 'atlases' generated from human and mouse islets. In each case, we learn distinct or transitional cell states jointly across data sets, while boosting statistical power through integrated analysis. Our approach facilitates general comparisons of scRNA-seq data sets, potentially deepening our understanding of how distinct cell states respond to perturbation, disease, and evolution.
32767996	2020	Genome biology	Integrative analyses of single-cell transcriptome and regulome using MAESTRO.	We present Model-based AnalysEs of Transcriptome and RegulOme (MAESTRO), a comprehensive open-source computational workflow ( http://github.com/liulab-dfci/MAESTRO ) for the integrative analyses of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) data from multiple platforms. MAESTRO provides functions for pre-processing, alignment, quality control, expression and chromatin accessibility quantification, clustering, differential analysis, and annotation. By modeling gene regulatory potential from chromatin accessibilities at the single-cell level, MAESTRO outperforms the existing methods for integrating the cell clusters between scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq. Furthermore, MAESTRO supports automatic cell-type annotation using predefined cell type marker genes and identifies driver regulators from differential scRNA-seq genes and scATAC-seq peaks.
39715685	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	STCGAN: a novel cycle-consistent generative adversarial network for spatial transcriptomics cellular deconvolution.	MOTIVATION: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies have revolutionized our ability to map gene expression patterns within native tissue context, providing unprecedented insights into tissue architecture and cellular heterogeneity. However, accurately deconvolving cell-type compositions from ST spots remains challenging due to the sparse and averaged nature of ST data, which is essential for accurately depicting tissue architecture. While numerous computational methods have been developed for cell-type deconvolution and spatial distribution reconstruction, most fail to capture tissue complexity at the single-cell level, thereby limiting their applicability in practical scenarios. RESULTS: To this end, we propose a novel cycle-consistent generative adversarial network named STCGAN for cellular deconvolution in spatial transcriptomic. STCGAN first employs a cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CGAN) to pre-train on ST data, ensuring that both the mapping from ST data to latent space and its reverse mapping are consistent, capturing complex spatial gene expression patterns and learning robust latent representations. Based on the learned representation, STCGAN then optimizes a trainable cell-to-spot mapping matrix to integrate scRNA-seq data with ST data, accurately estimating cellular composition within each capture spot and effectively reconstructing the spatial distribution of cells across the tissue. To further enhance deconvolution accuracy, we incorporate spatial-aware regularization that ensures accurate cellular distribution reconstruction within the spatial context. Benchmarking against seven state-of-the-art methods on five simulated and real datasets from various tissues, STCGAN consistently delivers superior cell-type deconvolution performance. AVAILABILITY: The code of STCGAN can be downloaded from https://github.com/cs-wangbo/STCGAN and all the mentioned datasets are available on Zenodo at https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10799113.
39049052	2024	Genome biology	The vast majority of somatic mutations in plants are layer-specific.	BACKGROUND: Plant meristems are structured organs consisting of distinct layers of stem cells, which differentiate into new plant tissue. Mutations in meristematic layers can propagate into large sectors of the plant. However, the characteristics of meristematic mutations remain unclear, limiting our understanding of the genetic basis of somaclonal phenotypic variation. RESULTS: Here, we analyse the frequency and distribution of somatic mutations in an apricot tree. We separately sequence the epidermis (developing from meristem layer 1) and the flesh (developing from meristem layer 2) of several fruits sampled across the entire tree. We find that most somatic mutations (> 90%) are specific to individual layers. Interestingly, layer 1 shows a higher mutation load than layer 2, implying different mutational dynamics between the layers. The distribution of somatic mutations follows the branching of the tree. This suggests that somatic mutations are propagated to developing branches through axillary meristems. In turn, this leads us to the unexpected observation that the genomes of layer 1 of distant branches are more similar to each other than to the genomes of layer 2 of the same branches. Finally, using single-cell RNA sequencing, we demonstrate that layer-specific mutations were only transcribed in the cells of the respective layers and can form the genetic basis of somaclonal phenotypic variation. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we analyse the frequency and distribution of somatic mutations with meristematic origin. Our observations on the layer specificity of somatic mutations outline how they are distributed, how they propagate, and how they can impact clonally propagated crops.
27373736	2017	Briefings in bioinformatics	Comparison of methods to detect differentially expressed genes between single-cell populations.	We compared five statistical methods to detect differentially expressed genes between two distinct single-cell populations. Currently, it remains unclear whether differential expression methods developed originally for conventional bulk RNA-seq data can also be applied to single-cell RNA-seq data analysis. Our results in three diverse comparison settings showed marked differences between the different methods in terms of the number of detections as well as their sensitivity and specificity. They, however, did not reveal systematic benefits of the currently available single-cell-specific methods. Instead, our previously introduced reproducibility-optimization method showed good performance in all comparison settings without any single-cell-specific modifications.
38190633	2024	Genome research	Data integration and inference of gene regulation using single-cell temporal multimodal data with scTIE.	Single-cell technologies offer unprecedented opportunities to dissect gene regulatory mechanisms in context-specific ways. Although there are computational methods for extracting gene regulatory relationships from scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data, the data integration problem, essential for accurate cell type identification, has been mostly treated as a standalone challenge. Here we present scTIE, a unified method that integrates temporal multimodal data and infers regulatory relationships predictive of cellular state changes. scTIE uses an autoencoder to embed cells from all time points into a common space by using iterative optimal transport, followed by extracting interpretable information to predict cell trajectories. Using a variety of synthetic and real temporal multimodal data sets, we show scTIE achieves effective data integration while preserving more biological signals than existing methods, particularly in the presence of batch effects and noise. Furthermore, on the exemplar multiome data set we generated from differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells over time, we show scTIE captures regulatory elements highly predictive of cell transition probabilities, providing new potentials to understand the regulatory landscape driving developmental processes.
32424270	2020	Nature methods	Putative cell type discovery from single-cell gene expression data.	We present the Single-Cell Clustering Assessment Framework, a method for the automated identification of putative cell types from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. By iteratively applying a machine learning approach to a given set of cells, we simultaneously identify distinct cell groups and a weighted list of feature genes for each group. The differentially expressed feature genes discriminate the given cell group from other cells. Each such group of cells corresponds to a putative cell type or state, characterized by the feature genes as markers. Benchmarking using expert-annotated scRNA-seq datasets shows that our method automatically identifies the 'ground truth' cell assignments with high accuracy.
33313674	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	ColorCells: a database of expression, classification and functions of lncRNAs in single cells.	Although long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have significant tissue specificity, their expression and variability in single cells remain unclear. Here, we developed ColorCells (http://rna.sysu.edu.cn/colorcells/), a resource for comparative analysis of lncRNAs expression, classification and functions in single-cell RNA-Seq data. ColorCells was applied to 167 913 publicly available scRNA-Seq datasets from six species, and identified a batch of cell-specific lncRNAs. These lncRNAs show surprising levels of expression variability between different cell clusters, and has the comparable cell classification ability as known marker genes. Cell-specific lncRNAs have been identified and further validated by in vitro experiments. We found that lncRNAs are typically co-expressed with the mRNAs in the same cell cluster, which can be used to uncover lncRNAs' functions. Our study emphasizes the need to uncover lncRNAs in all cell types and shows the power of lncRNAs as novel marker genes at single cell resolution.
40658464	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	cytoKernel: robust kernel embeddings for assessing differential expression of single-cell data.	MOTIVATION: High-throughput sequencing of single-cell data can be used to rigorously evaluate cell specification and enable intricate variations between groups or conditions to be identified. Many popular existing methods for differential expression target differences in aggregate measurement (mean, median, sum) and limit their approaches to detect only global differential changes. RESULTS: We present a robust method for differential expression of single-cell data using a kernel-based score test, cytoKernel. CytoKernel is specifically designed to assess the differential expression of single-cell RNA sequencing and high-dimensional flow or mass cytometry data using the full probability distribution pattern. cytoKernel is based on kernel embeddings which employs the probability distributions of the single-cell data, by calculating the pairwise divergence/distance between distributions of subjects. It can detect both patterns involving changes in the aggregate, as well as more elusive variations that are often overlooked due to the multimodal characteristics of single-cell data. We performed extensive benchmarks across both simulated and real data sets from mass cytometry data and single-cell RNA sequencing. The cytoKernel procedure effectively controls the false discovery rate and shows favorable performance compared to existing methods. The method is able to identify more differential patterns than existing approaches. We apply cytoKernel to assess gene expression and protein marker expression differences from cell subpopulations in various publicly available single-cell RNAseq and mass cytometry datasets. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The methods described in this paper are implemented in the open-source R package cytoKernel, which is freely available from Bioconductor at http://bioconductor.org/packages/cytoKernel.
35042561	2022	Genome biology	Comparison and evaluation of statistical error models for scRNA-seq.	BACKGROUND: Heterogeneity in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data is driven by multiple sources, including biological variation in cellular state as well as technical variation introduced during experimental processing. Deconvolving these effects is a key challenge for preprocessing workflows. Recent work has demonstrated the importance and utility of count models for scRNA-seq analysis, but there is a lack of consensus on which statistical distributions and parameter settings are appropriate. RESULTS: Here, we analyze 59 scRNA-seq datasets that span a wide range of technologies, systems, and sequencing depths in order to evaluate the performance of different error models. We find that while a Poisson error model appears appropriate for sparse datasets, we observe clear evidence of overdispersion for genes with sufficient sequencing depth in all biological systems, necessitating the use of a negative binomial model. Moreover, we find that the degree of overdispersion varies widely across datasets, systems, and gene abundances, and argues for a data-driven approach for parameter estimation. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these analyses, we provide a set of recommendations for modeling variation in scRNA-seq data, particularly when using generalized linear models or likelihood-based approaches for preprocessing and downstream analysis.
38935069	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	scPLAN: a hierarchical computational framework for single transcriptomics data annotation, integration and cell-type label refinement.	MOTIVATION: In the past decade, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a pivotal method for transcriptomic profiling in biomedical research. Precise cell-type identification is crucial for subsequent analysis of single-cell data. And the integration and refinement of annotated data are essential for building comprehensive databases. However, prevailing annotation techniques often overlook the hierarchical organization of cell types, resulting in inconsistent annotations. Meanwhile, most existing integration approaches fail to integrate datasets with different annotation depths and none of them can enhance the labels of outdated data with lower annotation resolutions using more intricately annotated datasets or novel biological findings. RESULTS: Here, we introduce scPLAN, a hierarchical computational framework designed for scRNA-seq data analysis. scPLAN excels in annotating unlabeled scRNA-seq data using a reference dataset structured along a hierarchical cell-type tree. It identifies potential novel cell types in a systematic, layer-by-layer manner. Additionally, scPLAN effectively integrates annotated scRNA-seq datasets with varying levels of annotation depth, ensuring consistent refinement of cell-type labels across datasets with lower resolutions. Through extensive annotation and novel cell detection experiments, scPLAN has demonstrated its efficacy. Two case studies have been conducted to showcase how scPLAN integrates datasets with diverse cell-type label resolutions and refine their cell-type labels.

37697162	2023	Nature methods	Recovery of missing single-cell RNA-sequencing data with optimized transcriptomic references.	Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is an indispensable tool for characterizing cellular diversity and generating hypotheses throughout biology. Droplet-based scRNA-seq datasets often lack expression data for genes that can be detected with other methods. Here we show that the observed sensitivity deficits stem from three sources: (1) poor annotation of 3' gene ends; (2) issues with intronic read incorporation; and (3) gene overlap-derived read loss. We show that missing gene expression data can be recovered by optimizing the reference transcriptome for scRNA-seq through recovering false intergenic reads, implementing a hybrid pre-mRNA mapping strategy and resolving gene overlaps. We demonstrate, with a diverse collection of mouse and human tissue data, that reference optimization can substantially improve cellular profiling resolution and reveal missing cell types and marker genes. Our findings argue that transcriptomic references need to be optimized for scRNA-seq analysis and warrant a reanalysis of previously published datasets and cell atlases.
35298589	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	A Bayesian method to cluster single-cell RNA sequencing data using copy number alterations.	MOTIVATION: Cancers are composed by several heterogeneous subpopulations, each one harbouring different genetic and epigenetic somatic alterations that contribute to disease onset and therapy response. In recent years, copy number alterations (CNAs) leading to tumour aneuploidy have been identified as potential key drivers of such populations, but the definition of the precise makeup of cancer subclones from sequencing assays remains challenging. In the end, little is known about the mapping between complex CNAs and their effect on cancer phenotypes. RESULTS: We introduce CONGAS, a Bayesian probabilistic method to phase bulk DNA and single-cell RNA measurements from independent assays. CONGAS jointly identifies clusters of single cells with subclonal CNAs, and differences in RNA expression. The model builds statistical priors leveraging bulk DNA sequencing data, does not require a normal reference and scales fast thanks to a GPU backend and variational inference. We test CONGAS on both simulated and real data, and find that it can determine the tumour subclonal composition at the single-cell level together with clone-specific RNA phenotypes in tumour data generated from both 10x and Smart-Seq assays. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: CONGAS is available as 2 packages: CONGAS (https://github.com/caravagnalab/congas), which implements the model in Python, and RCONGAS (https://caravagnalab.github.io/rcongas/), which provides R functions to process inputs, outputs and run CONGAS fits. The analysis of real data and scripts to generate figures of this paper are available via RCONGAS; code associated to simulations is available at https://github.com/caravagnalab/rcongas_test. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
29030469	2017	Genome research	Single-cell gene expression analysis reveals regulators of distinct cell subpopulations among developing human neurons.	The stochastic dynamics and regulatory mechanisms that govern differentiation of individual human neural precursor cells (NPC) into mature neurons are currently not fully understood. Here, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of developing neurons to dissect/identify NPC subtypes and critical developmental stages of alternative lineage specifications. This study comprises an unsupervised, high-resolution strategy for identifying cell developmental bifurcations, tracking the stochastic transcript kinetics of the subpopulations, elucidating regulatory networks, and finding key regulators. Our data revealed the bifurcation and developmental tracks of the two NPC subpopulations, and we captured an early (24 h) transition phase that leads to alternative neuronal specifications. The consequent up-regulation and down-regulation of stage- and subpopulation-specific gene groups during the course of maturation revealed biological insights with regard to key regulatory transcription factors and lincRNAs that control cellular programs in the identified neuronal subpopulations.
33471060	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Cellinker: a platform of ligand-receptor interactions for intercellular communication analysis.	MOTIVATION: Ligand-receptor (L-R) interactions mediate cell adhesion, recognition and communication and play essential roles in physiological and pathological signaling. With the rapid development of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies, systematically decoding the intercellular communication network involving L-R interactions has become a focus of research. Therefore, construction of a comprehensive, high-confidence and well-organized resource to retrieve L-R interactions in order to study the functional effects of cell-cell communications would be of great value. RESULTS: In this study, we developed Cellinker, a manually curated resource of literature-supported L-R interactions that play roles in cell-cell communication. We aimed to provide a useful platform for studies on cell-cell communication mediated by L-R interactions. The current version of Cellinker documents over 3,700 human and 3,200 mouse L-R protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and embeds a practical and convenient webserver with which researchers can decode intercellular communications based on scRNA-seq data. And over 400 endogenous small molecule (sMOL) related L-R interactions were collected as well. Moreover, to help with research on coronavirus (CoV) infection, Cellinker collects information on 16 L-R PPIs involved in CoV-human interactions (including 12 L-R PPIs involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection). In summary, Cellinker provides a user-friendly interface for querying, browsing and visualizing L-R interactions as well as a practical and convenient web tool for inferring intercellular communications based on scRNA-seq data. We believe this platform could promote intercellular communication research and accelerate the development of related algorithms for scRNA-seq studies. AVAILABILITY: Cellinker is available at http://www.rna-society.org/cellinker/. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
29478411	2018	Genome biology	Observation weights unlock bulk RNA-seq tools for zero inflation and single-cell applications.	Dropout events in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) cause many transcripts to go undetected and induce an excess of zero read counts, leading to power issues in differential expression (DE) analysis. This has triggered the development of bespoke scRNA-seq DE methods to cope with zero inflation. Recent evaluations, however, have shown that dedicated scRNA-seq tools provide no advantage compared to traditional bulk RNA-seq tools. We introduce a weighting strategy, based on a zero-inflated negative binomial model, that identifies excess zero counts and generates gene- and cell-specific weights to unlock bulk RNA-seq DE pipelines for zero-inflated data, boosting performance for scRNA-seq.

31359028	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	ACTINN: automated identification of cell types in single cell RNA sequencing.	MOTIVATION: Cell type identification is one of the major goals in single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Current methods for assigning cell types typically involve the use of unsupervised clustering, the identification of signature genes in each cluster, followed by a manual lookup of these genes in the literature and databases to assign cell types. However, there are several limitations associated with these approaches, such as unwanted sources of variation that influence clustering and a lack of canonical markers for certain cell types. Here, we present ACTINN (Automated Cell Type Identification using Neural Networks), which employs a neural network with three hidden layers, trains on datasets with predefined cell types and predicts cell types for other datasets based on the trained parameters. RESULTS: We trained the neural network on a mouse cell type atlas (Tabula Muris Atlas) and a human immune cell dataset, and used it to predict cell types for mouse leukocytes, human PBMCs and human T cell sub types. The results showed that our neural network is fast and accurate, and should therefore be a useful tool to complement existing scRNA-seq pipelines. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The codes and datasets are available at https://figshare.com/articles/ACTINN/8967116. Tutorial is available at https://github.com/mafeiyang/ACTINN. All codes are implemented in python. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
38950180	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	SFINN: inferring gene regulatory network from single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data with shared factor neighborhood and integrated neural network.	MOTIVATION: The rise of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology presents new opportunities for constructing detailed cell type-specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs) to study cell heterogeneity. However, challenges caused by noises, technical errors, and dropout phenomena in scRNA-seq data pose significant obstacles to GRN inference, making the design of accurate GRN inference algorithms still essential. The recent growth of both single-cell and spatial transcriptomic sequencing data enables the development of supervised deep learning methods to infer GRNs on these diverse single-cell datasets. RESULTS: In this study, we introduce a novel deep learning framework based on shared factor neighborhood and integrated neural network (SFINN) for inferring potential interactions and causalities between transcription factors and target genes from single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data. SFINN utilizes shared factor neighborhood to construct cellular neighborhood network based on gene expression data and additionally integrates cellular network generated from spatial location information. Subsequently, the cell adjacency matrix and gene pair expression are fed into an integrated neural network framework consisting of a graph convolutional neural network and a fully-connected neural network to determine whether the genes interact. Performance evaluation in the tasks of gene interaction and causality prediction against the existing GRN reconstruction algorithms demonstrates the usability and competitiveness of SFINN across different kinds of data. SFINN can be applied to infer GRNs from conventional single-cell sequencing data and spatial transcriptomic data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: SFINN can be accessed at GitHub: https://github.com/JGuan-lab/SFINN.
35880426	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	Benchmarking methods for detecting differential states between conditions from multi-subject single-cell RNA-seq data.	Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables researchers to quantify transcriptomes of thousands of cells simultaneously and study transcriptomic changes between cells. scRNA-seq datasets increasingly include multisubject, multicondition experiments to investigate cell-type-specific differential states (DS) between conditions. This can be performed by first identifying the cell types in all the subjects and then by performing a DS analysis between the conditions within each cell type. Naive single-cell DS analysis methods that treat cells statistically independent are subject to false positives in the presence of variation between biological replicates, an issue known as the pseudoreplicate bias. While several methods have already been introduced to carry out the statistical testing in multisubject scRNA-seq analysis, comparisons that include all these methods are currently lacking. Here, we performed a comprehensive comparison of 18 methods for the identification of DS changes between conditions from multisubject scRNA-seq data. Our results suggest that the pseudobulk methods performed generally best. Both pseudobulks and mixed models that model the subjects as a random effect were superior compared with the naive single-cell methods that do not model the subjects in any way. While the naive models achieved higher sensitivity than the pseudobulk methods and the mixed models, they were subject to a high number of false positives. In addition, accounting for subjects through latent variable modeling did not improve the performance of the naive methods.
41267124	2025	Genome biology	scSpecies: enhancement of network architecture alignment in comparative single-cell studies.	Animals can provide meaningful context for human single-cell data. To transfer information between species, we propose a deep learning approach that pre-trains a conditional variational autoencoder on animal data and transfers its final encoder layers to a human network architecture. Our approach then aligns latent spaces by leveraging data-level and model-learned similarities. We utilize this for label transfer and differential gene expression analysis in cross-species pairs of liver, adipose tissue, and glioblastoma datasets. Our results are robust even when gene sets differ, or datasets are small. Thus, we reliably exploit similarities between species to provide context for human single-cell data.
27486082	2016	Genome research	Single-cell analyses of X Chromosome inactivation dynamics and pluripotency during differentiation.	"Pluripotency, differentiation, and X Chromosome inactivation (XCI) are key aspects of embryonic development. However, the underlying relationship and mechanisms among these processes remain unclear. Here, we systematically dissected these features along developmental progression using mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and single-cell RNA sequencing with allelic resolution. We found that mESCs grown in a ground state 2i condition displayed transcriptomic profiles diffused from preimplantation mouse embryonic cells, whereas EpiStem cells closely resembled the post-implantation epiblast. Sex-related gene expression varied greatly across distinct developmental states. We also identified novel markers that were highly enriched in each developmental state. Moreover, we revealed that several novel pathways, including PluriNetWork and Focal Adhesion, were responsible for the delayed progression of female EpiStem cells. Importantly, we ""digitalized"" XCI progression using allelic expression of active and inactive X Chromosomes and surprisingly found that XCI states exhibited profound variability in each developmental state, including the 2i condition. XCI progression was not tightly synchronized with loss of pluripotency and increase of differentiation at the single-cell level, although these processes were globally correlated. In addition, highly expressed genes, including core pluripotency factors, were in general biallelically expressed. Taken together, our study sheds light on the dynamics of XCI progression and the asynchronicity between pluripotency, differentiation, and XCI."
37864293	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	NG-SEM: an effective non-Gaussian structural equation modeling framework for gene regulatory network inference from single-cell RNA-seq data.	Inference of gene regulatory network (GRN) from gene expression profiles has been a central problem in systems biology and bioinformatics in the past decades. The tremendous emergency of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data brings new opportunities and challenges for GRN inference: the extensive dropouts and complicated noise structure may also degrade the performance of contemporary gene regulatory models. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop more accurate methods for gene regulatory network inference in single-cell data while considering the noise structure at the same time. In this paper, we extend the traditional structural equation modeling (SEM) framework by considering a flexible noise modeling strategy, namely we use the Gaussian mixtures to approximate the complex stochastic nature of a biological system, since the Gaussian mixture framework can be arguably served as a universal approximation for any continuous distributions. The proposed non-Gaussian SEM framework is called NG-SEM, which can be optimized by iteratively performing Expectation-Maximization algorithm and weighted least-squares method. Moreover, the Akaike Information Criteria is adopted to select the number of components of the Gaussian mixture. To probe the accuracy and stability of our proposed method, we design a comprehensive variate of control experiments to systematically investigate the performance of NG-SEM under various conditions, including simulations and real biological data sets. Results on synthetic data demonstrate that this strategy can improve the performance of traditional Gaussian SEM model and results on real biological data sets verify that NG-SEM outperforms other five state-of-the-art methods.
38493338	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Effective multi-modal clustering method via skip aggregation network for parallel scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data.	In recent years, there has been a growing trend in the realm of parallel clustering analysis for single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA) and single-cell Assay of Transposase Accessible Chromatin (scATAC) data. However, prevailing methods often treat these two data modalities as equals, neglecting the fact that the scRNA mode holds significantly richer information compared to the scATAC. This disregard hinders the model benefits from the insights derived from multiple modalities, compromising the overall clustering performance. To this end, we propose an effective multi-modal clustering model scEMC for parallel scRNA and Assay of Transposase Accessible Chromatin data. Concretely, we have devised a skip aggregation network to simultaneously learn global structural information among cells and integrate data from diverse modalities. To safeguard the quality of integrated cell representation against the influence stemming from sparse scATAC data, we connect the scRNA data with the aggregated representation via skip connection. Moreover, to effectively fit the real distribution of cells, we introduced a Zero Inflated Negative Binomial-based denoising autoencoder that accommodates corrupted data containing synthetic noise, concurrently integrating a joint optimization module that employs multiple losses. Extensive experiments serve to underscore the effectiveness of our model. This work contributes significantly to the ongoing exploration of cell subpopulations and tumor microenvironments, and the code of our work will be public at https://github.com/DayuHuu/scEMC.
30779739	2019	PLoS computational biology	A component overlapping attribute clustering (COAC) algorithm for single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis and potential pathobiological implications.	Recent advances in next-generation sequencing and computational technologies have enabled routine analysis of large-scale single-cell ribonucleic acid sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. However, scRNA-seq technologies have suffered from several technical challenges, including low mean expression levels in most genes and higher frequencies of missing data than bulk population sequencing technologies. Identifying functional gene sets and their regulatory networks that link specific cell types to human diseases and therapeutics from scRNA-seq profiles are daunting tasks. In this study, we developed a Component Overlapping Attribute Clustering (COAC) algorithm to perform the localized (cell subpopulation) gene co-expression network analysis from large-scale scRNA-seq profiles. Gene subnetworks that represent specific gene co-expression patterns are inferred from the components of a decomposed matrix of scRNA-seq profiles. We showed that single-cell gene subnetworks identified by COAC from multiple time points within cell phases can be used for cell type identification with high accuracy (83%). In addition, COAC-inferred subnetworks from melanoma patients' scRNA-seq profiles are highly correlated with survival rate from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Moreover, the localized gene subnetworks identified by COAC from individual patients' scRNA-seq data can be used as pharmacogenomics biomarkers to predict drug responses (The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves ranges from 0.728 to 0.783) in cancer cell lines from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database. In summary, COAC offers a powerful tool to identify potential network-based diagnostic and pharmacogenomics biomarkers from large-scale scRNA-seq profiles. COAC is freely available at https://github.com/ChengF-Lab/COAC.
31777938	2020	Nucleic acids research	SAME-clustering: Single-cell Aggregated Clustering via Mixture Model Ensemble.	Clustering is an essential step in the analysis of single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data to shed light on tissue complexity including the number of cell types and transcriptomic signatures of each cell type. Due to its importance, novel methods have been developed recently for this purpose. However, different approaches generate varying estimates regarding the number of clusters and the single-cell level cluster assignments. This type of unsupervised clustering is challenging and it is often times hard to gauge which method to use because none of the existing methods outperform others across all scenarios. We present SAME-clustering, a mixture model-based approach that takes clustering solutions from multiple methods and selects a maximally diverse subset to produce an improved ensemble solution. We tested SAME-clustering across 15 scRNA-seq datasets generated by different platforms, with number of clusters varying from 3 to 15, and number of single cells from 49 to 32 695. Results show that our SAME-clustering ensemble method yields enhanced clustering, in terms of both cluster assignments and number of clusters. The mixture model ensemble clustering is not limited to clustering scRNA-seq data and may be useful to a wide range of clustering applications.
38388681	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Continually adapting pre-trained language model to universal annotation of single-cell RNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: Cell-type annotation of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data is a hallmark of biomedical research and clinical application. Current annotation tools usually assume the simultaneous acquisition of well-annotated data, but without the ability to expand knowledge from new data. Yet, such tools are inconsistent with the continuous emergence of scRNA-seq data, calling for a continuous cell-type annotation model. In addition, by their powerful ability of information integration and model interpretability, transformer-based pre-trained language models have led to breakthroughs in single-cell biology research. Therefore, the systematic combining of continual learning and pre-trained language models for cell-type annotation tasks is inevitable. RESULTS: We herein propose a universal cell-type annotation tool, called CANAL, that continuously fine-tunes a pre-trained language model trained on a large amount of unlabeled scRNA-seq data, as new well-labeled data emerges. CANAL essentially alleviates the dilemma of catastrophic forgetting, both in terms of model inputs and outputs. For model inputs, we introduce an experience replay schema that repeatedly reviews previous vital examples in current training stages. This is achieved through a dynamic example bank with a fixed buffer size. The example bank is class-balanced and proficient in retaining cell-type-specific information, particularly facilitating the consolidation of patterns associated with rare cell types. For model outputs, we utilize representation knowledge distillation to regularize the divergence between previous and current models, resulting in the preservation of knowledge learned from past training stages. Moreover, our universal annotation framework considers the inclusion of new cell types throughout the fine-tuning and testing stages. We can continuously expand the cell-type annotation library by absorbing new cell types from newly arrived, well-annotated training datasets, as well as automatically identify novel cells in unlabeled datasets. Comprehensive experiments with data streams under various biological scenarios demonstrate the versatility and high model interpretability of CANAL. AVAILABILITY: An implementation of CANAL is available from https://github.com/aster-ww/CANAL-torch. CONTACT: dengmh@pku.edu.cn. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Journal Name online.
39380041	2024	Genome biology	Visualizing scRNA-Seq data at population scale with GloScope.	Increasingly, scRNA-Seq studies explore cell populations across different samples and the effect of sample heterogeneity on organism's phenotype. However, relatively few bioinformatic methods have been developed which adequately address the variation between samples for such population-level analyses. We propose a framework for representing the entire single-cell profile of a sample, which we call a GloScope representation. We implement GloScope on scRNA-Seq datasets from study designs ranging from 12 to over 300 samples and demonstrate how GloScope allows researchers to perform essential bioinformatic tasks at the sample-level, in particular visualization and quality control assessment.
38940130	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Forseti: a mechanistic and predictive model of the splicing status of scRNA-seq reads.	MOTIVATION: Short-read single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been used to study cellular heterogeneity, cellular fate, and transcriptional dynamics. Modeling splicing dynamics in scRNA-seq data is challenging, with inherent difficulty in even the seemingly straightforward task of elucidating the splicing status of the molecules from which sequenced fragments are drawn. This difficulty arises, in part, from the limited read length and positional biases, which substantially reduce the specificity of the sequenced fragments. As a result, the splicing status of many reads in scRNA-seq is ambiguous because of a lack of definitive evidence. We are therefore in need of methods that can recover the splicing status of ambiguous reads which, in turn, can lead to more accuracy and confidence in downstream analyses. RESULTS: We develop Forseti, a predictive model to probabilistically assign a splicing status to scRNA-seq reads. Our model has two key components. First, we train a binding affinity model to assign a probability that a given transcriptomic site is used in fragment generation. Second, we fit a robust fragment length distribution model that generalizes well across datasets deriving from different species and tissue types. Forseti combines these two trained models to predict the splicing status of the molecule of origin of reads by scoring putative fragments that associate each alignment of sequenced reads with proximate potential priming sites. Using both simulated and experimental data, we show that our model can precisely predict the splicing status of many reads and identify the true gene origin of multi-gene mapped reads. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Forseti and the code used for producing the results are available at https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/forseti under a BSD 3-clause license.
35443717	2022	Genome biology	One Cell At a Time (OCAT): a unified framework to integrate and analyze single-cell RNA-seq data.	Integrative analysis of large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets can aggregate complementary biological information from different datasets. However, most existing methods fail to efficiently integrate multiple large-scale scRNA-seq datasets. We propose OCAT, One Cell At a Time, a machine learning method that sparsely encodes single-cell gene expression to integrate data from multiple sources without highly variable gene selection or explicit batch effect correction. We demonstrate that OCAT efficiently integrates multiple scRNA-seq datasets and achieves the state-of-the-art performance in cell type clustering, especially in challenging scenarios of non-overlapping cell types. In addition, OCAT can efficaciously facilitate a variety of downstream analyses.
29718338	2018	Nucleic acids research	BCseq: accurate single cell RNA-seq quantification with bias correction.	With rapid technical advances, single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) has been used to detect cell subtypes exhibiting distinct gene expression profiles and to trace cell transitions in development and disease. However, the potential of scRNA-seq for new discoveries is constrained by the robustness of subsequent data analysis. Here we propose a robust model, BCseq (bias-corrected sequencing analysis), to accurately quantify gene expression from scRNA-seq. BCseq corrects inherent bias of scRNA-seq in a data-adaptive manner and effectively removes technical noise. BCseq rescues dropouts through weighted consideration of similar cells. Cells with higher sequencing depths contribute more to the quantification nonlinearly. Furthermore, BCseq assigns a quality score for the expression of each gene in each cell, providing users an objective measure to select genes for downstream analysis. In comparison to existing scRNA-seq methods, BCseq demonstrates increased robustness in detection of differentially expressed (DE) genes and cell subtype classification.
35172874	2022	Genome biology	Comparative analysis of antibody- and lipid-based multiplexing methods for single-cell RNA-seq.	"BACKGROUND: Multiplexing of samples in single-cell RNA-seq studies allows a significant reduction of the experimental costs, straightforward identification of doublets, increased cell throughput, and reduction of sample-specific batch effects. Recently published multiplexing techniques using oligo-conjugated antibodies or -lipids allow barcoding sample-specific cells, a process called ""hashing."" RESULTS: Here, we compare the hashing performance of TotalSeq-A and -C antibodies, custom synthesized lipids and MULTI-seq lipid hashes in four cell lines, both for single-cell RNA-seq and single-nucleus RNA-seq. We also compare TotalSeq-B antibodies with CellPlex reagents (10x Genomics) on human PBMCs and TotalSeq-B with different lipids on primary mouse tissues. Hashing efficiency was evaluated using the intrinsic genetic variation of the cell lines and mouse strains. Antibody hashing was further evaluated on clinical samples using PBMCs from healthy and SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, where we demonstrate a more affordable approach for large single-cell sequencing clinical studies, while simultaneously reducing batch effects. CONCLUSIONS: Benchmarking of different hashing strategies and computational pipelines indicates that correct demultiplexing can be achieved with both lipid- and antibody-hashed human cells and nuclei, with MULTISeqDemux as the preferred demultiplexing function and antibody-based hashing as the most efficient protocol on cells. On nuclei datasets, lipid hashing delivers the best results. Lipid hashing also outperforms antibodies on cells isolated from mouse brain. However, antibodies demonstrate better results on tissues like spleen or lung."
35639771	2022	Nucleic acids research	PCGA: a comprehensive web server for phenotype-cell-gene association analysis.	Most complex disease-associated loci mapped by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are located in non-coding regions. It remains elusive which genes the associated loci regulate and in which tissues/cell types the regulation occurs. Here, we present PCGA (https://pmglab.top/pcga), a comprehensive web server for jointly estimating both associated tissues/cell types and susceptibility genes for complex phenotypes by GWAS summary statistics. The web server is built on our published method, DESE, which represents an effective method to mutually estimate driver tissues and genes by integrating GWAS summary statistics and transcriptome data. By collecting and processing extensive bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, PCGA has included expression profiles of 54 human tissues, 2,214 human cell types and 4,384 mouse cell types, which provide the basis for estimating associated tissues/cell types and genes for complex phenotypes. We develop a framework to sequentially estimate associated tissues and cell types of a complex phenotype according to their hierarchical relationships we curated. Meanwhile, we construct a phenotype-cell-gene association landscape by estimating the associated tissues/cell types and genes of 1,871 public GWASs. The association landscape is generally consistent with biological knowledge and can be searched and browsed at the PCGA website.
38514799	2025	Nature biotechnology	Starfysh integrates spatial transcriptomic and histologic data to reveal heterogeneous tumor-immune hubs.	Spatially resolved gene expression profiling provides insight into tissue organization and cell-cell crosstalk; however, sequencing-based spatial transcriptomics (ST) lacks single-cell resolution. Current ST analysis methods require single-cell RNA sequencing data as a reference for rigorous interpretation of cell states, mostly do not use associated histology images and are not capable of inferring shared neighborhoods across multiple tissues. Here we present Starfysh, a computational toolbox using a deep generative model that incorporates archetypal analysis and any known cell type markers to characterize known or new tissue-specific cell states without a single-cell reference. Starfysh improves the characterization of spatial dynamics in complex tissues using histology images and enables the comparison of niches as spatial hubs across tissues. Integrative analysis of primary estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and metaplastic breast cancer (MBC) tissues led to the identification of spatial hubs with patient- and disease-specific cell type compositions and revealed metabolic reprogramming shaping immunosuppressive hubs in aggressive MBC.
41224531	2025	Genome research	Label-free selection of marker genes in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics with geneCover.	The selection of marker gene panels is critical for capturing the cellular and spatial heterogeneity in the expanding atlases of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics data. Most current approaches to marker gene selection operate in a label-based framework, which is inherently limited by its dependency on predefined cell type labels or clustering results. In contrast, existing label-free methods often struggle to identify genes that characterize rare cell types or subtle spatial patterns, and they frequently fail to scale efficiently with large data sets. Here, we introduce geneCover, a label-free combinatorial method that selects an optimal panel of minimally redundant marker genes based on gene-gene correlations. Our method demonstrates excellent scalability to large data sets and identifies marker gene panels that capture distinct correlation structures across the transcriptome. This allows geneCover to distinguish cell states in various tissues of living organisms effectively, including those associated with rare or otherwise difficult-to-identify cell types. We evaluate the performance of geneCover across various scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data sets, comparing it to other label-free algorithms to highlight its utility and potential in diverse biological contexts.
36209413	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	PPMS: A framework to Profile Primary MicroRNAs from Single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell/nuclei RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies can simultaneously quantify gene expression in thousands of cells across the genome. However, the majority of the noncoding RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), cannot currently be profiled at the same scale. MiRNAs are a class of small noncoding RNAs and play an important role in gene regulation. MiRNAs originate from the processing of primary transcripts, known as primary-microRNAs (pri-miRNAs). The pri-miRNA transcripts, independent of their cognate miRNAs, can also function as long noncoding RNAs, code for micropeptides or even interact with DNA, acting like enhancers. Therefore, it is apparent that the significance of scRNA-seq pri-miRNA profiling expands beyond using pri-miRNA as proxies of mature miRNAs. However, there are no computational methods that allow profiling and quantification of pri-miRNAs at the single-cell-type resolution. RESULTS: We have developed a simple yet effective computational framework to profile pri-MiRNAs from single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets (PPMS). Based on user input, PPMS can profile pri-miRNAs at cell-type resolution. PPMS can be applied to both newly produced and publicly available datasets obtained via single cell or single-nuclei RNA-seq. It allows users to (i) investigate the distribution of pri-miRNAs across cell types and cell states and (ii) establish a relationship between the number of cells/reads sequenced and the detection of pri-miRNAs. Here, to demonstrate its efficacy, we have applied PPMS to publicly available scRNA-seq data generated from (i) individual chambers (ventricles and atria) of the human heart, (ii) human pluripotent stem cells during their differentiation into cardiomyocytes (the heart beating cells) and (iii) hiPSCs-derived cardiomyocytes infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.
36205615	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scHiCPTR: unsupervised pseudotime inference through dual graph refinement for single-cell Hi-C data.	MOTIVATION: The emerging single-cell Hi-C technology provides opportunities to study dynamics of chromosomal organization. How to construct a pseudotime path using single-cell Hi-C contact matrices to order cells along developmental trajectory is a challenging topic, since these matrices produced by the technology are inherently high dimensional and sparse, they suffer from noises and biases, and the topology of trajectory underlying them may be diverse. RESULTS: We present scHiCPTR, an unsupervised graph-based pipeline to infer pseudotime from single-cell Hi-C contact matrices. It provides a workflow consisting of imputation and embedding, graph construction, dual graph refinement, pseudotime calculation and result visualization. Beyond the few existing methods, scHiCPTR ties to optimize graph structure by two parallel procedures of graph pruning, which help reduce the spurious cell links resulted from noises and determine a global developmental directionality. Besides, it has an ability to handle developmental trajectories with multiple topologies, including linear, bifurcated and circular ones, and is competitive with methods developed for single-cell RNA-seq data. The comparative results tell that our scHiCPTR can achieve higher performance in pseudotime inference, and the inferred developmental trajectory exhibit a reasonable biological significance. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: scHiCPTR is freely available at https://github.com/lhqxinghun/scHiCPTR. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
35302164	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	Learning deep features and topological structure of cells for clustering of scRNA-sequencing data.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) measures gene transcriptome at the cell level, paving the way for the identification of cell subpopulations. Although deep learning has been successfully applied to scRNA-seq data, these algorithms are criticized for the undesirable performance and interpretability of patterns because of the noises, high-dimensionality and extraordinary sparsity of scRNA-seq data. To address these issues, a novel deep learning subspace clustering algorithm (aka scGDC) for cell types in scRNA-seq data is proposed, which simultaneously learns the deep features and topological structure of cells. Specifically, scGDC extends auto-encoder by introducing a self-representation layer to extract deep features of cells, and learns affinity graph of cells, which provide a better and more comprehensive strategy to characterize structure of cell types. To address heterogeneity of scRNA-seq data, scGDC projects cells of various types onto different subspaces, where types, particularly rare cell types, are well discriminated by utilizing generative adversarial learning. Furthermore, scGDC joins deep feature extraction, structural learning and cell type discovery, where features of cells are extracted under the guidance of cell types, thereby improving performance of algorithms. A total of 15 scRNA-seq datasets from various tissues and organisms with the number of cells ranging from 56 to 63 103 are adopted to validate performance of algorithms, and experimental results demonstrate that scGDC significantly outperforms 14 state-of-the-art methods in terms of various measurements (on average 25.51% by improvement), where (rare) cell types are significantly associated with topology of affinity graph of cells. The proposed model and algorithm provide an effective strategy for the analysis of scRNA-seq data (The software is coded using python, and is freely available for academic https://github.com/xkmaxidian/scGDC).
36744437	2023	Nucleic acids research	LINE-1 retrotransposon expression in cancerous, epithelial and neuronal cells revealed by 5' single-cell RNA-Seq.	LINE-1 retrotransposons are sequences capable of copying themselves to new genomic loci via an RNA intermediate. New studies implicate LINE-1 in a range of diseases, especially in the context of aging, but without an accurate understanding of where and when LINE-1 is expressed, a full accounting of its role in health and disease is not possible. We therefore developed a method-5' scL1seq-that makes use of a widely available library preparation method (10x Genomics 5' single cell RNA-seq) to measure LINE-1 expression in tens of thousands of single cells. We recapitulated the known pattern of LINE-1 expression in tumors-present in cancer cells, absent from immune cells-and identified hitherto undescribed LINE-1 expression in human epithelial cells and mouse hippocampal neurons. In both cases, we saw a modest increase with age, supporting recent research connecting LINE-1 to age related diseases.
37740953	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	DeepCCI: a deep learning framework for identifying cell-cell interactions from single-cell RNA sequencing data.	MOTIVATION: Cell-cell interactions (CCIs) play critical roles in many biological processes such as cellular differentiation, tissue homeostasis, and immune response. With the rapid development of high throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies, it is of high importance to identify CCIs from the ever-increasing scRNA-seq data. However, limited by the algorithmic constraints, current computational methods based on statistical strategies ignore some key latent information contained in scRNA-seq data with high sparsity and heterogeneity. RESULTS: Here, we developed a deep learning framework named DeepCCI to identify meaningful CCIs from scRNA-seq data. Applications of DeepCCI to a wide range of publicly available datasets from diverse technologies and platforms demonstrate its ability to predict significant CCIs accurately and effectively. Powered by the flexible and easy-to-use software, DeepCCI can provide the one-stop solution to discover meaningful intercellular interactions and build CCI networks from scRNA-seq data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code of DeepCCI is available online at https://github.com/JiangBioLab/DeepCCI.
33974010	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	MAT2: manifold alignment of single-cell transcriptomes with cell triplets.	MOTIVATION: Aligning single-cell transcriptomes is important for the joint analysis of multiple single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, which in turn is vital to establishing a holistic cellular landscape of certain biological processes. Although numbers of approaches have been proposed for this problem, most of which only consider mutual neighbors when aligning the cells without taking into account known cell type annotations. RESULTS: In this work, we present MAT2 that aligns cells in the manifold space with a deep neural network employing contrastive learning strategy. Compared with other manifold-based approaches, MAT2 has two-fold advantages. Firstly, with cell triplets defined based on known cell type annotations, the consensus manifold yielded by the alignment procedure is more robust especially for datasets with limited common cell types. Secondly, the batch-effect-free gene expression reconstructed by MAT2 can better help annotate cell types. Benchmarking results on real scRNA-seq datasets demonstrate that MAT2 outperforms existing popular methods. Moreover, with MAT2, the hematopoietic stem cells are found to differentiate at different paces between human and mouse. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: MAT2 is publicly available at https://github.com/Zhang-Jinglong/MAT2. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
32746932	2020	Genome biology	Knowledge-primed neural networks enable biologically interpretable deep learning on single-cell sequencing data.	BACKGROUND: Deep learning has emerged as a versatile approach for predicting complex biological phenomena. However, its utility for biological discovery has so far been limited, given that generic deep neural networks provide little insight into the biological mechanisms that underlie a successful prediction. Here we demonstrate deep learning on biological networks, where every node has a molecular equivalent, such as a protein or gene, and every edge has a mechanistic interpretation, such as a regulatory interaction along a signaling pathway. RESULTS: With knowledge-primed neural networks (KPNNs), we exploit the ability of deep learning algorithms to assign meaningful weights in multi-layered networks, resulting in a widely applicable approach for interpretable deep learning. We present a learning method that enhances the interpretability of trained KPNNs by stabilizing node weights in the presence of redundancy, enhancing the quantitative interpretability of node weights, and controlling for uneven connectivity in biological networks. We validate KPNNs on simulated data with known ground truth and demonstrate their practical use and utility in five biological applications with single-cell RNA-seq data for cancer and immune cells. CONCLUSIONS: We introduce KPNNs as a method that combines the predictive power of deep learning with the interpretability of biological networks. While demonstrated here on single-cell sequencing data, this method is broadly relevant to other research areas where prior domain knowledge can be represented as networks.
28446220	2017	Genome biology	SCALE: modeling allele-specific gene expression by single-cell RNA sequencing.	Allele-specific expression is traditionally studied by bulk RNA sequencing, which measures average expression across cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing allows the comparison of expression distribution between the two alleles of a diploid organism and the characterization of allele-specific bursting. Here, we propose SCALE to analyze genome-wide allele-specific bursting, with adjustment of technical variability. SCALE detects genes exhibiting allelic differences in bursting parameters and genes whose alleles burst non-independently. We apply SCALE to mouse blastocyst and human fibroblast cells and find that cis control in gene expression overwhelmingly manifests as differences in burst frequency.
38308274	2024	Genome biology	Mapping the functional impact of non-coding regulatory elements in primary T cells through single-cell CRISPR screens.	"BACKGROUND: Drug targets with genetic evidence are expected to increase clinical success by at least twofold. Yet, translating disease-associated genetic variants into functional knowledge remains a fundamental challenge of drug discovery. A key issue is that the vast majority of complex disease associations cannot be cleanly mapped to a gene. Immune disease-associated variants are enriched within regulatory elements found in T-cell-specific open chromatin regions. RESULTS: To identify genes and molecular programs modulated by these regulatory elements, we develop a CRISPRi-based single-cell functional screening approach in primary human T cells. Our pipeline enables the interrogation of transcriptomic changes induced by the perturbation of regulatory elements at scale. We first optimize an efficient CRISPRi protocol in primary CD4(+) T cells via CROPseq vectors. Subsequently, we perform a screen targeting 45 non-coding regulatory elements and 35 transcription start sites and profile approximately 250,000 T -cell single-cell transcriptomes. We develop a bespoke analytical pipeline for element-to-gene (E2G) mapping and demonstrate that our method can identify both previously annotated and novel E2G links. Lastly, we integrate genetic association data for immune-related traits and demonstrate how our platform can aid in the identification of effector genes for GWAS loci. CONCLUSIONS: We describe ""primary T cell crisprQTL"" - a scalable, single-cell functional genomics approach for mapping regulatory elements to genes in primary human T cells. We show how this framework can facilitate the interrogation of immune disease GWAS hits and propose that the combination of experimental and QTL-based techniques is likely to address the variant-to-function problem."
34581807	2021	Nucleic acids research	MLG: multilayer graph clustering for multi-condition scRNA-seq data.	Single-cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-seq) enabled investigations of cellular heterogeneity at exceedingly higher resolutions. Identification of novel cell types or transient developmental stages across multiple experimental conditions is one of its key applications. Linear and non-linear dimensionality reduction for data integration became a foundational tool in inference from scRNA-seq data. We present multilayer graph clustering (MLG) as an integrative approach for combining multiple dimensionality reduction of multi-condition scRNA-seq data. MLG generates a multilayer shared nearest neighbor cell graph with higher signal-to-noise ratio and outperforms current best practices in terms of clustering accuracy across large-scale benchmarking experiments. Application of MLG to a wide variety of datasets from multiple conditions highlights how MLG boosts signal-to-noise ratio for fine-grained sub-population identification. MLG is widely applicable to settings with single cell data integration via dimension reduction.
33179754	2021	Nucleic acids research	TISCH: a comprehensive web resource enabling interactive single-cell transcriptome visualization of tumor microenvironment.	Cancer immunotherapy targeting co-inhibitory pathways by checkpoint blockade shows remarkable efficacy in a variety of cancer types. However, only a minority of patients respond to treatment due to the stochastic heterogeneity of tumor microenvironment (TME). Recent advances in single-cell RNA-seq technologies enabled comprehensive characterization of the immune system heterogeneity in tumors but posed computational challenges on integrating and utilizing the massive published datasets to inform immunotherapy. Here, we present Tumor Immune Single Cell Hub (TISCH, http://tisch.comp-genomics.org), a large-scale curated database that integrates single-cell transcriptomic profiles of nearly 2 million cells from 76 high-quality tumor datasets across 27 cancer types. All the data were uniformly processed with a standardized workflow, including quality control, batch effect removal, clustering, cell-type annotation, malignant cell classification, differential expression analysis and functional enrichment analysis. TISCH provides interactive gene expression visualization across multiple datasets at the single-cell level or cluster level, allowing systematic comparison between different cell-types, patients, tissue origins, treatment and response groups, and even different cancer-types. In summary, TISCH provides a user-friendly interface for systematically visualizing, searching and downloading gene expression atlas in the TME from multiple cancer types, enabling fast, flexible and comprehensive exploration of the TME.
33179736	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	FunRes: resolving tissue-specific functional cell states based on a cell-cell communication network model.	The functional specialization of cell types arises during development and is shaped by cell-cell communication networks determining a distribution of functional cell states that are collectively important for tissue functioning. However, the identification of these tissue-specific functional cell states remains challenging. Although a plethora of computational approaches have been successful in detecting cell types and subtypes, they fail in resolving tissue-specific functional cell states. To address this issue, we present FunRes, a computational method designed for the identification of functional cell states. FunRes relies on scRNA-seq data of a tissue to initially reconstruct the functional cell-cell communication network, which is leveraged for partitioning each cell type into functional cell states. We applied FunRes to 177 cell types in 10 different tissues and demonstrated that the detected states correspond to known functional cell states of various cell types, which cannot be recapitulated by existing computational tools. Finally, we characterize emerging and vanishing functional cell states in aging and disease, and demonstrate their involvement in key tissue functions. Thus, we believe that FunRes will be of great utility in the characterization of the functional landscape of cell types and the identification of dysfunctional cell states in aging and disease.
39748324	2025	Genome biology	Spatiotemporal dynamics of early oogenesis in pigs.	"BACKGROUND: In humans and other mammals, the process of oogenesis initiates asynchronously in specific ovarian regions, leading to the localization of dormant and growing follicles in the cortex and medulla, respectively; however, the current understanding of this process remains insufficient. RESULTS: Here, we integrate single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics (ST) to comprehend spatial-temporal gene expression profiles and explore the spatial organization of ovarian microenvironments during early oogenesis in pigs. Projection of the germ cell clusters at different stages of oogenesis into the spatial atlas unveils a ""cortical to medullary (C-M)"" distribution of germ cells in the developing porcine ovaries. Cross-species analysis between pigs and humans unveils a conserved C-M distribution pattern of germ cells during oogenesis, highlighting the utility of pigs as valuable models for studying human oogenesis in a spatial context. RNA velocity analysis with ST identifies the molecular characteristics and spatial dynamics of granulosa cell lineages originating from the cortical and medullary regions in pig ovaries. Spatial co-occurrence analysis and intercellular communication analysis unveils a distinct cell-cell communication pattern between germ cells and somatic cells in the cortex and medulla regions. Notably, in vitro culture of ovarian tissues verifies that intercellular NOTCH signaling and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins played crucial roles in initiating meiotic and oogenic programs, highlighting an underappreciated role of ovarian microenvironments in orchestrating germ cell fates. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our work provides insight into the spatial characteristics of early oogenesis and the regulatory role of ovarian microenvironments in germ cell fate within a spatial context."
34999761	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scNAME: neighborhood contrastive clustering with ancillary mask estimation for scRNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: The rapid development of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) makes it possible to study the heterogeneity of individual cell characteristics. Cell clustering is a vital procedure in scRNA-seq analysis, providing insight into complex biological phenomena. However, the noisy, high-dimensional and large-scale nature of scRNA-seq data introduces challenges in clustering analysis. Up to now, many deep learning-based methods have emerged to learn underlying feature representations while clustering. However, these methods are inefficient when it comes to rare cell type identification and barely able to fully utilize gene dependencies or cell similarity integrally. As a result, they cannot detect a clear cell type structure which is required for clustering accuracy as well as downstream analysis. RESULTS: Here, we propose a novel scRNA-seq clustering algorithm called scNAME which incorporates a mask estimation task for gene pertinence mining and a neighborhood contrastive learning framework for cell intrinsic structure exploitation. The learned pattern through mask estimation helps reveal uncorrupted data structure and denoise the original single-cell data. In addition, the randomly created augmented data introduced in contrastive learning not only helps improve robustness of clustering, but also increases sample size in each cluster for better data capacity. Beyond this, we also introduce a neighborhood contrastive paradigm with an offline memory bank, global in scope, which can inspire discriminative feature representation and achieve intra-cluster compactness, yet inter-cluster separation. The combination of mask estimation task, neighborhood contrastive learning and global memory bank designed in scNAME is conductive to rare cell type detection. The experimental results of both simulations and real data confirm that our method is accurate, robust and scalable. We also implement biological analysis, including marker gene identification, gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis, to validate the biological significance of our method. To the best of our knowledge, we are among the first to introduce a gene relationship exploration strategy, as well as a global cellular similarity repository, in the single-cell field. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: An implementation of scNAME is available from https://github.com/aster-ww/scNAME.

31992615	2020	Genome research	SHARP: hyperfast and accurate processing of single-cell RNA-seq data via ensemble random projection.	To process large-scale single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data effectively without excessive distortion during dimension reduction, we present SHARP, an ensemble random projection-based algorithm that is scalable to clustering 10 million cells. Comprehensive benchmarking tests on 17 public scRNA-seq data sets show that SHARP outperforms existing methods in terms of speed and accuracy. Particularly, for large-size data sets (more than 40,000 cells), SHARP runs faster than other competitors while maintaining high clustering accuracy and robustness. To the best of our knowledge, SHARP is the only R-based tool that is scalable to clustering scRNA-seq data with 10 million cells.
38819254	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	PIPET: predicting relevant subpopulations in single-cell data using phenotypic information from bulk data.	Single-cell RNA sequencing has revealed cellular heterogeneity in complex tissues, notably benefiting research on diseases such as cancer. However, the integration of single-cell data from small samples with extensive clinical features in bulk data remains underexplored. In this study, we introduce PIPET, an algorithmic method for predicting relevant subpopulations in single-cell data based on multivariate phenotypic information from bulk data. PIPET generates feature vectors for each phenotype from differentially expressed genes in bulk data and then identifies relevant cellular subpopulations by assessing the similarity between single-cell data and these vectors. Subsequently, phenotype-related cell states can be analyzed based on these subpopulations. In simulated datasets, PIPET showed robust performance in predicting multiclassification cellular subpopulations. Application of PIPET to lung adenocarcinoma single-cell RNA sequencing data revealed cellular subpopulations with poor survival and associations with TP53 mutations. Similarly, in breast cancer single-cell data, PIPET identified cellular subpopulations associated with the PAM50 clinical subtypes and triple-negative breast cancer subtypes. Overall, PIPET effectively identified relevant cellular subpopulations in single-cell data, guided by phenotypic information from bulk data. This approach comprehensively delineates the molecular characteristics of each cellular subpopulation, offering insights into disease-related subpopulations and guiding personalized treatment strategies.
35758822	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Semi-deconvolution of bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data with application to metastatic progression in breast cancer.	MOTIVATION: Identifying cell types and their abundances and how these evolve during tumor progression is critical to understanding the mechanisms of metastasis and identifying predictors of metastatic potential that can guide the development of new diagnostics or therapeutics. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been especially promising in resolving heterogeneity of expression programs at the single-cell level, but is not always feasible, e.g. for large cohort studies or longitudinal analysis of archived samples. In such cases, clonal subpopulations may still be inferred via genomic deconvolution, but deconvolution methods have limited ability to resolve fine clonal structure and may require reference cell type profiles that are missing or imprecise. Prior methods can eliminate the need for reference profiles but show unstable performance when few bulk samples are available. RESULTS: In this work, we develop a new method using reference scRNA-seq to interpret sample collections for which only bulk RNA-seq is available for some samples, e.g. clonally resolving archived primary tissues using scRNA-seq from metastases. By integrating such information in a Quadratic Programming framework, our method can recover more accurate cell types and corresponding cell type abundances in bulk samples. Application to a breast tumor bone metastases dataset confirms the power of scRNA-seq data to improve cell type inference and quantification in same-patient bulk samples. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Source code is available on Github at https://github.com/CMUSchwartzLab/RADs.
28346451	2017	Nature methods	SC3: consensus clustering of single-cell RNA-seq data.	Single-cell RNA-seq enables the quantitative characterization of cell types based on global transcriptome profiles. We present single-cell consensus clustering (SC3), a user-friendly tool for unsupervised clustering, which achieves high accuracy and robustness by combining multiple clustering solutions through a consensus approach (http://bioconductor.org/packages/SC3). We demonstrate that SC3 is capable of identifying subclones from the transcriptomes of neoplastic cells collected from patients.
37653425	2023	Genome biology	Single-cell transcriptomics reveals multiple chemoresistant properties in leukemic stem and progenitor cells in pediatric AML.	BACKGROUND: Cancer patients can achieve dramatic responses to chemotherapy yet retain resistant tumor cells, which ultimately results in relapse. Although xenograft model studies have identified several cellular and molecular features that are associated with chemoresistance in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), to what extent AML patients exhibit these properties remains largely unknown. RESULTS: We apply single-cell RNA sequencing to paired pre- and post-chemotherapy whole bone marrow samples obtained from 13 pediatric AML patients who had achieved disease remission, and distinguish AML clusters from normal cells based on their unique transcriptomic profiles. Approximately 50% of leukemic stem and progenitor populations actively express leukemia stem cell (LSC) and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) signatures, respectively. These clusters have a higher chance of tolerating therapy and exhibit an enhanced metabolic program in response to treatment. Interestingly, the transmembrane receptor CD69 is highly expressed in chemoresistant hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-like populations (named the CD69(+) HSC-like subpopulation). Furthermore, overexpression of CD69 results in suppression of the mTOR signaling pathway and promotion of cell quiescence and adhesion in vitro. Finally, the presence of CD69(+) HSC-like cells is associated with unfavorable genetic mutations, the persistence of residual tumor cells in chemotherapy, and poor outcomes in independent pediatric and adult public AML cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis reveals leukemia stem cell and OXPHOS as two major chemoresistant features in human AML patients. CD69 may serve as a potential biomarker in defining a subpopulation of chemoresistant leukemia stem cells. These findings have important implications for targeting residual chemo-surviving AML cells.
35924984	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	ASURAT: functional annotation-driven unsupervised clustering of single-cell transcriptomes.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis reveals heterogeneity and dynamic cell transitions. However, conventional gene-based analyses require intensive manual curation to interpret biological implications of computational results. Hence, a theory for efficiently annotating individual cells remains warranted. RESULTS: We present ASURAT, a computational tool for simultaneously performing unsupervised clustering and functional annotation of disease, cell type, biological process and signaling pathway activity for single-cell transcriptomic data, using a correlation graph decomposition for genes in database-derived functional terms. We validated the usability and clustering performance of ASURAT using scRNA-seq datasets for human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which required fewer manual curations than existing methods. Moreover, we applied ASURAT to scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptome datasets for human small cell lung cancer and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, respectively, identifying previously overlooked subpopulations and differentially expressed genes. ASURAT is a powerful tool for dissecting cell subpopulations and improving biological interpretability of complex and noisy transcriptomic data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: ASURAT is published on Bioconductor (https://doi.org/10.18129/B9.bioc.ASURAT). The codes for analyzing data in this article are available at Github (https://github.com/keita-iida/ASURATBI) and figshare (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.19200254.v4).

MOTIVATION: Increasing numbers of large scale single cell RNA-Seq projects are leading to a data explosion, which can only be fully exploited through data integration. A number of methods have been developed to combine diverse datasets by removing technical batch effects, but most are computationally intensive. To overcome the challenge of enormous datasets, we have developed BBKNN, an extremely fast graph-based data integration algorithm. We illustrate the power of BBKNN on large scale mouse atlasing data, and favourably benchmark its run time against a number of competing methods.

34301623	2021	Genome research	A graph neural network model to estimate cell-wise metabolic flux using single-cell RNA-seq data.	The metabolic heterogeneity and metabolic interplay between cells are known as significant contributors to disease treatment resistance. However, with the lack of a mature high-throughput single-cell metabolomics technology, we are yet to establish systematic understanding of the intra-tissue metabolic heterogeneity and cooperative mechanisms. To mitigate this knowledge gap, we developed a novel computational method, namely, single-cell flux estimation analysis (scFEA), to infer the cell-wise fluxome from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. scFEA is empowered by a systematically reconstructed human metabolic map as a factor graph, a novel probabilistic model to leverage the flux balance constraints on scRNA-seq data, and a novel graph neural network-based optimization solver. The intricate information cascade from transcriptome to metabolome was captured using multilayer neural networks to capitulate the nonlinear dependency between enzymatic gene expressions and reaction rates. We experimentally validated scFEA by generating an scRNA-seq data set with matched metabolomics data on cells of perturbed oxygen and genetic conditions. Application of scFEA on this data set showed the consistency between predicted flux and the observed variation of metabolite abundance in the matched metabolomics data. We also applied scFEA on five publicly available scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data sets and identified context- and cell group-specific metabolic variations. The cell-wise fluxome predicted by scFEA empowers a series of downstream analyses including identification of metabolic modules or cell groups that share common metabolic variations, sensitivity evaluation of enzymes with regards to their impact on the whole metabolic flux, and inference of cell-tissue and cell-cell metabolic communications.
37544659	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Single-cell causal network inferred by cross-mapping entropy.	Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) reveal the complex molecular interactions that govern cell state. However, it is challenging for identifying causal relations among genes due to noisy data and molecular nonlinearity. Here, we propose a novel causal criterion, neighbor cross-mapping entropy (NME), for inferring GRNs from both steady data and time-series data. NME is designed to quantify 'continuous causality' or functional dependency from one variable to another based on their function continuity with varying neighbor sizes. NME shows superior performance on benchmark datasets, comparing with existing methods. By applying to scRNA-seq datasets, NME not only reliably inferred GRNs for cell types but also identified cell states. Based on the inferred GRNs and further their activity matrices, NME showed better performance in single-cell clustering and downstream analyses. In summary, based on continuous causality, NME provides a powerful tool in inferring causal regulations of GRNs between genes from scRNA-seq data, which is further exploited to identify novel cell types/states and predict cell type-specific network modules.

32069291	2020	PLoS computational biology	Inferring TF activation order in time series scRNA-Seq studies.	Methods for the analysis of time series single cell expression data (scRNA-Seq) either do not utilize information about transcription factors (TFs) and their targets or only study these as a post-processing step. Using such information can both, improve the accuracy of the reconstructed model and cell assignments, while at the same time provide information on how and when the process is regulated. We developed the Continuous-State Hidden Markov Models TF (CSHMM-TF) method which integrates probabilistic modeling of scRNA-Seq data with the ability to assign TFs to specific activation points in the model. TFs are assumed to influence the emission probabilities for cells assigned to later time points allowing us to identify not just the TFs controlling each path but also their order of activation. We tested CSHMM-TF on several mouse and human datasets. As we show, the method was able to identify known and novel TFs for all processes, assigned time of activation agrees with both expression information and prior knowledge and combinatorial predictions are supported by known interactions. We also show that CSHMM-TF improves upon prior methods that do not utilize TF-gene interaction.
41067887	2025	Genome research	Recovering gene regulatory networks in single-cell multiomics data with PRISM-GRN.	Understanding Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) is crucial for deciphering cellular heterogeneity and the mechanisms underlying development and disease. However, current GRN inference methods fail to utilize multiomics data and prior knowledge from a biologically-interpretable insight. Therefore, we propose PRISM-GRN, a Bayesian model that seamlessly incorporates known GRNs, along with scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data, into a probabilistic framework to reconstruct cell type-specific GRNs. PRISM-GRN employs a biologically interpretable architecture firmly rooted in the established gene regulatory mechanism, which asserts that gene expression is influenced by TF expression levels and gene chromatin accessibility through GRNs. Accordingly, PRISM-GRN decomposes observable data into biologically meaningful latent variables through a mechanism-informed generation process and a prior-GRN-primed inference process, enabling precise and robust GRN reconstruction. We evaluate PRISM-GRN on four benchmarking datasets with paired scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data, demonstrating its superior performance over seven baseline methods in GRN reconstruction, especially its higher precision under the inherently imbalanced scenario where the true regulatory interaction is sparse. Furthermore, benchmarking on directed GRNs highlights PRISM-GRN's ability to capture causality in gene regulation derived from the biologically-interpretable architecture. More importantly, PRISM-GRN performs well with unpaired omics data and limited prior GRN information, showcasing its flexibility and adaptability across various biological contexts. Finally, biological analyses on PBMC datasets demonstrate PRISM-GRN's potential to facilitate the identification of cell type-specific or context-specific GRNs across broader real-world biological research applications. Overall, PRISM-GRN provides a novel paradigm for precise, robust, and interpretable exploration of causal GRNs with prior knowledge and multiomics data.
37026478	2023	Nucleic acids research	exFINDER: identify external communication signals using single-cell transcriptomics data.	Cells make decisions through their communication with other cells and receiving signals from their environment. Using single-cell transcriptomics, computational tools have been developed to infer cell-cell communication through ligands and receptors. However, the existing methods only deal with signals sent by the measured cells in the data, the received signals from the external system are missing in the inference. Here, we present exFINDER, a method that identifies such external signals received by the cells in the single-cell transcriptomics datasets by utilizing the prior knowledge of signaling pathways. In particular, exFINDER can uncover external signals that activate the given target genes, infer the external signal-target signaling network (exSigNet), and perform quantitative analysis on exSigNets. The applications of exFINDER to scRNA-seq datasets from different species demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of identifying external signals, revealing critical transition-related signaling activities, inferring critical external signals and targets, clustering signal-target paths, and evaluating relevant biological events. Overall, exFINDER can be applied to scRNA-seq data to reveal the external signal-associated activities and maybe novel cells that send such signals.
39921568	2025	Nucleic acids research	NEAT1-mediated regulation of proteostasis and mRNA localization impacts autophagy dysregulation in Rett syndrome.	Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder primarily caused by loss-of-function mutations in the MECP2 gene, resulting in diverse cellular dysfunctions. Here, we investigated the role of the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) NEAT1 in the context of MeCP2 deficiency using human neural cells and RTT patient samples. Through single-cell RNA sequencing and molecular analyses, we found that NEAT1 is markedly downregulated in MECP2 knockout (KO) cells at various stages of neural differentiation. NEAT1 downregulation correlated with aberrant activation of the mTOR pathway, abnormal protein metabolism, and dysregulated autophagy, contributing to the accumulation of protein aggregates and impaired mitochondrial function. Reactivation of NEAT1 in MECP2-KO cells rescued these phenotypes, indicating its critical role downstream of MECP2. Furthermore, direct RNA-RNA interaction was revealed as the key process for NEAT1 influence on autophagy genes, leading to altered subcellular localization of specific autophagy-related messenger RNAs and impaired biogenesis of autophagic complexes. Importantly, NEAT1 restoration rescued the morphological defects observed in MECP2-KO neurons, highlighting its crucial role in neuronal maturation. Overall, our findings elucidate lncRNA NEAT1 as a key mediator of MeCP2 function, regulating essential pathways involved in protein metabolism, autophagy, and neuronal morphology.

39898810	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Trajectory Inference with Cell-Cell Interactions (TICCI): intercellular communication improves the accuracy of trajectory inference methods.	MOTIVATION: Understanding cell differentiation and development dynamics is key for single-cell transcriptome analysis. Current cell differentiation trajectory inference algorithms face challenges such as high dimensionality, noise, and a need for users to possess certain biological information about the datasets to effectively utilize the algorithms. Here, we introduce Trajectory Inference with Cell-Cell Interaction (TICCI), a novel way to address these challenges by integrating intercellular communication information. In recognizing crucial intercellular communication during development, TICCI proposes Cell-Cell Interactions (CCI) at single-cell resolution. We posit that cells exhibiting higher gene expression similarity patterns are more likely to exchange information via biomolecular mediators. RESULTS: TICCI is initiated by constructing a cell-neighborhood matrix using edge weights composed of intercellular similarity and CCI information. Louvain partitioning identifies trajectory branches, attenuating noise, while single-cell entropy (scEntropy) is used to assess differentiation status. The Chu-Liu algorithm constructs a directed least-square model to identify trajectory branches, and an improved diffusion fitted time algorithm computes cell-fitted time in nonconnected topologies. TICCI validation on single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets confirms the accuracy of cell trajectories, aligning with genealogical branching and gene markers. Verification using extrinsic information labels demonstrates CCI information utility in enhancing accurate trajectory inference. A comparative analysis establishes TICCI proficiency in accurate temporal ordering. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Source code and binaries freely available for download at https://github.com/mine41/TICCI, implemented in R (version 4.32) and Python (version 3.7.16) and supported on MS Windows. Authors ensure that the software is available for a full two years following publication.
37858253	2023	Genome biology	GoM DE: interpreting structure in sequence count data with differential expression analysis allowing for grades of membership.	Parts-based representations, such as non-negative matrix factorization and topic modeling, have been used to identify structure from single-cell sequencing data sets, in particular structure that is not as well captured by clustering or other dimensionality reduction methods. However, interpreting the individual parts remains a challenge. To address this challenge, we extend methods for differential expression analysis by allowing cells to have partial membership to multiple groups. We call this grade of membership differential expression (GoM DE). We illustrate the benefits of GoM DE for annotating topics identified in several single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data sets.
32119079	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scRMD: imputation for single cell RNA-seq data via robust matrix decomposition.	MOTIVATION: Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology enables whole transcriptome profiling at single cell resolution and holds great promises in many biological and medical applications. Nevertheless, scRNA-seq often fails to capture expressed genes, leading to the prominent dropout problem. These dropouts cause many problems in down-stream analysis, such as significant increase of noises, power loss in differential expression analysis and obscuring of gene-to-gene or cell-to-cell relationship. Imputation of these dropout values can be beneficial in scRNA-seq data analysis. RESULTS: In this article, we model the dropout imputation problem as robust matrix decomposition. This model has minimal assumptions and allows us to develop a computational efficient imputation method called scRMD. Extensive data analysis shows that scRMD can accurately recover the dropout values and help to improve downstream analysis such as differential expression analysis and clustering analysis. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The R package scRMD is available at https://github.com/XiDsLab/scRMD. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
37125641	2023	Nucleic acids research	Inferring cell diversity in single cell data using consortium-scale epigenetic data as a biological anchor for cell identity.	Methods for cell clustering and gene expression from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data are essential for biological interpretation of cell processes. Here, we present TRIAGE-Cluster which uses genome-wide epigenetic data from diverse bio-samples to identify genes demarcating cell diversity in scRNA-seq data. By integrating patterns of repressive chromatin deposited across diverse cell types with weighted density estimation, TRIAGE-Cluster determines cell type clusters in a 2D UMAP space. We then present TRIAGE-ParseR, a machine learning method which evaluates gene expression rank lists to define gene groups governing the identity and function of cell types. We demonstrate the utility of this two-step approach using atlases of in vivo and in vitro cell diversification and organogenesis. We also provide a web accessible dashboard for analysis and download of data and software. Collectively, genome-wide epigenetic repression provides a versatile strategy to define cell diversity and study gene regulation of scRNA-seq data.
36318267	2022	Nucleic acids research	Estrogen regulates divergent transcriptional and epigenetic cell states in breast cancer.	Breast cancers are known to be driven by the transcription factor estrogen receptor and its ligand estrogen. While the receptor's cis-binding elements are known to vary between tumors, heterogeneity of hormone signaling at a single-cell level is unknown. In this study, we systematically tracked estrogen response across time at a single-cell level in multiple cell line and organoid models. To accurately model these changes, we developed a computational tool (TITAN) that quantifies signaling gradients in single-cell datasets. Using this approach, we found that gene expression response to estrogen is non-uniform, with distinct cell groups expressing divergent transcriptional networks. Pathway analysis suggested the two most distinct signatures are driven separately by ER and FOXM1. We observed that FOXM1 was indeed activated by phosphorylation upon estrogen stimulation and silencing of FOXM1 attenuated the relevant gene signature. Analysis of scRNA-seq data from patient samples confirmed the existence of these divergent cell groups, with the FOXM1 signature predominantly found in ER negative cells. Further, multi-omic single-cell experiments indicated that the different cell groups have distinct chromatin accessibility states. Our results provide a comprehensive insight into ER biology at the single-cell level and potential therapeutic strategies to mitigate resistance to therapy.
40037644	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Benchmarking copy number aberrations inference tools using single-cell multi-omics datasets.	Copy number alterations (CNAs) are an important type of genomic variation which play a crucial role in the initiation and progression of cancer. With the explosion of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), several computational methods have been developed to infer CNAs from scRNA-seq studies. However, to date, no independent studies have comprehensively benchmarked their performance. Herein, we evaluated five state-of-the-art methods based on their performance in tumor versus normal cell classification; CNAs profile accuracy, tumor subclone inference, and aneuploidy identification in non-malignant cells. Our results showed that Numbat outperformed others across most evaluation criteria, while CopyKAT excelled in scenarios when expression matrix alone was used as input. In specific tasks, SCEVAN showed the best performance in clonal breakpoint detection and Numbat showed high sensitivity in copy number neutral LOH (cnLOH) detection. Additionally, we investigated how referencing settings, inclusion of tumor microenvironment cells, tumor type, and tumor purity impact the performance of these tools. This study provides a valuable guideline for researchers in selecting the appropriate methods for their datasets.
34634807	2022	Nucleic acids research	VThunter: a database for single-cell screening of virus target cells in the animal kingdom.	Viral infectious diseases are a devastating and continuing threat to human and animal health. Receptor binding is the key step for viral entry into host cells. Therefore, recognizing viral receptors is fundamental for understanding the potential tissue tropism or host range of these pathogens. The rapid advancement of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has paved the way for studying the expression of viral receptors in different tissues of animal species at single-cell resolution, resulting in huge scRNA-seq datasets. However, effectively integrating or sharing these datasets among the research community is challenging, especially for laboratory scientists. In this study, we manually curated up-to-date datasets generated in animal scRNA-seq studies, analyzed them using a unified processing pipeline, and comprehensively annotated 107 viral receptors in 142 viruses and obtained accurate expression signatures in 2 100 962 cells from 47 animal species. Thus, the VThunter database provides a user-friendly interface for the research community to explore the expression signatures of viral receptors. VThunter offers an informative and convenient resource for scientists to better understand the interactions between viral receptors and animal viruses and to assess viral pathogenesis and transmission in species.

32716923	2020	PLoS computational biology	scPADGRN: A preconditioned ADMM approach for reconstructing dynamic gene regulatory network using single-cell RNA sequencing data.	"Disease development and cell differentiation both involve dynamic changes; therefore, the reconstruction of dynamic gene regulatory networks (DGRNs) is an important but difficult problem in systems biology. With recent technical advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), large volumes of scRNA-seq data are being obtained for various processes. However, most current methods of inferring DGRNs from bulk samples may not be suitable for scRNA-seq data. In this work, we present scPADGRN, a novel DGRN inference method using ""time-series"" scRNA-seq data. scPADGRN combines the preconditioned alternating direction method of multipliers with cell clustering for DGRN reconstruction. It exhibits advantages in accuracy, robustness and fast convergence. Moreover, a quantitative index called Differentiation Genes' Interaction Enrichment (DGIE) is presented to quantify the interaction enrichment of genes related to differentiation. From the DGIE scores of relevant subnetworks, we infer that the functions of embryonic stem (ES) cells are most active initially and may gradually fade over time. The communication strength of known contributing genes that facilitate cell differentiation increases from ES cells to terminally differentiated cells. We also identify several genes responsible for the changes in the DGIE scores occurring during cell differentiation based on three real single-cell datasets. Our results demonstrate that single-cell analyses based on network inference coupled with quantitative computations can reveal key transcriptional regulators involved in cell differentiation and disease development."

Full-length RNA-sequencing methods using long-read technologies can capture complete transcript isoforms, but their throughput is limited. We introduce multiplexed arrays isoform sequencing (MAS-ISO-seq), a technique for programmably concatenating complementary DNAs (cDNAs) into molecules optimal for long-read sequencing, increasing the throughput >15-fold to nearly 40 million cDNA reads per run on the Sequel IIe sequencer. When applied to single-cell RNA sequencing of tumor-infiltrating T cells, MAS-ISO-seq demonstrated a 12- to 32-fold increase in the discovery of differentially spliced genes.

RESULTS: We present scBatch, a numerical algorithm for batch-effect correction on bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data with emphasis on improving both clustering and gene differential expression analysis. scBatch is not restricted by assumptions on the mechanism of batch-effect generation. As shown in simulations and real data analyses, scBatch outperforms benchmark batch-effect correction methods.

31372651	2019	Nucleic acids research	Nonparametric expression analysis using inferential replicate counts.	A primary challenge in the analysis of RNA-seq data is to identify differentially expressed genes or transcripts while controlling for technical biases. Ideally, a statistical testing procedure should incorporate the inherent uncertainty of the abundance estimates arising from the quantification step. Most popular methods for RNA-seq differential expression analysis fit a parametric model to the counts for each gene or transcript, and a subset of methods can incorporate uncertainty. Previous work has shown that nonparametric models for RNA-seq differential expression may have better control of the false discovery rate, and adapt well to new data types without requiring reformulation of a parametric model. Existing nonparametric models do not take into account inferential uncertainty, leading to an inflated false discovery rate, in particular at the transcript level. We propose a nonparametric model for differential expression analysis using inferential replicate counts, extending the existing SAMseq method to account for inferential uncertainty. We compare our method, Swish, with popular differential expression analysis methods. Swish has improved control of the false discovery rate, in particular for transcripts with high inferential uncertainty. We apply Swish to a single-cell RNA-seq dataset, assessing differential expression between sub-populations of cells, and compare its performance to the Wilcoxon test.
37537644	2023	Genome biology	BEDwARS: a robust Bayesian approach to bulk gene expression deconvolution with noisy reference signatures.	Differential gene expression in bulk transcriptomics data can reflect change of transcript abundance within a cell type and/or change in the proportions of cell types. Expression deconvolution methods can help differentiate these scenarios. BEDwARS is a Bayesian deconvolution method designed to address differences between reference signatures of cell types and corresponding true signatures underlying bulk transcriptomic profiles. BEDwARS is more robust to noisy reference signatures and outperforms leading in-class methods for estimating cell type proportions and signatures. Application of BEDwARS to dihydropyridine dehydrogenase deficiency identified the possible involvement of ciliopathy and impaired translational control in the etiology of the disorder.
29898899	2018	Genome research	Linking transcriptional and genetic tumor heterogeneity through allele analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data.	Characterization of intratumoral heterogeneity is critical to cancer therapy, as the presence of phenotypically diverse cell populations commonly fuels relapse and resistance to treatment. Although genetic variation is a well-studied source of intratumoral heterogeneity, the functional impact of most genetic alterations remains unclear. Even less understood is the relative importance of other factors influencing heterogeneity, such as epigenetic state or tumor microenvironment. To investigate the relationship between genetic and transcriptional heterogeneity in a context of cancer progression, we devised a computational approach called HoneyBADGER to identify copy number variation and loss of heterozygosity in individual cells from single-cell RNA-sequencing data. By integrating allele and normalized expression information, HoneyBADGER is able to identify and infer the presence of subclone-specific alterations in individual cells and reconstruct the underlying subclonal architecture. By examining several tumor types, we show that HoneyBADGER is effective at identifying deletions, amplifications, and copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity events and is capable of robustly identifying subclonal focal alterations as small as 10 megabases. We further apply HoneyBADGER to analyze single cells from a progressive multiple myeloma patient to identify major genetic subclones that exhibit distinct transcriptional signatures relevant to cancer progression. Other prominent transcriptional subpopulations within these tumors did not line up with the genetic subclonal structure and were likely driven by alternative, nonclonal mechanisms. These results highlight the need for integrative analysis to understand the molecular and phenotypic heterogeneity in cancer.
34535795	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	Network-based analysis revealed significant interactions between risk genes of severe COVID-19 and host genes interacted with SARS-CoV-2 proteins.	Whether risk genes of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from genome-wide association study could play their regulatory roles by interacting with host genes that were interacted with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) proteins was worthy of exploration. In this study, we implemented a network-based approach by developing a user-friendly software Network Calculator (https://github.com/Haoxiang-Qi/Network-Calculator.git). By using Network Calculator, we identified a network composed of 13 risk genes and 28 SARS-CoV-2 interacted host genes that had the highest network proximity with each other, with a hub gene HNRNPK identified. Among these genes, 14 of them were identified to be differentially expressed in RNA-seq data from severe COVID-19 cases. Besides, by expression enrichment analysis in single-cell RNA-seq data, compared with mild COVID-19, these genes were significantly enriched in macrophage, T cell and epithelial cell for severe COVID-19. Meanwhile, 74 pathways were significantly enriched. Our analysis provided insights for the underlying genetic etiology of severe COVID-19 from the perspective of network biology.
32588900	2020	Nucleic acids research	scIGANs: single-cell RNA-seq imputation using generative adversarial networks.	Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables the characterization of transcriptomic profiles at the single-cell resolution with increasingly high throughput. However, it suffers from many sources of technical noises, including insufficient mRNA molecules that lead to excess false zero values, termed dropouts. Computational approaches have been proposed to recover the biologically meaningful expression by borrowing information from similar cells in the observed dataset. However, these methods suffer from oversmoothing and removal of natural cell-to-cell stochasticity in gene expression. Here, we propose the generative adversarial networks (GANs) for scRNA-seq imputation (scIGANs), which uses generated cells rather than observed cells to avoid these limitations and balances the performance between major and rare cell populations. Evaluations based on a variety of simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets show that scIGANs is effective for dropout imputation and enhances various downstream analysis. ScIGANs is robust to small datasets that have very few genes with low expression and/or cell-to-cell variance. ScIGANs works equally well on datasets from different scRNA-seq protocols and is scalable to datasets with over 100 000 cells. We demonstrated in many ways with compelling evidence that scIGANs is not only an application of GANs in omics data but also represents a competing imputation method for the scRNA-seq data.
31870412	2019	Genome biology	Feature selection and dimension reduction for single-cell RNA-Seq based on a multinomial model.	Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) profiles gene expression of individual cells. Recent scRNA-Seq datasets have incorporated unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). Using negative controls, we show UMI counts follow multinomial sampling with no zero inflation. Current normalization procedures such as log of counts per million and feature selection by highly variable genes produce false variability in dimension reduction. We propose simple multinomial methods, including generalized principal component analysis (GLM-PCA) for non-normal distributions, and feature selection using deviance. These methods outperform the current practice in a downstream clustering assessment using ground truth datasets.
32450895	2020	Genome biology	Accounting for cell type hierarchy in evaluating single cell RNA-seq clustering.	Cell clustering is one of the most common routines in single cell RNA-seq data analyses, for which a number of specialized methods are available. The evaluation of these methods ignores an important biological characteristic that the structure for a population of cells is hierarchical, which could result in misleading evaluation results. In this work, we develop two new metrics that take into account the hierarchical structure of cell types. We illustrate the application of the new metrics in constructed examples as well as several real single cell datasets and show that they provide more biologically plausible results.
40889117	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	scSorterDL: a deep neural network-enhanced ensemble LDAs for single cell classifications.	The emergence of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has transformed our understanding of cellular diversity, yet it presents notable challenges for cell type annotation due to data's high dimensionality and sparsity. To tackle these issues, we present scSorterDL, an innovative approach that combines penalized Linear Discriminant Analysis (pLDA), swarm learning, and deep neural networks (DNNs) to improve cell type classification. In scSorterDL, we generate numerous random subsets of the data and apply pLDA models to each subset to capture varied data aspects. The model outputs are then consolidated using a DNN that identifies complex relationships among the pLDA scores, enhancing classification accuracy by considering interactions that simpler methods might overlook. Utilizing GPU computing for both swarm learning and deep learning, scSorterDL adeptly manages large datasets and high-dimensional gene expression data. We tested scSorterDL on 13 real scRNA-seq datasets from diverse species, tissues, and platforms, as well as on 20 pairs of cross-platform datasets. Our method surpassed nine current cell annotation tools in both accuracy and robustness, indicating exceptional performance in both cross-validation and cross-platform contexts. These findings underscore the potential of scSorterDL as an effective and adaptable tool for automated cell type annotation in scRNA-seq research. The code is available on GitHub: https://github.com/kellen8hao/scSorterDL.
27368803	2016	Genome biology	GiniClust: detecting rare cell types from single-cell gene expression data with Gini index.	High-throughput single-cell technologies have great potential to discover new cell types; however, it remains challenging to detect rare cell types that are distinct from a large population. We present a novel computational method, called GiniClust, to overcome this challenge. Validation against a benchmark dataset indicates that GiniClust achieves high sensitivity and specificity. Application of GiniClust to public single-cell RNA-seq datasets uncovers previously unrecognized rare cell types, including Zscan4-expressing cells within mouse embryonic stem cells and hemoglobin-expressing cells in the mouse cortex and hippocampus. GiniClust also correctly detects a small number of normal cells that are mixed in a cancer cell population.
34963480	2021	Genome biology	Cobolt: integrative analysis of multimodal single-cell sequencing data.	A growing number of single-cell sequencing platforms enable joint profiling of multiple omics from the same cells. We present Cobolt, a novel method that not only allows for analyzing the data from joint-modality platforms, but provides a coherent framework for the integration of multiple datasets measured on different modalities. We demonstrate its performance on multi-modality data of gene expression and chromatin accessibility and illustrate the integration abilities of Cobolt by jointly analyzing this multi-modality data with single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq datasets.
39438735	2024	Nature methods	Differentiating visceral sensory ganglion organoids from induced pluripotent stem cells.	The ability to generate visceral sensory neurons (VSN) from induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells may help to gain insights into how the gut-nerve-brain axis is involved in neurological disorders. We established a protocol to differentiate human iPS-cell-derived visceral sensory ganglion organoids (VSGOs). VSGOs exhibit canonical VSN markers, and single-cell RNA sequencing revealed heterogenous molecular signatures and developmental trajectories of VSGOs aligned with native VSN. We integrated VSGOs with human colon organoids on a microfluidic device and applied this axis-on-a-chip model to Alzheimer's disease. Our results suggest that VSN could be a potential mediator for propagating gut-derived amyloid and tau to the brain in an APOE4- and LRP1-dependent manner. Furthermore, our approach was extended to include patient-derived iPS cells, which demonstrated a strong correlation with clinical data.
29855333	2018	Genome biology	UMI-count modeling and differential expression analysis for single-cell RNA sequencing.	Read counting and unique molecular identifier (UMI) counting are the principal gene expression quantification schemes used in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis. By using multiple scRNA-seq datasets, we reveal distinct distribution differences between these schemes and conclude that the negative binomial model is a good approximation for UMI counts, even in heterogeneous populations. We further propose a novel differential expression analysis algorithm based on a negative binomial model with independent dispersions in each group (NBID). Our results show that this properly controls the FDR and achieves better power for UMI counts when compared to other recently developed packages for scRNA-seq analysis.
32053182	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	ZIAQ: a quantile regression method for differential expression analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has enabled the simultaneous transcriptomic profiling of individual cells under different biological conditions. scRNA-seq data have two unique challenges that can affect the sensitivity and specificity of single-cell differential expression analysis: a large proportion of expressed genes with zero or low read counts ('dropout' events) and multimodal data distributions. RESULTS: We have developed a zero-inflation-adjusted quantile (ZIAQ) algorithm, which is the first method to account for both dropout rates and complex scRNA-seq data distributions in the same model. ZIAQ demonstrates superior performance over several existing methods on simulated scRNA-seq datasets by finding more differentially expressed genes. When ZIAQ was applied to the comparison of neoplastic and non-neoplastic cells from a human glioblastoma dataset, the ranking of biologically relevant genes and pathways showed clear improvement over existing methods. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: ZIAQ is implemented in the R language and available at https://github.com/gefeizhang/ZIAQ.

34020534	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	scCancer: a package for automated processing of single-cell RNA-seq data in cancer.	Molecular heterogeneities and complex microenvironments bring great challenges for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Recent advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology make it possible to study cancer cell heterogeneities and microenvironments at single-cell transcriptomic level. Here, we develop an R package named scCancer, which focuses on processing and analyzing scRNA-seq data for cancer research. Except basic data processing steps, this package takes several special considerations for cancer-specific features. Firstly, the package introduced comprehensive quality control metrics. Secondly, it used a data-driven machine learning algorithm to accurately identify major cancer microenvironment cell populations. Thirdly, it estimated a malignancy score to classify malignant (cancerous) and non-malignant cells. Then, it analyzed intra-tumor heterogeneities by key cellular phenotypes (such as cell cycle and stemness), gene signatures and cell-cell interactions. Besides, it provided multi-sample data integration analysis with different batch-effect correction strategies. Finally, user-friendly graphic reports were generated for all the analyses. By testing on 56 samples with 433 405 cells in total, we demonstrated its good performance. The package is available at: http://lifeome.net/software/sccancer/.
27153613	2016	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Quality control of single-cell RNA-seq by SinQC.	Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) is emerging as a promising technology for profiling cell-to-cell variability in cell populations. However, the combination of technical noise and intrinsic biological variability makes detecting technical artifacts in scRNA-seq samples particularly challenging. Proper detection of technical artifacts is critical to prevent spurious results during downstream analysis. In this study, we present 'Single-cell RNA-seq Quality Control' (SinQC), a method and software tool to detect technical artifacts in scRNA-seq samples by integrating both gene expression patterns and data quality information. We apply SinQC to nine different scRNA-seq datasets, and show that SinQC is a useful tool for controlling scRNA-seq data quality. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: SinQC software and documents are available at http://www.morgridge.net/SinQC.html CONTACTS: : PJiang@morgridge.org or RStewart@morgridge.org SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
28582478	2017	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Model-based branching point detection in single-cell data by K-branches clustering.	MOTIVATION: The identification of heterogeneities in cell populations by utilizing single-cell technologies such as single-cell RNA-Seq, enables inference of cellular development and lineage trees. Several methods have been proposed for such inference from high-dimensional single-cell data. They typically assign each cell to a branch in a differentiation trajectory. However, they commonly assume specific geometries such as tree-like developmental hierarchies and lack statistically sound methods to decide on the number of branching events. RESULTS: We present K-Branches, a solution to the above problem by locally fitting half-lines to single-cell data, introducing a clustering algorithm similar to K-Means. These halflines are proxies for branches in the differentiation trajectory of cells. We propose a modified version of the GAP statistic for model selection, in order to decide on the number of lines that best describe the data locally. In this manner, we identify the location and number of subgroups of cells that are associated with branching events and full differentiation, respectively. We evaluate the performance of our method on single-cell RNA-Seq data describing the differentiation of myeloid progenitors during hematopoiesis, single-cell qPCR data of mouse blastocyst development, single-cell qPCR data of human myeloid monocytic leukemia and artificial data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: An R implementation of K-Branches is freely available at https://github.com/theislab/kbranches. CONTACT: fabian.theis@helmholtz-muenchen.de.

36163550	2023	Nature biotechnology	Haplotype-aware analysis of somatic copy number variations from single-cell transcriptomes.	Genome instability and aberrant alterations of transcriptional programs both play important roles in cancer. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has the potential to investigate both genetic and nongenetic sources of tumor heterogeneity in a single assay. Here we present a computational method, Numbat, that integrates haplotype information obtained from population-based phasing with allele and expression signals to enhance detection of copy number variations from scRNA-seq. Numbat exploits the evolutionary relationships between subclones to iteratively infer single-cell copy number profiles and tumor clonal phylogeny. Analysis of 22 tumor samples, including multiple myeloma, gastric, breast and thyroid cancers, shows that Numbat can reconstruct the tumor copy number profile and precisely identify malignant cells in the tumor microenvironment. We identify genetic subpopulations with transcriptional signatures relevant to tumor progression and therapy resistance. Numbat requires neither sample-matched DNA data nor a priori genotyping, and is applicable to a wide range of experimental settings and cancer types.
31209384	2019	Nature methods	MULTI-seq: sample multiplexing for single-cell RNA sequencing using lipid-tagged indices.	Sample multiplexing facilitates scRNA-seq by reducing costs and identifying artifacts such as cell doublets. However, universal and scalable sample barcoding strategies have not been described. We therefore developed MULTI-seq: multiplexing using lipid-tagged indices for single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing. MULTI-seq reagents can barcode any cell type or nucleus from any species with an accessible plasma membrane. The method involves minimal sample processing, thereby preserving cell viability and endogenous gene expression patterns. When cells are classified into sample groups using MULTI-seq barcode abundances, data quality is improved through doublet identification and recovery of cells with low RNA content that would otherwise be discarded by standard quality-control workflows. We use MULTI-seq to track the dynamics of T-cell activation, perform a 96-plex perturbation experiment with primary human mammary epithelial cells and multiplex cryopreserved tumors and metastatic sites isolated from a patient-derived xenograft mouse model of triple-negative breast cancer.
28759029	2017	Nature methods	Simultaneous epitope and transcriptome measurement in single cells.	High-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing has transformed our understanding of complex cell populations, but it does not provide phenotypic information such as cell-surface protein levels. Here, we describe cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq), a method in which oligonucleotide-labeled antibodies are used to integrate cellular protein and transcriptome measurements into an efficient, single-cell readout. CITE-seq is compatible with existing single-cell sequencing approaches and scales readily with throughput increases.
38940162	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Optimal sequencing budget allocation for trajectory reconstruction of single cells.	BACKGROUND: Charting cellular trajectories over gene expression is key to understanding dynamic cellular processes and their underlying mechanisms. While advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing technologies and computational methods have pushed forward the recovery of such trajectories, trajectory inference remains a challenge due to the noisy, sparse, and high-dimensional nature of single-cell data. This challenge can be alleviated by increasing either the number of cells sampled along the trajectory (breadth) or the sequencing depth, i.e. the number of reads captured per cell (depth). Generally, these two factors are coupled due to an inherent breadth-depth tradeoff that arises when the sequencing budget is constrained due to financial or technical limitations. RESULTS: Here we study the optimal allocation of a fixed sequencing budget to optimize the recovery of trajectory attributes. Empirical results reveal that reconstruction accuracy of internal cell structure in expression space scales with the logarithm of either the breadth or depth of sequencing. We additionally observe a power law relationship between the optimal number of sampled cells and the corresponding sequencing budget. For linear trajectories, non-monotonicity in trajectory reconstruction across the breadth-depth tradeoff can impact downstream inference, such as expression pattern analysis along the trajectory. We demonstrate these results for five single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets encompassing differentiation of embryonic stem cells, pancreatic beta cells, hepatoblast and multipotent hematopoietic cells, as well as induced reprogramming of embryonic fibroblasts into neurons. By addressing the challenges of single-cell data, our study offers insights into maximizing the efficiency of cellular trajectory analysis through strategic allocation of sequencing resources.
38886006	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	LogicGep: Boolean networks inference using symbolic regression from time-series transcriptomic profiling data.	Reconstructing the topology of gene regulatory network from gene expression data has been extensively studied. With the abundance functional transcriptomic data available, it is now feasible to systematically decipher regulatory interaction dynamics in a logic form such as a Boolean network (BN) framework, which qualitatively indicates how multiple regulators aggregated to affect a common target gene. However, inferring both the network topology and gene interaction dynamics simultaneously is still a challenging problem since gene expression data are typically noisy and data discretization is prone to information loss. We propose a new method for BN inference from time-series transcriptional profiles, called LogicGep. LogicGep formulates the identification of Boolean functions as a symbolic regression problem that learns the Boolean function expression and solve it efficiently through multi-objective optimization using an improved gene expression programming algorithm. To avoid overly emphasizing dynamic characteristics at the expense of topology structure ones, as traditional methods often do, a set of promising Boolean formulas for each target gene is evolved firstly, and a feed-forward neural network trained with continuous expression data is subsequently employed to pick out the final solution. We validated the efficacy of LogicGep using multiple datasets including both synthetic and real-world experimental data. The results elucidate that LogicGep adeptly infers accurate BN models, outperforming other representative BN inference algorithms in both network topology reconstruction and the identification of Boolean functions. Moreover, the execution of LogicGep is hundreds of times faster than other methods, especially in the case of large network inference.
31405383	2019	Genome biology	BERMUDA: a novel deep transfer learning method for single-cell RNA sequencing batch correction reveals hidden high-resolution cellular subtypes.	To fully utilize the power of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies for identifying cell lineages and bona fide transcriptional signals, it is necessary to combine data from multiple experiments. We present BERMUDA (Batch Effect ReMoval Using Deep Autoencoders), a novel transfer-learning-based method for batch effect correction in scRNA-seq data. BERMUDA effectively combines different batches of scRNA-seq data with vastly different cell population compositions and amplifies biological signals by transferring information among batches. We demonstrate that BERMUDA outperforms existing methods for removing batch effects and distinguishing cell types in multiple simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets.
34553226	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	Consensus-based clustering of single cells by reconstructing cell-to-cell dissimilarity.	The development of single-cell ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has led to great opportunities for the identification of heterogeneous cell types in complex tissues. Clustering algorithms are of great importance to effectively identify different cell types. In addition, the definition of the distance between each two cells is a critical step for most clustering algorithms. In this study, we found that different distance measures have considerably different effects on clustering algorithms. Moreover, there is no specific distance measure that is applicable to all datasets. In this study, we introduce a new single-cell clustering method called SD-h, which generates an applicable distance measure for different kinds of datasets by optimally synthesizing commonly used distance measures. Then, hierarchical clustering is performed based on the new distance measure for more accurate cell-type clustering. SD-h was tested on nine frequently used scRNA-seq datasets and it showed great superiority over almost all the compared leading single-cell clustering algorithms.
38390963	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Phenotype prediction from single-cell RNA-seq data using attention-based neural networks.	MOTIVATION: A patient's disease phenotype can be driven and determined by specific groups of cells whose marker genes are either unknown or can only be detected at late-stage using conventional bulk assays such as RNA-Seq technology. Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enable gene expression profiling in cell-level resolution, and therefore have the potential to identify those cells driving the disease phenotype even while the number of these cells is small. However, most existing methods rely heavily on accurate cell type detection, and the number of available annotated samples is usually too small for training deep learning predictive models. RESULTS: Here, we propose the method ScRAT for phenotype prediction using scRNA-seq data. To train ScRAT with a limited number of samples of different phenotypes, such as coronavirus disease (COVID) and non-COVID, ScRAT first applies a mixup module to increase the number of training samples. A multi-head attention mechanism is employed to learn the most informative cells for each phenotype without relying on a given cell type annotation. Using three public COVID datasets, we show that ScRAT outperforms other phenotype prediction methods. The performance edge of ScRAT over its competitors increases as the number of training samples decreases, indicating the efficacy of our sample mixup. Critical cell types detected based on high-attention cells also support novel findings in the original papers and the recent literature. This suggests that ScRAT overcomes the challenge of missing marker genes and limited sample number with great potential revealing novel molecular mechanisms and/or therapies. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The code of our proposed method ScRAT is published at https://github.com/yuzhenmao/ScRAT.
36300619	2023	Nucleic acids research	CellMarker 2.0: an updated database of manually curated cell markers in human/mouse and web tools based on scRNA-seq data.	CellMarker 2.0 (http://bio-bigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/CellMarker or http://117.50.127.228/CellMarker/) is an updated database that provides a manually curated collection of experimentally supported markers of various cell types in different tissues of human and mouse. In addition, web tools for analyzing single cell sequencing data are described. We have updated CellMarker 2.0 with more data and several new features, including (i) Appending 36 300 tissue-cell type-maker entries, 474 tissues, 1901 cell types and 4566 markers over the previous version. The current release recruits 26 915 cell markers, 2578 cell types and 656 tissues, resulting in a total of 83 361 tissue-cell type-maker entries. (ii) There is new marker information from 48 sequencing technology sources, including 10X Chromium, Smart-Seq2 and Drop-seq, etc. (iii) Adding 29 types of cell markers, including protein-coding gene lncRNA and processed pseudogene, etc. Additionally, six flexible web tools, including cell annotation, cell clustering, cell malignancy, cell differentiation, cell feature and cell communication, were developed to analysis and visualization of single cell sequencing data. CellMarker 2.0 is a valuable resource for exploring markers of various cell types in different tissues of human and mouse.
40795161	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Multi-omics single-cell data alignment and integration with enhanced contrastive learning and differential attention mechanism.	MOTIVATION: Identifying cell types that constitute complex tissue components using single-cell sequencing data is a critical issue in the field of biology. With the continuous advancement of sequencing technologies, the recognition of cell types has evolved from analyzing single-omics scRNA-seq data to integrating multi-omics single-cell data. However, existing methods for integrative analysis of high-dimensional multi-omics single-cell sequencing data have several limitations, including reliance on specific distribution assumptions of the data, sensitivity to noise, and clustering accuracy constrained by independent clustering methods. These issues have restricted improvements in the accuracy of cell type identification and hindered the application of such methods to large-scale datasets for cell type recognition. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method for aligning and integrating single-cell multi-omics data-scECDA. RESULTS: The scECDA employs independently designed autoencoders that can autonomously learn the feature distributions of each omics dataset. By incorporating enhanced contrastive learning and differential attention mechanisms, the scECDA effectively reduces the interference of noise during data integration. The model design exhibits high flexibility, enabling adaptation to single-cell omics data generated by different technological platforms. It directly outputs integrated latent features and end-to-end cell clustering results. Through the analysis of the distribution of latent features, the scECDA can effectively identify key biological markers and precisely distinguish cell subtypes, recover cluster-specific motif and infer trajectory. The scECDA was applied to eight paired single-cell multi-omics datasets, covering data generated by 10X Multiome, CITE-seq, and TEA-seq technologies. Compared to eight state-of-the-art methods, scECDA demonstrated higher accuracy in cell clustering. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The scECDA code is freely available at https://github.com/SuperheroBetter/scECDA.
29208629	2018	Genome research	SIDR: simultaneous isolation and parallel sequencing of genomic DNA and total RNA from single cells.	Simultaneous sequencing of the genome and transcriptome at the single-cell level is a powerful tool for characterizing genomic and transcriptomic variation and revealing correlative relationships. However, it remains technically challenging to analyze both the genome and transcriptome in the same cell. Here, we report a novel method for simultaneous isolation of genomic DNA and total RNA (SIDR) from single cells, achieving high recovery rates with minimal cross-contamination, as is crucial for accurate description and integration of the single-cell genome and transcriptome. For reliable and efficient separation of genomic DNA and total RNA from single cells, the method uses hypotonic lysis to preserve nuclear lamina integrity and subsequently captures the cell lysate using antibody-conjugated magnetic microbeads. Evaluating the performance of this method using real-time PCR demonstrated that it efficiently recovered genomic DNA and total RNA. Thorough data quality assessments showed that DNA and RNA simultaneously fractionated by the SIDR method were suitable for genome and transcriptome sequencing analysis at the single-cell level. The integration of single-cell genome and transcriptome sequencing by SIDR (SIDR-seq) showed that genetic alterations, such as copy-number and single-nucleotide variations, were more accurately captured by single-cell SIDR-seq compared with conventional single-cell RNA-seq, although copy-number variations positively correlated with the corresponding gene expression levels. These results suggest that SIDR-seq is potentially a powerful tool to reveal genetic heterogeneity and phenotypic information inferred from gene expression patterns at the single-cell level.
32487174	2020	Genome biology	Systematic assessment of tissue dissociation and storage biases in single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq workflows.	BACKGROUND: Single-cell RNA sequencing has been widely adopted to estimate the cellular composition of heterogeneous tissues and obtain transcriptional profiles of individual cells. Multiple approaches for optimal sample dissociation and storage of single cells have been proposed as have single-nuclei profiling methods. What has been lacking is a systematic comparison of their relative biases and benefits. RESULTS: Here, we compare gene expression and cellular composition of single-cell suspensions prepared from adult mouse kidney using two tissue dissociation protocols. For each sample, we also compare fresh cells to cryopreserved and methanol-fixed cells. Lastly, we compare this single-cell data to that generated using three single-nucleus RNA sequencing workflows. Our data confirms prior reports that digestion on ice avoids the stress response observed with 37  degrees C dissociation. It also reveals cell types more abundant either in the cold or warm dissociations that may represent populations that require gentler or harsher conditions to be released intact. For cell storage, cryopreservation of dissociated cells results in a major loss of epithelial cell types; in contrast, methanol fixation maintains the cellular composition but suffers from ambient RNA leakage. Finally, cell type composition differences are observed between single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing libraries. In particular, we note an underrepresentation of T, B, and NK lymphocytes in the single-nucleus libraries. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic comparison of recovered cell types and their transcriptional profiles across the workflows has highlighted protocol-specific biases and thus enables researchers starting single-cell experiments to make an informed choice.
32422654	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	Disease characterization using a partial correlation-based sample-specific network.	A single-sample network (SSN) is a biological molecular network constructed from single-sample data given a reference dataset and can provide insights into the mechanisms of individual diseases and aid in the development of personalized medicine. In this study, we proposed a computational method, a partial correlation-based single-sample network (P-SSN), which not only infers a network from each single-sample data given a reference dataset but also retains the direct interactions by excluding indirect interactions (https://github.com/hyhRise/P-SSN). By applying P-SSN to analyze tumor data from the Cancer Genome Atlas and single cell data, we validated the effectiveness of P-SSN in predicting driver mutation genes (DMGs), producing network distance, identifying subtypes and further classifying single cells. In particular, P-SSN is highly effective in predicting DMGs based on single-sample data. P-SSN is also efficient for subtyping complex diseases and for clustering single cells by introducing network distance between any two samples.
31682608	2019	PLoS computational biology	Building gene regulatory networks from scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq using Linked Self Organizing Maps.	Rapid advances in single-cell assays have outpaced methods for analysis of those data types. Different single-cell assays show extensive variation in sensitivity and signal to noise levels. In particular, scATAC-seq generates extremely sparse and noisy datasets. Existing methods developed to analyze this data require cells amenable to pseudo-time analysis or require datasets with drastically different cell-types. We describe a novel approach using self-organizing maps (SOM) to link scATAC-seq regions with scRNA-seq genes that overcomes these challenges and can generate draft regulatory networks. Our SOMatic package generates chromatin and gene expression SOMs separately and combines them using a linking function. We applied SOMatic on a mouse pre-B cell differentiation time-course using controlled Ikaros over-expression to recover gene ontology enrichments, identify motifs in genomic regions showing similar single-cell profiles, and generate a gene regulatory network that both recovers known interactions and predicts new Ikaros targets during the differentiation process. The ability of linked SOMs to detect emergent properties from multiple types of highly-dimensional genomic data with very different signal properties opens new avenues for integrative analysis of heterogeneous data.
40662824	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	ARTEMIS integrates autoencoders and Schrodinger Bridges to predict continuous dynamics of gene expression, cell population, and perturbation from time-series single-cell data.	"SUMMARY: Cellular processes like development, differentiation, and disease progression are highly complex and dynamic (e.g. gene expression). These processes often undergo cell population changes driven by cell birth, proliferation, and death. Single-cell sequencing enables gene expression measurement at the cellular resolution, allowing us to decipher cellular and molecular dynamics underlying these processes. However, the high costs and destructive nature of sequencing restrict observations to snapshots of unaligned cells at discrete timepoints, limiting our understanding of these processes and complicating the reconstruction of cellular trajectories. To address this challenge, we propose ARTEMIS, a generative model integrating a variational autoencoder (VAE) with unbalanced Diffusion Schrodinger Bridge to model cellular processes by reconstructing cellular trajectories, reveal gene expression dynamics, and recover cell population changes. The VAE maps input time-series single-cell data to a continuous latent space, where trajectories are reconstructed by solving the Schrodinger bridge problem using forward-backward stochastic differential equations (SDEs). A drift function in the SDEs captures deterministic gene expression trends. An additional neural network estimates time-varying kill rates for single cells along trajectories, enabling recovery of cell population changes. Using three scRNA-seq datasets-pancreatic beta-cell differentiation, zebrafish embryogenesis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells-we demonstrate that ARTEMIS: (i) outperforms state-of-art methods to predict held-out timepoints, (ii) recovers relative cell population changes over time, and (iii) identifies ""drift"" genes driving deterministic expression trends in cell trajectories. Furthermore, in silico perturbations show that these genes influence processes like EMT. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The code for ARTEMIS: https://github.com/daifengwanglab/ARTEMIS."
32620142	2020	Genome biology	Quantile normalization of single-cell RNA-seq read counts without unique molecular identifiers.	Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) profiles gene expression of individual cells. Unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) remove duplicates in read counts resulting from polymerase chain reaction, a major source of noise. For scRNA-seq data lacking UMIs, we propose quasi-UMIs: quantile normalization of read counts to a compound Poisson distribution empirically derived from UMI datasets. When applied to ground-truth datasets having both reads and UMIs, quasi-UMI normalization has higher accuracy than competing methods. Using quasi-UMIs enables methods designed specifically for UMI data to be applied to non-UMI scRNA-seq datasets.
37169596	2023	Genome research	Efficient and accurate KIR and HLA genotyping with massively parallel sequencing data.	Killer cell immunoglobulin like receptor (KIR) genes and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes play important roles in innate and adaptive immunity. They are highly polymorphic and cannot be genotyped with standard variant calling pipelines. Compared with HLA genes, many KIR genes are similar to each other in sequences and may be absent in the chromosomes. Therefore, although many tools have been developed to genotype HLA genes using common sequencing data, none of them work for KIR genes. Even specialized KIR genotypers could not resolve all the KIR genes. Here we describe T1K, a novel computational method for the efficient and accurate inference of KIR or HLA alleles from RNA-seq, whole-genome sequencing, or whole-exome sequencing data. T1K jointly considers alleles across all genotyped genes, so it can reliably identify present genes and distinguish homologous genes, including the challenging KIR2DL5A/KIR2DL5B genes. This model also benefits HLA genotyping, where T1K achieves high accuracy in benchmarks. Moreover, T1K can call novel single-nucleotide variants and process single-cell data. Applying T1K to tumor single-cell RNA-seq data, we found that KIR2DL4 expression was enriched in tumor-specific CD8(+) T cells. T1K may open the opportunity for HLA and KIR genotyping across various sequencing applications.
33381839	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Conditional out-of-distribution generation for unpaired data using transfer VAE.	MOTIVATION: While generative models have shown great success in sampling high-dimensional samples conditional on low-dimensional descriptors (stroke thickness in MNIST, hair color in CelebA, speaker identity in WaveNet), their generation out-of-distribution poses fundamental problems due to the difficulty of learning compact joint distribution across conditions. The canonical example of the conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE), for instance, does not explicitly relate conditions during training and, hence, has no explicit incentive of learning such a compact representation. RESULTS: We overcome the limitation of the CVAE by matching distributions across conditions using maximum mean discrepancy in the decoder layer that follows the bottleneck. This introduces a strong regularization both for reconstructing samples within the same condition and for transforming samples across conditions, resulting in much improved generalization. As this amount to solving a style-transfer problem, we refer to the model as transfer VAE (trVAE). Benchmarking trVAE on high-dimensional image and single-cell RNA-seq, we demonstrate higher robustness and higher accuracy than existing approaches. We also show qualitatively improved predictions by tackling previously problematic minority classes and multiple conditions in the context of cellular perturbation response to treatment and disease based on high-dimensional single-cell gene expression data. For generic tasks, we improve Pearson correlations of high-dimensional estimated means and variances with their ground truths from 0.89 to 0.97 and 0.75 to 0.87, respectively. We further demonstrate that trVAE learns cell-type-specific responses after perturbation and improves the prediction of most cell-type-specific genes by 65%. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The trVAE implementation is available via github.com/theislab/trvae. The results of this article can be reproduced via github.com/theislab/trvae_reproducibility.
33774659	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	ShinyCell: simple and sharable visualization of single-cell gene expression data.	MOTIVATION: As the generation of complex single-cell RNA sequencing datasets becomes more commonplace it is the responsibility of researchers to provide access to these data in a way that can be easily explored and shared. Whilst it is often the case that data is deposited for future bioinformatic analysis many studies do not release their data in a way that is easy to explore by non-computational researchers. RESULTS: In order to help address this we have developed ShinyCell, an R package that converts single-cell RNA sequencing datasets into explorable and shareable interactive interfaces. These interfaces can be easily customized in order to maximize their usability and can be easily uploaded to online platforms to facilitate wider access to published data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: ShinyCell is available at https://github.com/SGDDNB/ShinyCell and https://figshare.com/projects/ShinyCell/100439. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
37697401	2023	Genome biology	The relationship between regulatory changes in cis and trans and the evolution of gene expression in humans and chimpanzees.	BACKGROUND: Comparative gene expression studies in apes are fundamentally limited by the challenges associated with sampling across different tissues. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing of embryoid bodies to collect transcriptomic data from over 70 cell types in three humans and three chimpanzees. RESULTS: We find hundreds of genes whose regulation is conserved across cell types, as well as genes whose regulation likely evolves under directional selection in one or a handful of cell types. Using embryoid bodies from a human-chimpanzee fused cell line, we also infer the proportion of inter-species regulatory differences due to changes in cis and trans elements between the species. Using the cis/trans inference and an analysis of transcription factor binding sites, we identify dozens of transcription factors whose inter-species differences in expression are affecting expression differences between humans and chimpanzees in hundreds of target genes. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we present the most comprehensive dataset of comparative gene expression from humans and chimpanzees to date, including a catalog of regulatory mechanisms associated with inter-species differences.
30664774	2019	Nature methods	A discriminative learning approach to differential expression analysis for single-cell RNA-seq.	Single-cell RNA-seq makes it possible to characterize the transcriptomes of cell types across different conditions and to identify their transcriptional signatures via differential analysis. Our method detects changes in transcript dynamics and in overall gene abundance in large numbers of cells to determine differential expression. When applied to transcript compatibility counts obtained via pseudoalignment, our approach provides a quantification-free analysis of 3' single-cell RNA-seq that can identify previously undetectable marker genes.
31133762	2019	Nature methods	Benchmarking single cell RNA-sequencing analysis pipelines using mixture control experiments.	Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has undergone rapid development in recent years, leading to an explosion in the number of tailored data analysis methods. However, the current lack of gold-standard benchmark datasets makes it difficult for researchers to systematically compare the performance of the many methods available. Here, we generated a realistic benchmark experiment that included single cells and admixtures of cells or RNA to create 'pseudo cells' from up to five distinct cancer cell lines. In total, 14 datasets were generated using both droplet and plate-based scRNA-seq protocols. We compared 3,913 combinations of data analysis methods for tasks ranging from normalization and imputation to clustering, trajectory analysis and data integration. Evaluation revealed pipelines suited to different types of data for different tasks. Our data and analysis provide a comprehensive framework for benchmarking most common scRNA-seq analysis steps.
41052214	2025	PLoS computational biology	A mixture of attention experts-embedded flow-based generative model to create synthetic cells in single-cell RNA-Seq datasets.	Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNAseq) analyses performed at the cellular level aim to understand the cellular landscape of tissue sections, offer insights into rare cell-types, and identify marker genes for annotating distinct cell types. ScRNAseq analyses are widely applied to cancer research to understand tumor heterogeneity, disease progression, and resistance to therapy. Single-cell data processing is a challenging task due to its high-dimensionality, sparsity, and having imbalanced class(cell-type) distributions. An accurate cell-type identification is highly dependent on preprocessing and quality control steps. To address these issues, generative models have been widely used in recent years. Techniques frequently used include Variational Autoencoders (VAE), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Gaussian-based methods, and, more recently, Flow-based (FB) generative models. We developed a Masked Affine Autoregressive transform-embedded FB (MAF-FB) model. Then, to improve MAF-FB further, we incorporated a mixture of experts (MOE) of attention mechanisms on top of it, resulting in our proposed MOE-FB model. We conducted a comparative analysis of fundamental generative models, aiming to serve as a preliminary guidance for developing novel automated scRNAseq data analysis systems. We performed a large-scale analysis by combiningfour datasets derived from pancreatic tissue sections and for further generalizability assessments, we employed Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC68K and PBMC3K) and Human Cell Atlas Bone Marrow (HCA-BM10K) datasets. We utilized VAE, GAN, Gaussian Copula, and Automated Cell-Type-informed Introspective Variational Autoencoder (ACTIVA), and compared them against our two novel FB models, MAF-FB and MOE-FB for ScRnaseq synthesis. To evaluate the performances of generative models, we used various discrepancy metrics and performed automated cell-type classification tasks. We also identified differentially expressed genes for each cell type, and inferred cell-cell interactions based on ligand-receptor bindings across distinct cell-type pairs. Among the generative models, FB models, especially MOE-FB, consistently outperformed others across all experimental setups in both discrepancy metrics with comparison to the baseline test set and cell-type classification tasks (with an F1-score of 0.90 precision of 0.89 and recall of 0.92 for the integrated pancreatic datasets). MOE-FB produced biologically more relevant synthetic data, and ligand-receptor-based cell-cell interactions inferred from the synthetic cells closely resemble the original data, achieving an RMSE of 0.65 against the corresponding pancreatic test set. These findings highlight the potential and promising use of FB models, especially MOE-FB, in scRNAseq analyses.
31627739	2019	Genome biology	DeepImpute: an accurate, fast, and scalable deep neural network method to impute single-cell RNA-seq data.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers new opportunities to study gene expression of tens of thousands of single cells simultaneously. We present DeepImpute, a deep neural network-based imputation algorithm that uses dropout layers and loss functions to learn patterns in the data, allowing for accurate imputation. Overall, DeepImpute yields better accuracy than other six publicly available scRNA-seq imputation methods on experimental data, as measured by the mean squared error or Pearson's correlation coefficient. DeepImpute is an accurate, fast, and scalable imputation tool that is suited to handle the ever-increasing volume of scRNA-seq data, and is freely available at https://github.com/lanagarmire/DeepImpute .
32903255	2020	PLoS computational biology	Tempora: Cell trajectory inference using time-series single-cell RNA sequencing data.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) can map cell types, states and transitions during dynamic biological processes such as tissue development and regeneration. Many trajectory inference methods have been developed to order cells by their progression through a dynamic process. However, when time series data is available, most of these methods do not consider the available time information when ordering cells and are instead designed to work only on a single scRNA-seq data snapshot. We present Tempora, a novel cell trajectory inference method that orders cells using time information from time-series scRNA-seq data. In performance comparison tests, Tempora inferred known developmental lineages from three diverse tissue development time series data sets, beating state of the art methods in accuracy and speed. Tempora works at the level of cell clusters (types) and uses biological pathway information to help identify cell type relationships. This approach increases gene expression signal from single cells, processing speed, and interpretability of the inferred trajectory. Our results demonstrate the utility of a combination of time and pathway information to supervise trajectory inference for scRNA-seq based analysis.
34131702	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	REBET: a method to determine the number of cell clusters based on batch effect removal.	In single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data analysis, a fundamental problem is to determine the number of cell clusters based on the gene expression profiles. However, the performance of current methods is still far from satisfactory, presumably due to their limitations in capturing the expression variability among cell clusters. Batch effects represent the undesired variability between data measured in different batches. When data are obtained from different labs or protocols batch effects occur. Motivated by the practice of batch effect removal, we considered cell clusters as batches. We hypothesized that the number of cell clusters (i.e. batches) could be correctly determined if the variances among clusters (i.e. batch effects) were removed. We developed a new method, namely, removal of batch effect and testing (REBET), for determining the number of cell clusters. In this method, cells are first partitioned into k clusters. Second, the batch effects among these k clusters are then removed. Third, the quality of batch effect removal is evaluated with the average range of normalized mutual information (ARNMI), which measures how uniformly the cells with batch-effects-removal are mixed. By testing a range of k values, the k value that corresponds to the lowest ARNMI is determined to be the optimal number of clusters. We compared REBET with state-of-the-art methods on 32 simulated datasets and 14 published scRNA-seq datasets. The results show that REBET can accurately and robustly estimate the number of cell clusters and outperform existing methods. Contact: H.D.L. (hongdong@csu.edu.cn) or Q.S.X. (qsxu@csu.edu.cn).

34191792	2021	PLoS computational biology	Mixture-of-Experts Variational Autoencoder for clustering and generating from similarity-based representations on single cell data.	Clustering high-dimensional data, such as images or biological measurements, is a long-standing problem and has been studied extensively. Recently, Deep Clustering has gained popularity due to its flexibility in fitting the specific peculiarities of complex data. Here we introduce the Mixture-of-Experts Similarity Variational Autoencoder (MoE-Sim-VAE), a novel generative clustering model. The model can learn multi-modal distributions of high-dimensional data and use these to generate realistic data with high efficacy and efficiency. MoE-Sim-VAE is based on a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), where the decoder consists of a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. This specific architecture allows for various modes of the data to be automatically learned by means of the experts. Additionally, we encourage the lower dimensional latent representation of our model to follow a Gaussian mixture distribution and to accurately represent the similarities between the data points. We assess the performance of our model on the MNIST benchmark data set and challenging real-world tasks of clustering mouse organs from single-cell RNA-sequencing measurements and defining cell subpopulations from mass cytometry (CyTOF) measurements on hundreds of different datasets. MoE-Sim-VAE exhibits superior clustering performance on all these tasks in comparison to the baselines as well as competitor methods.
34167583	2021	Genome biology	Optimizing expression quantitative trait locus mapping workflows for single-cell studies.	BACKGROUND: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has enabled the unbiased, high-throughput quantification of gene expression specific to cell types and states. With the cost of scRNA-seq decreasing and techniques for sample multiplexing improving, population-scale scRNA-seq, and thus single-cell expression quantitative trait locus (sc-eQTL) mapping, is increasingly feasible. Mapping of sc-eQTL provides additional resolution to study the regulatory role of common genetic variants on gene expression across a plethora of cell types and states and promises to improve our understanding of genetic regulation across tissues in both health and disease. RESULTS: While previously established methods for bulk eQTL mapping can, in principle, be applied to sc-eQTL mapping, there are a number of open questions about how best to process scRNA-seq data and adapt bulk methods to optimize sc-eQTL mapping. Here, we evaluate the role of different normalization and aggregation strategies, covariate adjustment techniques, and multiple testing correction methods to establish best practice guidelines. We use both real and simulated datasets across single-cell technologies to systematically assess the impact of these different statistical approaches. CONCLUSION: We provide recommendations for future single-cell eQTL studies that can yield up to twice as many eQTL discoveries as default approaches ported from bulk studies.
36879006	2023	Nature biotechnology	Microfluidics-free single-cell genomics with templated emulsification.	Current single-cell RNA-sequencing approaches have limitations that stem from the microfluidic devices or fluid handling steps required for sample processing. We develop a method that does not require specialized microfluidic devices, expertise or hardware. Our approach is based on particle-templated emulsification, which allows single-cell encapsulation and barcoding of cDNA in uniform droplet emulsions with only a vortexer. Particle-templated instant partition sequencing (PIP-seq) accommodates a wide range of emulsification formats, including microwell plates and large-volume conical tubes, enabling thousands of samples or millions of cells to be processed in minutes. We demonstrate that PIP-seq produces high-purity transcriptomes in mouse-human mixing studies, is compatible with multiomics measurements and can accurately characterize cell types in human breast tissue compared to a commercial microfluidic platform. Single-cell transcriptional profiling of mixed phenotype acute leukemia using PIP-seq reveals the emergence of heterogeneity within chemotherapy-resistant cell subsets that were hidden by standard immunophenotyping. PIP-seq is a simple, flexible and scalable next-generation workflow that extends single-cell sequencing to new applications.

30820578	2019	Nucleic acids research	Cell lineage inference from SNP and scRNA-Seq data.	Several recent studies focus on the inference of developmental and response trajectories from single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) data. A number of computational methods, often referred to as pseudo-time ordering, have been developed for this task. Recently, CRISPR has also been used to reconstruct lineage trees by inserting random mutations. However, both approaches suffer from drawbacks that limit their use. Here, we develop a method to detect significant, cell type specific, sequence mutations from scRNA-Seq data. We show that only a few mutations are enough for reconstructing good branching models. Integrating these mutations with expression data further improves the accuracy of the reconstructed models. As we show, the majority of mutations we identify are likely RNA editing events indicating that such information can be used to distinguish cell types.
41139927	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	scVGAMF: a novel imputation method for scRNA-seq data by integrating linear and non-linear features.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is crucial for elucidating gene expression dynamics and cellular heterogeneity at the individual cell level, thereby advancing our understanding of transcriptional regulation across distinct cell populations. However, a significant challenge in scRNA-seq data analysis is the prevalence of dropout events, which complicate downstream analyses. Most existing imputation tools either rely solely on linear assumptions or overlook the non-linear regulatory relationships embedded in the data. To address this issue, we propose single-cell variational graph autoencoder and matrix factorization (scVGAMF), a novel imputation method that integrates both linear and non-linear features. Specifically, scVGAMF first identifies highly variable genes and partitions them into groups. Cells are then clustered by applying spectral clustering to the principal component analysis results of the representative groups. Based on the resulting submatrices, along with the gene similarity and cell-cell similarity matrices, scVGAMF employs non-negative matrix factorization to extract underlying linear features while utilizing two variational graph autoencoders to capture non-linear features. A fully connected neural network then integrates these features to predict missing values. Extensive experimental evaluations on simulated dropout datasets and real scRNA-seq data demonstrate that scVGAMF outperforms existing methods in gene expression recovery, cell clustering accuracy, differential gene identification, and pseudo-trajectory analysis. Furthermore, ablation studies confirm that the integration of both linear and non-linear features significantly enhances overall data imputation performance.
26056000	2015	Genome biology	Deep sequencing reveals cell-type-specific patterns of single-cell transcriptome variation.	BACKGROUND: Differentiation of metazoan cells requires execution of different gene expression programs but recent single-cell transcriptome profiling has revealed considerable variation within cells of seeming identical phenotype. This brings into question the relationship between transcriptome states and cell phenotypes. Additionally, single-cell transcriptomics presents unique analysis challenges that need to be addressed to answer this question. RESULTS: We present high quality deep read-depth single-cell RNA sequencing for 91 cells from five mouse tissues and 18 cells from two rat tissues, along with 30 control samples of bulk RNA diluted to single-cell levels. We find that transcriptomes differ globally across tissues with regard to the number of genes expressed, the average expression patterns, and within-cell-type variation patterns. We develop methods to filter genes for reliable quantification and to calibrate biological variation. All cell types include genes with high variability in expression, in a tissue-specific manner. We also find evidence that single-cell variability of neuronal genes in mice is correlated with that in rats consistent with the hypothesis that levels of variation may be conserved. CONCLUSIONS: Single-cell RNA-sequencing data provide a unique view of transcriptome function; however, careful analysis is required in order to use single-cell RNA-sequencing measurements for this purpose. Technical variation must be considered in single-cell RNA-sequencing studies of expression variation. For a subset of genes, biological variability within each cell type appears to be regulated in order to perform dynamic functions, rather than solely molecular noise.
37462540	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	cellCounts: an R function for quantifying 10x Chromium single-cell RNA sequencing data.	SUMMARY: The 10x Genomics Chromium single-cell RNA sequencing technology is a powerful gene expression profiling platform, which is capable of profiling expression of thousands of genes in tens of thousands of cells simultaneously. This platform can produce hundreds of million reads in a single experiment, making it a very challenging task to quantify expression of genes in individual cells due to the massive data volume. Here, we present cellCounts, a new tool for efficient and accurate quantification of Chromium data. cellCounts employs the seed-and-vote strategy to align reads to a reference genome, collapses reads to Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs) and then assigns UMIs to genes based on the featureCounts program. Using both simulation and real datasets for evaluation, cellCounts was found to compare favourably to cellRanger and STARsolo. cellCounts is implemented in R, making it easily integrated with other R programs for analysing Chromium data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: cellCounts was implemented as a function in R package Rsubread that can be downloaded from http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Rsubread.html. Data and analysis code used in this study can be freely accessed via La Trobe University's Institutional Repository at https://doi.org/10.26181/21588276.

The field of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has advanced rapidly in the past decade, generating significant amounts of valuable data for researchers to study complex tumor profiles. This data is crucial for gaining innovative insights into cancer biology. CancerSCEM (https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/cancerscem) is a public resource that integrates, analyzes and visualizes scRNA-seq data related to cancer, and it provides invaluable support to numerous cancer-related studies.

We develop CellSIUS (Cell Subtype Identification from Upregulated gene Sets) to fill a methodology gap for rare cell population identification for scRNA-seq data. CellSIUS outperforms existing algorithms for specificity and selectivity for rare cell types and their transcriptomic signature identification in synthetic and complex biological data. Characterization of a human pluripotent cell differentiation protocol recapitulating deep-layer corticogenesis using CellSIUS reveals unrecognized complexity in human stem cell-derived cellular populations. CellSIUS enables identification of novel rare cell populations and their signature genes providing the means to study those populations in vitro in light of their role in health and disease.
37672035	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scAce: an adaptive embedding and clustering method for single-cell gene expression data.	MOTIVATION: Since the development of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies, clustering analysis of single-cell gene expression data has been an essential tool for distinguishing cell types and identifying novel cell types. Even though many methods have been available for scRNA-seq clustering analysis, the majority of them are constrained by the requirement on predetermined cluster numbers or the dependence on selected initial cluster assignment. RESULTS: In this article, we propose an adaptive embedding and clustering method named scAce, which constructs a variational autoencoder to simultaneously learn cell embeddings and cluster assignments. In the scAce method, we develop an adaptive cluster merging approach which achieves improved clustering results without the need to estimate the number of clusters in advance. In addition, scAce provides an option to perform clustering enhancement, which can update and enhance cluster assignments based on previous clustering results from other methods. Based on computational analysis of both simulated and real datasets, we demonstrate that scAce outperforms state-of-the-art clustering methods for scRNA-seq data, and achieves better clustering accuracy and robustness. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The scAce package is implemented in python 3.8 and is freely available from https://github.com/sldyns/scAce.
40511990	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Differentiable graph clustering with structural grouping for single-cell RNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: Clustering cells into subpopulations is one of the most crucial tasks in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis, which provides support for biological research at cellular level. With the development of graph neural networks, deep graph clustering approaches have achieved excellent performance by modeling the topological relationships between cells. However, existing approaches rely on cell node and its neighbors to obtain the cell feature representation, which ignore the graph cluster structure hidden in scRNA-seq data. Besides, how to bridge the heterogeneous gap between cell node feature and its structural information remains a highly challenging problem. RESULTS: Here, we propose a novel differentiable graph clustering with structural grouping (DGCSG) for scRNA-seq data, which incorporates graph cluster information into deep graph clustering model by designing a differentiable clustering mechanism to learn clustering-friendly representation. Firstly, an interactive module is devised to dynamically transfer node representations learned by autoencoder (AE) to graph attention autoencoder (GATE) in layer-by-layer manner. Then, to characterize graph cluster information, a differentiable clustering mechanism is proposed to transform K-way normalized cuts from a discrete optimization problem into differentiable learning objective through spectral relaxation, which jointly optimizes the GATE by allocating more attention scores to nodes in the same graph cluster. Finally, a decoupled self-supervised optimization is proposed, which guides the representation learning of AE and GATE in the interactive module. Extensive evaluations on 14 scRNA-seq benchmarks verify the superiority of DGCSG compared with state-of-the-art baselines. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The code associated with this work is available on GitHub (https://github.com/Xiaoqiang-Yan/DGCSG).
32518403	2020	Nature biotechnology	Benchmarking single-cell RNA-sequencing protocols for cell atlas projects.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is the leading technique for characterizing the transcriptomes of individual cells in a sample. The latest protocols are scalable to thousands of cells and are being used to compile cell atlases of tissues, organs and organisms. However, the protocols differ substantially with respect to their RNA capture efficiency, bias, scale and costs, and their relative advantages for different applications are unclear. In the present study, we generated benchmark datasets to systematically evaluate protocols in terms of their power to comprehensively describe cell types and states. We performed a multicenter study comparing 13 commonly used scRNA-seq and single-nucleus RNA-seq protocols applied to a heterogeneous reference sample resource. Comparative analysis revealed marked differences in protocol performance. The protocols differed in library complexity and their ability to detect cell-type markers, impacting their predictive value and suitability for integration into reference cell atlases. These results provide guidance both for individual researchers and for consortium projects such as the Human Cell Atlas.
35394015	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scGraph: a graph neural network-based approach to automatically identify cell types.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell technologies play a crucial role in revolutionizing biological research over the past decade, which strengthens our understanding in cell differentiation, development and regulation from a single-cell level perspective. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is one of the most common single cell technologies, which enables probing transcriptional states in thousands of cells in one experiment. Identification of cell types from scRNA-seq measurements is a fundamental and crucial question to answer. Most previous studies directly take gene expression as input while ignoring the comprehensive gene-gene interactions. RESULTS: We propose scGraph, an automatic cell identification algorithm leveraging gene interaction relationships to enhance the performance of the cell-type identification. scGraph is based on a graph neural network to aggregate the information of interacting genes. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate that scGraph is accurate and outperforms eight comparison methods in the task of cell-type identification. Moreover, scGraph automatically learns the gene interaction relationships from biological data and the pathway enrichment analysis shows consistent findings with previous analysis, providing insights on the analysis of regulatory mechanism.

36018232	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	FastMix: a versatile data integration pipeline for cell type-specific biomarker inference.	MOTIVATION: Flow cytometry (FCM) and transcription profiling are the two widely used assays in translational immunology research. However, there is no data integration pipeline for analyzing these two types of assays together with experiment variables for biomarker inference. Current FCM data analysis mainly relies on subjective manual gating analysis, which is difficult to be directly integrated with other automated computational methods. Existing deconvolutional analysis of bulk transcriptomics relies on predefined marker genes in the transcriptomics data, which are unavailable for novel cell types and does not utilize the FCM data that provide canonical phenotypic definitions of the cell types. RESULTS: We developed a novel analytics pipeline-FastMix-for computational immunology, which integrates flow cytometry, bulk transcriptomics and clinical covariates for identifying cell type-specific gene expression signatures and biomarker genes. FastMix addresses the 'large p, small n' problem in the gene expression and flow cytometry integration analysis via a linear mixed effects model (LMER) for both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Its novel moment-based estimator not only reduces bias in parameter estimation but also is more efficient than iterative optimization. The FastMix pipeline also includes a cutting-edge flow cytometry data analysis method-DAFi-for identifying cell populations of interest and their characteristics. Simulation studies showed that FastMix produced smaller type I/II errors than competing methods. Validation using real data of two vaccine studies showed that FastMix identified a consistent set of signature genes as in independent single-cell RNA-seq analysis, producing additional interesting findings. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Source code of FastMix is publicly available at https://github.com/terrysun0302/FastMix.

38243719	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scCancer2: data-driven in-depth annotations of the tumor microenvironment at single-level resolution.	SUMMARY: Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) is a powerful technique for decoding the complex cellular compositions in the tumor microenvironment (TME). As previous studies have defined many meaningful cell subtypes in several tumor types, there is a great need to computationally transfer these labels to new datasets. Also, different studies used different approaches or criteria to define the cell subtypes for the same major cell lineages. The relationships between the cell subtypes defined in different studies should be carefully evaluated. In this updated package scCancer2, designed for integrative tumor scRNA-seq data analysis, we developed a supervised machine learning framework to annotate TME cells with annotated cell subtypes from 15 scRNA-seq datasets with 594 samples in total. Based on the trained classifiers, we quantitatively constructed the similarity maps between the cell subtypes defined in different references by testing on all the 15 datasets. Secondly, to improve the identification of malignant cells, we designed a classifier by integrating large-scale pan-cancer TCGA bulk gene expression datasets and scRNA-seq datasets (10 cancer types, 175 samples, 663 857 cells). This classifier shows robust performances when no internal confidential reference cells are available. Thirdly, scCancer2 integrated a module to process the spatial transcriptomic data and analyze the spatial features of TME. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The package and user documentation are available at http://lifeome.net/software/sccancer2/ and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10477296.
32073612	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	CMF-Impute: an accurate imputation tool for single-cell RNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology provides a powerful tool for investigating cell heterogeneity and cell subpopulations by allowing the quantification of gene expression at single-cell level. However, scRNA-seq data analysis remains challenging because of various technical noises such as dropout events (i.e. excessive zero counts in the expression matrix). RESULTS: By taking consideration of the association among cells and genes, we propose a novel collaborative matrix factorization-based method called CMF-Impute to impute the dropout entries of a given scRNA-seq expression matrix. We test CMF-Impute and compare it with the other five state-of-the-art methods on six popular real scRNA-seq datasets of various sizes and three simulated datasets. For simulated datasets, CMF-Impute outperforms other methods in imputing the closest dropouts to the original expression values as evaluated by both the sum of squared error and Pearson correlation coefficient. For real datasets, CMF-Impute achieves the most accurate cell classification results in spite of the choice of different clustering methods like SC3 or T-SNE followed by K-means as evaluated by both adjusted rand index and normalized mutual information. Finally, we demonstrate that CMF-Impute is powerful in reconstructing cell-to-cell and gene-to-gene correlation, and in inferring cell lineage trajectories. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: CMF-Impute is written as a Matlab package which is available at https://github.com/xujunlin123/CMFImpute.git. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
29394315	2019	Briefings in bioinformatics	How to design a single-cell RNA-sequencing experiment: pitfalls, challenges and perspectives.	The sequencing of the transcriptome of single cells, or single-cell RNA-sequencing, has now become the dominant technology for the identification of novel cell types in heterogeneous cell populations or for the study of stochastic gene expression. In recent years, various experimental methods and computational tools for analysing single-cell RNA-sequencing data have been proposed. However, most of them are tailored to different experimental designs or biological questions, and in many cases, their performance has not been benchmarked yet, thus increasing the difficulty for a researcher to choose the optimal single-cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiment and analysis workflow. In this review, we aim to provide an overview of the current available experimental and computational methods developed to handle single-cell RNA-sequencing data and, based on their peculiarities, we suggest possible analysis frameworks depending on specific experimental designs. Together, we propose an evaluation of challenges and open questions and future perspectives in the field. In particular, we go through the different steps of scRNA-seq experimental protocols such as cell isolation, messenger RNA capture, reverse transcription, amplification and use of quantitative standards such as spike-ins and Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs). We then analyse the current methodological challenges related to preprocessing, alignment, quantification, normalization, batch effect correction and methods to control for confounding effects.
39530237	2025	Nucleic acids research	PolyASite v3.0: a multi-species atlas of polyadenylation sites inferred from single-cell RNA-sequencing data.	The broadly used 10X Genomics technology for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) captures RNA 3' ends. Thus, some reads contain part of the non-templated polyadenosine tails, providing direct evidence for the sites of 3' end cleavage and polyadenylation on the respective RNAs. Taking advantage of this property, we recently developed the SCINPAS workflow to infer polyadenylation sites (PASs) from scRNA-seq data. Here, we used this workflow to construct version 3.0 (v3.0, https://polyasite.unibas.ch/) of the PolyASite Atlas from a big compendium of publicly available human, mouse and worm scRNA-seq datasets obtained from healthy tissues. As the resolution of scRNA-seq was too low for robust detection of cell-level differences in PAS usage, we aggregated samples based on their tissue-of-origin to construct tissue-level catalogs of PASs. These provide qualitatively new information about PAS usage, in comparison to the previous PAS catalogs that were based on bulk 3' end sequencing experiments primarily in cell lines. In the new version, we document stringency levels associated with each PAS so that users can balance sensitivity and specificity in their analysis. We also upgraded the integration with the UCSC Genome Browser and developed track hubs conveniently displaying pooled and tissue-specific expression of PASs.

40829806	2025	Nucleic acids research	Inferring causal trajectories from spatial transcriptomics using CASCAT.	Spatial trajectory inference models cell differentiation and state dynamics within tissues by integrating spatial information. Existing spatial trajectory inference methods depend on similarity-based cell graphs constructed from spatial proximity, with less attention to the Markovian property in cell state transitions. In this study, we introduce CASCAT, a tree-shaped structural causal model with the Markovian property integrated to infer a unique cell differentiation trajectory, addressing challenges posed by Markov equivalence in high-dimensional and nonlinear data. CASCAT outperforms six state-of-the-art single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)-oriented methods across 10 simulated and seven real scRNA-seq datasets and exceeds three leading spatial trajectory inference methods on 13 real spatial transcriptomics datasets from multiple platforms. In the mouse inner olfactory bulb, CASCAT accurately differentiates maturation trajectories among specific cell types and reveals the Wnt signaling pathway by removing conditionally independent connections. Furthermore, by modeling post-treatment cancer cell trajectories through in silico simulations, CASCAT predicts drug responses in oral squamous cell carcinoma with a 6.8% increase in precision compared to RNA velocity-based methods, contributing to advances in computer-assisted drug discovery.
37582761	2023	Genome biology	BamQuery: a proteogenomic tool to explore the immunopeptidome and prioritize actionable tumor antigens.	MHC-I-associated peptides deriving from non-coding genomic regions and mutations can generate tumor-specific antigens, including neoantigens. Quantifying tumor-specific antigens' RNA expression in malignant and benign tissues is critical for discriminating actionable targets. We present BamQuery, a tool attributing an exhaustive RNA expression to MHC-I-associated peptides of any origin from bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing data. We show that many cryptic and mutated tumor-specific antigens can derive from multiple discrete genomic regions, abundantly expressed in normal tissues. BamQuery can also be used to predict MHC-I-associated peptides immunogenicity and identify actionable tumor-specific antigens de novo.
39987461	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	cfDiffusion: diffusion-based efficient generation of high quality scRNA-seq data with classifier-free guidance.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology provides a powerful means to measure gene expression at the individual cell level, thereby uncovering the intricate cellular heterogeneity that underlies various biological processes, including embryonic development, tumor metastasis, and microbial reproduction. However, the variable amounts of data generated across different cell types within tissues can compromise the accuracy of downstream analyses. Traditional approaches for generating scRNA-seq simulation data often rely on predefined data distributions, which can negatively impact the quality of the simulated data. Furthermore, these methods typically focus on simulating single-attribute cells, necessitating substantial additional data for the simulation of multi-attribute cells, which can lead to increased training times. To address these limitations, we propose cfDiffusion, a novel method grounded in diffusion models that incorporates Classifier-Free Guidance and a high-level feature caching mechanism. By leveraging Classifier-Free Guidance, cfDiffusion significantly reduces the training costs associated with model development compared to traditional Classifier Guidance methods. The integration of a caching mechanism further enhances efficiency by shortening inference times. While the inference duration of cfDiffusion remains longer than that of scDiffusion, it exhibits superior expressiveness and efficiency in generating multi-attribute single-cell data. Evaluated across datasets from multiple sequencing platforms, cfDiffusion consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models across various performance metrics. Additionally, cfDiffusion enables the simulation of single-cell data along a pseudo-time scale, facilitating advanced analyses such as tracking cell differentiation, investigating intercellular communication, and elucidating cellular heterogeneity.
39470723	2025	Nucleic acids research	LnCeCell 2.0: an updated resource for lncRNA-associated ceRNA networks and web tools based on single-cell and spatial transcriptomics sequencing data.	We describe LnCeCell 2.0 (http://bio-bigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/LnCeCell), an updated resource for lncRNA-associated competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks and web tools based on single-cell and spatial transcriptomics sequencing (stRNA-seq) data. We have updated the LnCeCell 2.0 database with significantly expanded data and improved features, including (i) 257 single-cell RNA sequencing and stRNA-seq datasets across 86 diseases/phenotypes and 80 human normal tissues, (ii) 836 581 cell-specific and spatial spot-specific ceRNA interactions and functional networks for 1 002 988 cells and 367 971 spatial spots, (iii) 15 489 experimentally supported lncRNA biomarkers related to disease pathology, diagnosis and treatment, (iv) detailed annotation of cell type, cell state, subcellular and extracellular locations of ceRNAs through manual curation and (v) ceRNA expression profiles and follow-up clinical information of 20 326 cancer patients. Further, a panel of 24 flexible tools (including 8 comprehensive and 16 mini-analysis tools) was developed to investigate ceRNA-regulated mechanisms at single-cell/spot resolution. The CeCellTraject tool, for example, illustrates the detailed ceRNA distribution of different cell populations and explores the dynamic change of the ceRNA network along the developmental trajectory. LnCeCell 2.0 will facilitate the study of fine-tuned lncRNA-ceRNA networks with single-cell and spatial spot resolution, helping us to understand the regulatory mechanisms behind complex microbial ecosystems.
31271412	2020	Briefings in bioinformatics	Clustering and classification methods for single-cell RNA-sequencing data.	Appropriate ways to measure the similarity between single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data are ubiquitous in bioinformatics, but using single clustering or classification methods to process scRNA-seq data is generally difficult. This has led to the emergence of integrated methods and tools that aim to automatically process specific problems associated with scRNA-seq data. These approaches have attracted a lot of interest in bioinformatics and related fields. In this paper, we systematically review the integrated methods and tools, highlighting the pros and cons of each approach. We not only pay particular attention to clustering and classification methods but also discuss methods that have emerged recently as powerful alternatives, including nonlinear and linear methods and descending dimension methods. Finally, we focus on clustering and classification methods for scRNA-seq data, in particular, integrated methods, and provide a comprehensive description of scRNA-seq data and download URLs.
37200157	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	CIForm as a Transformer-based model for cell-type annotation of large-scale single-cell RNA-seq data.	Single-cell omics technologies have made it possible to analyze the individual cells within a biological sample, providing a more detailed understanding of biological systems. Accurately determining the cell type of each cell is a crucial goal in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) analysis. Apart from overcoming the batch effects arising from various factors, single-cell annotation methods also face the challenge of effectively processing large-scale datasets. With the availability of an increase in the scRNA-seq datasets, integrating multiple datasets and addressing batch effects originating from diverse sources are also challenges in cell-type annotation. In this work, to overcome the challenges, we developed a supervised method called CIForm based on the Transformer for cell-type annotation of large-scale scRNA-seq data. To assess the effectiveness and robustness of CIForm, we have compared it with some leading tools on benchmark datasets. Through the systematic comparisons under various cell-type annotation scenarios, we exhibit that the effectiveness of CIForm is particularly pronounced in cell-type annotation. The source code and data are available at https://github.com/zhanglab-wbgcas/CIForm.
40622484	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	scAGCI: an anchor graph-based method for cell clustering from integrated scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data.	Single-cell multi-omics clustering confronts noise and heterogeneity barriers. Current multi-view anchor graph approaches, though successful in noise reduction, inadequately model higher order feature interactions. To address this issue, we propose scAGCI, a cell clustering method based on anchor graphs that integrates both scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data. Our method captures specific and shared anchor graphs representing the properties of omics data in the process of dynamic anchor unification, and mines high-order shared information to complete the omics representation. Subsequently, clustering results are obtained by integrating the specific and shared omics representation. Benchmarking against 13 state-of-the-art methods confirms scAGCI's superior clustering performance and computational efficiency in cell-type identification and subtype resolution. The method preserves biologically meaningful omics patterns, as evidenced by marker gene enrichment and functional analyses, establishing it as a robust tool for elucidating cellular heterogeneity in single-cell multi-omics data.
31197307	2019	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	DECENT: differential expression with capture efficiency adjustmeNT for single-cell RNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: Dropout is a common phenomenon in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data, and when left unaddressed it affects the validity of the statistical analyses. Despite this, few current methods for differential expression (DE) analysis of scRNA-seq data explicitly model the process that gives rise to the dropout events. We develop DECENT, a method for DE analysis of scRNA-seq data that explicitly and accurately models the molecule capture process in scRNA-seq experiments. RESULTS: We show that DECENT demonstrates improved DE performance over existing DE methods that do not explicitly model dropout. This improvement is consistently observed across several public scRNA-seq datasets generated using different technological platforms. The gain in improvement is especially large when the capture process is overdispersed. DECENT maintains type I error well while achieving better sensitivity. Its performance without spike-ins is almost as good as when spike-ins are used to calibrate the capture model. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The method is implemented as a publicly available R package available from https://github.com/cz-ye/DECENT. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
41034048	2025	Genome research	Highly accurate reference and method selection for universal cross-data set cell type annotation with CAMUS.	Cell type annotation is a critical and essential task in single-cell data analysis. Various reference-based methods have provided rapid annotation for diverse single-cell data. However, selection of the optimal references and methods is often overlooked. To this end, we present a cross-data set cell type annotation methodology with a universal reference data and method selection strategy (CAMUS) to achieve highly accurate and efficient annotations. We demonstrate the advantages of CAMUS by conducting comprehensive analyses on 672 pairs of cross-species scRNA-seq data sets. The annotation results with references selected by CAMUS achieves substantial accuracy gains (25.0%-124.7%) over random selection strategies across five reference-based methods. CAMUS achieves high accuracy in choosing the best reference-method pair among 3360 pairs (49.1%). Moreover, CAMUS shows high accuracy in selecting the best methods on the 80 scST data sets (82.5%) and five scATAC-seq data sets (100.0%), illustrating its universal applicability. In addition, we utilize the CAMUS score with other metrics to predict the annotation accuracy, providing direct guidance on whether to accept current annotation results.
34255817	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	HieRFIT: a hierarchical cell type classification tool for projections from complex single-cell atlas datasets.	MOTIVATION: The emergence of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has led to an explosion in novel methods to study biological variation among individual cells, and to classify cells into functional and biologically meaningful categories. RESULTS: Here, we present a new cell type projection tool, Hierarchical Random Forest for Information Transfer (HieRFIT), based on hierarchical random forests. HieRFIT uses a priori information about cell type relationships to improve classification accuracy, taking as input a hierarchical tree structure representing the class relationships, along with the reference data. We use an ensemble approach combining multiple random forest models, organized in a hierarchical decision tree structure. We show that our hierarchical classification approach improves accuracy and reduces incorrect predictions especially for inter-dataset tasks which reflect real-life applications. We use a scoring scheme that adjusts probability distributions for candidate class labels and resolves uncertainties while avoiding the assignment of cells to incorrect types by labeling cells at internal nodes of the hierarchy when necessary. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: HieRFIT is implemented as an R package, and it is available at (https://github.com/yasinkaymaz/HieRFIT/releases/tag/v1.0.0). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
31510695	2019	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scOrange-a tool for hands-on training of concepts from single-cell data analytics.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing allows us to simultaneously profile the transcriptomes of thousands of cells and to indulge in exploring cell diversity, development and discovery of new molecular mechanisms. Analysis of scRNA data involves a combination of non-trivial steps from statistics, data visualization, bioinformatics and machine learning. Training molecular biologists in single-cell data analysis and empowering them to review and analyze their data can be challenging, both because of the complexity of the methods and the steep learning curve. RESULTS: We propose a workshop-style training in single-cell data analytics that relies on an explorative data analysis toolbox and a hands-on teaching style. The training relies on scOrange, a newly developed extension of a data mining framework that features workflow design through visual programming and interactive visualizations. Workshops with scOrange can proceed much faster than similar training methods that rely on computer programming and analysis through scripting in R or Python, allowing the trainer to cover more ground in the same time-frame. We here review the design principles of the scOrange toolbox that support such workshops and propose a syllabus for the course. We also provide examples of data analysis workflows that instructors can use during the training. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: scOrange is an open-source software. The software, documentation and an emerging set of educational videos are available at http://singlecell.biolab.si.
32633778	2020	Nucleic acids research	Variance-adjusted Mahalanobis (VAM): a fast and accurate method for cell-specific gene set scoring.	Statistical analysis of single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data is hindered by high levels of technical noise and inflated zero counts. One promising approach for addressing these challenges is gene set testing, or pathway analysis, which can mitigate sparsity and noise, and improve interpretation and power, by aggregating expression data to the pathway level. Unfortunately, methods optimized for bulk transcriptomics perform poorly on scRNA-seq data and progress on single cell-specific techniques has been limited. Importantly, no existing methods support cell-level gene set inference. To address this challenge, we developed a new gene set testing method, Variance-adjusted Mahalanobis (VAM), that integrates with the Seurat framework and can accommodate the technical noise, sparsity and large sample sizes characteristic of scRNA-seq data. The VAM method computes cell-specific pathway scores to transform a cell-by-gene matrix into a cell-by-pathway matrix that can be used for both data visualization and statistical enrichment analysis. Because the distribution of these scores under the null of uncorrelated technical noise has an accurate gamma approximation, both population and cell-level inference is supported. As demonstrated using simulated and real scRNA-seq data, the VAM method provides superior classification accuracy at a lower computation cost relative to existing single sample gene set testing approaches.
37862234	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	DELFOS-drug efficacy leveraging forked and specialized networks-benchmarking scRNA-seq data in multi-omics-based prediction of cancer sensitivity.	MOTIVATION: Cancer is currently one of the most notorious diseases, with over 1 million deaths in the European Union alone in 2022. As each tumor can be composed of diverse cell types with distinct genotypes, cancer cells can acquire resistance to different compounds. Moreover, anticancer drugs can display severe side effects, compromising patient well-being. Therefore, novel strategies for identifying the optimal set of compounds to treat each tumor have become an important research topic in recent decades. RESULTS: To address this challenge, we developed a novel drug response prediction algorithm called Drug Efficacy Leveraging Forked and Specialized networks (DELFOS). Our model learns from multi-omics data from over 65 cancer cell lines, as well as structural data from over 200 compounds, for the prediction of drug sensitivity. We also evaluated the benefits of incorporating single-cell expression data to predict drug response. DELFOS was validated using datasets with unseen cell lines or drugs and compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms, achieving a high prediction performance on several correlation and error metrics. Overall, DELFOS can effectively leverage multi-omics data for the prediction of drug responses in thousands of drug-cell line pairs. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The DELFOS pipeline and associated data are available at github.com/MoreiraLAB/delfos.
35876552	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Detecting retinal neural and stromal cell classes and ganglion cell subtypes based on transcriptome data with deep transfer learning.	MOTIVATION: To develop and assess the accuracy of deep learning models that identify different retinal cell types, as well as different retinal ganglion cell (RGC) subtypes, based on patterns of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in multiple datasets. RESULTS: Deep domain adaptation models were developed and tested using three different datasets. The first dataset included 44 808 single retinal cells from mice (39 cell types) with 24 658 genes, the second dataset included 6225 single RGCs from mice (41 subtypes) with 13 616 genes and the third dataset included 35 699 single RGCs from mice (45 subtypes) with 18 222 genes. We used four loss functions in the learning process to align the source and target distributions, reduce misclassification errors and maximize robustness. Models were evaluated based on classification accuracy and confusion matrix. The accuracy of the model for correctly classifying 39 different retinal cell types in the first dataset was  approximately 92%. Accuracy in the second and third datasets reached  approximately 97% and 97% in correctly classifying 40 and 45 different RGCs subtypes, respectively. Across a range of seven different batches in the first dataset, the accuracy of the lead model ranged from 74% to nearly 100%. The lead model provided high accuracy in identifying retinal cell types and RGC subtypes based on scRNA-seq data. The performance was reasonable based on data from different batches as well. The validated model could be readily applied to scRNA-seq data to identify different retinal cell types and subtypes. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The code and datasets are available on https://github.com/DM2LL/Detecting-Retinal-Cell-Classes-and-Ganglion-Cell-Subtypes. We have also added the class labels of all samples to the datasets. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
37930842	2024	Nucleic acids research	SCAN: Spatiotemporal Cloud Atlas for Neural cells.	The nervous system is one of the most complicated and enigmatic systems within the animal kingdom. Recently, the emergence and development of spatial transcriptomics (ST) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have provided an unprecedented ability to systematically decipher the cellular heterogeneity and spatial locations of the nervous system from multiple unbiased aspects. However, efficiently integrating, presenting and analyzing massive multiomic data remains a huge challenge. Here, we manually collected and comprehensively analyzed high-quality scRNA-seq and ST data from the nervous system, covering 10 679 684 cells. In addition, multi-omic datasets from more than 900 species were included for extensive data mining from an evolutionary perspective. Furthermore, over 100 neurological diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Down syndrome) were systematically analyzed for high-throughput screening of putative biomarkers. Differential expression patterns across developmental time points, cell types and ST spots were discerned and subsequently subjected to extensive interpretation. To provide researchers with efficient data exploration, we created a new database with interactive interfaces and integrated functions called the Spatiotemporal Cloud Atlas for Neural cells (SCAN), freely accessible at http://47.98.139.124:8799 or http://scanatlas.net. SCAN will benefit the neuroscience research community to better exploit the spatiotemporal atlas of the neural system and promote the development of diagnostic strategies for various neurological disorders.
30535348	2019	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	DensityPath: an algorithm to visualize and reconstruct cell state-transition path on density landscape for single-cell RNA sequencing data.	MOTIVATION: Visualizing and reconstructing cell developmental trajectories intrinsically embedded in high-dimensional expression profiles of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) snapshot data are computationally intriguing, but challenging. RESULTS: We propose DensityPath, an algorithm allowing (i) visualization of the intrinsic structure of scRNA-seq data on an embedded 2-d space and (ii) reconstruction of an optimal cell state-transition path on the density landscape. DensityPath powerfully handles high dimensionality and heterogeneity of scRNA-seq data by (i) revealing the intrinsic structures of data, while adopting a non-linear dimension reduction algorithm, termed elastic embedding, which can preserve both local and global structures of the data; and (ii) extracting the topological features of high-density, level-set clusters from a single-cell multimodal density landscape of transcriptional heterogeneity, as the representative cell states. DensityPath reconstructs the optimal cell state-transition path by finding the geodesic minimum spanning tree of representative cell states on the density landscape, establishing a least action path with the minimum-transition-energy of cell fate decisions. We demonstrate that DensityPath can ably reconstruct complex trajectories of cell development, e.g. those with multiple bifurcating and trifurcating branches, while maintaining computational efficiency. Moreover, DensityPath has high accuracy for pseudotime calculation and branch assignment on real scRNA-seq, as well as simulated datasets. DensityPath is robust to parameter choices, as well as permutations of data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: DensityPath software is available at https://github.com/ucasdp/DensityPath. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
36070863	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	Boosting single-cell gene regulatory network reconstruction via bulk-cell transcriptomic data.	Computational recovery of gene regulatory network (GRN) has recently undergone a great shift from bulk-cell towards designing algorithms targeting single-cell data. In this work, we investigate whether the widely available bulk-cell data could be leveraged to assist the GRN predictions for single cells. We infer cell-type-specific GRNs from both the single-cell RNA sequencing data and the generic GRN derived from the bulk cells by constructing a weakly supervised learning framework based on the axial transformer. We verify our assumption that the bulk-cell transcriptomic data are a valuable resource, which could improve the prediction of single-cell GRN by conducting extensive experiments. Our GRN-transformer achieves the state-of-the-art prediction accuracy in comparison to existing supervised and unsupervised approaches. In addition, we show that our method can identify important transcription factors and potential regulations for Alzheimer's disease risk genes by using the predicted GRN. Availability: The implementation of GRN-transformer is available at https://github.com/HantaoShu/GRN-Transformer.
39794120	2025	Genome research	Single-cell Rapid Capture Hybridization sequencing reliably detects isoform usage and coding mutations in targeted genes.	Single-cell long-read sequencing has transformed our understanding of isoform usage and the mutation heterogeneity between cells. Despite unbiased in-depth analysis, the low sequencing throughput often results in insufficient read coverage, thereby limiting our ability to perform mutation calling for specific genes. Here, we developed a single-cell Rapid Capture Hybridization sequencing (scRaCH-seq) method that demonstrates high specificity and efficiency in capturing targeted transcripts using long-read sequencing, allowing an in-depth analysis of mutation status and transcript usage for genes of interest. The method includes creating a probe panel for transcript capture, using barcoded primers for pooling and efficient sequencing via Oxford Nanopore Technologies platforms. scRaCH-seq is applicable to stored and indexed single-cell cDNA, which allows analysis to be combined with existing short-read RNA-seq data sets. In our investigation of BTK and SF3B1 genes in samples from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), we detect SF3B1 isoforms and mutations with high sensitivity. Integration with short-read single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data reveals significant gene expression differences in SF3B1-mutated CLL cells, although it does not impact the sensitivity of the anticancer drug venetoclax. scRaCH-seq's capability to study long-read transcripts of multiple genes makes it a powerful tool for single-cell genomics.

36681937	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Hierarchical cell-type identifier accurately distinguishes immune-cell subtypes enabling precise profiling of tissue microenvironment with single-cell RNA-sequencing.	Single-cell RNA-seq enabled in-depth study on tissue micro-environment and immune-profiling, where a crucial step is to annotate cell identity. Immune cells play key roles in many diseases, whereas their activities are hard to track due to their diverse and highly variable nature. Existing cell-type identifiers had limited performance for this purpose. We present HiCAT, a hierarchical, marker-based cell-type identifier utilising gene set analysis for statistical scoring for given markers. It features successive identification of major-type, minor-type and subsets utilising subset markers structured in a three-level taxonomy tree. Comparison with manual annotation and pairwise match test showed HiCAT outperforms others in major- and minor-type identification. For subsets, we qualitatively evaluated the marker expression profile demonstrating that HiCAT provide the clearest immune-cell landscape. HiCAT was also used for immune-cell profiling in ulcerative colitis and discovered distinct features of the disease in macrophage and T-cell subsets that could not be identified previously.
34028547	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Interfacing Seurat with the R tidy universe.	MOTIVATION: Seurat is one of the most popular software suites for the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data. Considering the popularity of the tidyverse ecosystem, which offers a large set of data display, query, manipulation, integration and visualization utilities, a great opportunity exists to interface the Seurat object with the tidyverse. This interface gives the large data science community of tidyverse users the possibility to operate with familiar grammar.

38555470	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	scNovel: a scalable deep learning-based network for novel rare cell discovery in single-cell transcriptomics.	Single-cell RNA sequencing has achieved massive success in biological research fields. Discovering novel cell types from single-cell transcriptomics has been demonstrated to be essential in the field of biomedicine, yet is time-consuming and needs prior knowledge. With the unprecedented boom in cell atlases, auto-annotation tools have become more prevalent due to their speed, accuracy and user-friendly features. However, existing tools have mostly focused on general cell-type annotation and have not adequately addressed the challenge of discovering novel rare cell types. In this work, we introduce scNovel, a powerful deep learning-based neural network that specifically focuses on novel rare cell discovery. By testing our model on diverse datasets with different scales, protocols and degrees of imbalance, we demonstrate that scNovel significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art novel cell detection models, reaching the most AUROC performance(the only one method whose averaged AUROC results are above 94%, up to 16.26% more comparing to the second-best method). We validate scNovel's performance on a million-scale dataset to illustrate the scalability of scNovel further. Applying scNovel on a clinical COVID-19 dataset, three potential novel subtypes of Macrophages are identified, where the COVID-related differential genes are also detected to have consistent expression patterns through deeper analysis. We believe that our proposed pipeline will be an important tool for high-throughput clinical data in a wide range of applications.
36631981	2023	Nucleic acids research	MARVEL: an integrated alternative splicing analysis platform for single-cell RNA sequencing data.	Alternative splicing is an important source of heterogeneity underlying gene expression between individual cells but remains an understudied area due to the paucity of computational tools to analyze splicing dynamics at single-cell resolution. Here, we present MARVEL, a comprehensive R package for single-cell splicing analysis applicable to RNA sequencing generated from the plate- and droplet-based methods. We performed extensive benchmarking of MARVEL against available tools and demonstrated its utility by analyzing multiple publicly available datasets in diverse cell types, including in disease. MARVEL enables systematic and integrated splicing and gene expression analysis of single cells to characterize the splicing landscape and reveal biological insights.
40696440	2025	Genome biology	FedscGen: privacy-preserving federated batch effect correction of single-cell RNA sequencing data.	Single-cell RNA-seq data from clinical samples often suffer from batch effects, but data sharing is limited due to genomic privacy concerns. We present FedscGen, a privacy-preserving communication-efficient federated method built upon the scGen model, enhanced with secure multiparty computation. FedscGen supports federated training and batch effect correction workflows, including the integration of new studies. We benchmark FedscGen across diverse datasets, showing competitive performance-matching scGen on key metrics like NMI, GC, ILF1, ASW_C, kBET, and EBM on the Human Pancreas dataset. Published as a FeatureCloud app, FedscGen enables secure, real-world collaboration for scRNA-seq batch effect correction.
35277707	2022	Nature methods	Alevin-fry unlocks rapid, accurate and memory-frugal quantification of single-cell RNA-seq data.	The rapid growth of high-throughput single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq) technologies has produced a wealth of data over the past few years. The size, volume and distinctive characteristics of these data necessitate the development of new computational methods to accurately and efficiently quantify sc/snRNA-seq data into count matrices that constitute the input to downstream analyses. We introduce the alevin-fry framework for quantifying sc/snRNA-seq data. In addition to being faster and more memory frugal than other accurate quantification approaches, alevin-fry ameliorates the memory scalability and false-positive expression issues that are exhibited by other lightweight tools. We demonstrate how alevin-fry can be effectively used to quantify sc/snRNA-seq data, and also how the spliced and unspliced molecule quantification required as input for RNA velocity analyses can be seamlessly extracted from the same preprocessed data used to generate normal gene expression count matrices.
38641842	2024	Genome biology	Single Cell Atlas: a single-cell multi-omics human cell encyclopedia.	Single-cell sequencing datasets are key in biology and medicine for unraveling insights into heterogeneous cell populations with unprecedented resolution. Here, we construct a single-cell multi-omics map of human tissues through in-depth characterizations of datasets from five single-cell omics, spatial transcriptomics, and two bulk omics across 125 healthy adult and fetal tissues. We construct its complement web-based platform, the Single Cell Atlas (SCA, www.singlecellatlas.org ), to enable vast interactive data exploration of deep multi-omics signatures across human fetal and adult tissues. The atlas resources and database queries aspire to serve as a one-stop, comprehensive, and time-effective resource for various omics studies.
35176023	2022	PLoS computational biology	Regulatory network-based imputation of dropouts in single-cell RNA sequencing data.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) methods are typically unable to quantify the expression levels of all genes in a cell, creating a need for the computational prediction of missing values ('dropout imputation'). Most existing dropout imputation methods are limited in the sense that they exclusively use the scRNA-seq dataset at hand and do not exploit external gene-gene relationship information. Further, it is unknown if all genes equally benefit from imputation or which imputation method works best for a given gene. Here, we show that a transcriptional regulatory network learned from external, independent gene expression data improves dropout imputation. Using a variety of human scRNA-seq datasets we demonstrate that our network-based approach outperforms published state-of-the-art methods. The network-based approach performs particularly well for lowly expressed genes, including cell-type-specific transcriptional regulators. Further, the cell-to-cell variation of 11.3% to 48.8% of the genes could not be adequately imputed by any of the methods that we tested. In those cases gene expression levels were best predicted by the mean expression across all cells, i.e. assuming no measurable expression variation between cells. These findings suggest that different imputation methods are optimal for different genes. We thus implemented an R-package called ADImpute (available via Bioconductor https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ADImpute.html) that automatically determines the best imputation method for each gene in a dataset. Our work represents a paradigm shift by demonstrating that there is no single best imputation method. Instead, we propose that imputation should maximally exploit external information and be adapted to gene-specific features, such as expression level and expression variation across cells.
37524958	2024	Nature biotechnology	PhyloVelo enhances transcriptomic velocity field mapping using monotonically expressed genes.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful approach for studying cellular differentiation, but accurately tracking cell fate transitions can be challenging, especially in disease conditions. Here we introduce PhyloVelo, a computational framework that estimates the velocity of transcriptomic dynamics by using monotonically expressed genes (MEGs) or genes with expression patterns that either increase or decrease, but do not cycle, through phylogenetic time. Through integration of scRNA-seq data with lineage information, PhyloVelo identifies MEGs and reconstructs a transcriptomic velocity field. We validate PhyloVelo using simulated data and Caenorhabditis elegans ground truth data, successfully recovering linear, bifurcated and convergent differentiations. Applying PhyloVelo to seven lineage-traced scRNA-seq datasets, generated using CRISPR-Cas9 editing, lentiviral barcoding or immune repertoire profiling, demonstrates its high accuracy and robustness in inferring complex lineage trajectories while outperforming RNA velocity. Additionally, we discovered that MEGs across tissues and organisms share similar functions in translation and ribosome biogenesis.
34903266	2021	Genome biology	CIDER: an interpretable meta-clustering framework for single-cell RNA-seq data integration and evaluation.	Clustering of joint single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) data is often challenged by confounding factors, such as batch effects and biologically relevant variability. Existing batch effect removal methods typically require strong assumptions on the composition of cell populations being near identical across samples. Here, we present CIDER, a meta-clustering workflow based on inter-group similarity measures. We demonstrate that CIDER outperforms other scRNA-Seq clustering methods and integration approaches in both simulated and real datasets. Moreover, we show that CIDER can be used to assess the biological correctness of integration in real datasets, while it does not require the existence of prior cellular annotations.
30583733	2018	Genome biology	SCOPE-Seq: a scalable technology for linking live cell imaging and single-cell RNA sequencing.	Optically decodable beads link the identity of a sample to a measurement through an optical barcode, enabling libraries of biomolecules to be captured on beads in solution and decoded by fluorescence. This approach has been foundational to microarray, sequencing, and flow-based expression profiling technologies. We combine microfluidics with optically decodable beads and show that phenotypic analysis of living cells can be linked to single-cell sequencing. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of our tool called Single Cell Optical Phenotyping and Expression sequencing (SCOPE-Seq) to combine live cell imaging with single-cell RNA sequencing.
35022082	2022	Genome biology	A deep generative model for multi-view profiling of single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data.	Here, we present a multi-modal deep generative model, the single-cell Multi-View Profiler (scMVP), which is designed for handling sequencing data that simultaneously measure gene expression and chromatin accessibility in the same cell, including SNARE-seq, sci-CAR, Paired-seq, SHARE-seq, and Multiome from 10X Genomics. scMVP generates common latent representations for dimensionality reduction, cell clustering, and developmental trajectory inference and generates separate imputations for differential analysis and cis-regulatory element identification. scMVP can help mitigate data sparsity issues with imputation and accurately identify cell groups for different joint profiling techniques with common latent embedding, and we demonstrate its advantages on several realistic datasets.
39242194	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	BANMF-S: a blockwise accelerated non-negative matrix factorization framework with structural network constraints for single cell imputation.	MOTIVATION: Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technique enables the transcriptome profiling of hundreds to ten thousands of cells at the unprecedented individual level and provides new insights to study cell heterogeneity. However, its advantages are hampered by dropout events. To address this problem, we propose a Blockwise Accelerated Non-negative Matrix Factorization framework with Structural network constraints (BANMF-S) to impute those technical zeros. RESULTS: BANMF-S constructs a gene-gene similarity network to integrate prior information from the external PPI network by the Triadic Closure Principle and a cell-cell similarity network to capture the neighborhood structure and temporal information through a Minimum-Spanning Tree. By collaboratively employing these two networks as regularizations, BANMF-S encourages the coherence of similar gene and cell pairs in the latent space, enhancing the potential to recover the underlying features. Besides, BANMF-S adopts a blocklization strategy to solve the traditional NMF problem through distributed Stochastic Gradient Descent method in a parallel way to accelerate the optimization. Numerical experiments on simulations and real datasets verify that BANMF-S can improve the accuracy of downstream clustering and pseudo-trajectory inference, and its performance is superior to seven state-of-the-art algorithms. AVAILABILITY: All data used in this work are downloaded from publicly available data sources, and their corresponding accession numbers or source URLs are provided in Supplementary File Section 5.1 Dataset Information. The source codes are publicly available in Github repository https://github.com/jiayingzhao/BANMF-S.
40116659	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	AttentionGRN: a functional and directed graph transformer for gene regulatory network reconstruction from scRNA-seq data.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables the reconstruction of cell type-specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs), offering detailed insights into gene regulation at high resolution. While graph neural networks have become widely used for GRN inference, their message-passing mechanisms are often limited by issues such as over-smoothing and over-squashing, which hinder the preservation of essential network structure. To address these challenges, we propose a novel graph transformer-based model, AttentionGRN, which leverages soft encoding to enhance model expressiveness and improve the accuracy of GRN inference from scRNA-seq data. Furthermore, the GRN-oriented message aggregation strategies are designed to capture both the directed network structure information and functional information inherent in GRNs. Specifically, we design directed structure encoding to facilitate the learning of directed network topologies and employ functional gene sampling to capture key functional modules and global network structure. Our extensive experiments, conducted on 88 datasets across two distinct tasks, demonstrate that AttentionGRN consistently outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, AttentionGRN has been successfully applied to reconstruct cell type-specific GRNs for human mature hepatocytes, revealing novel hub genes and previously unidentified transcription factor-target gene regulatory associations.
28011787	2017	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	switchde: inference of switch-like differential expression along single-cell trajectories.	MOTIVATION: Pseudotime analyses of single-cell RNA-seq data have become increasingly common. Typically, a latent trajectory corresponding to a biological process of interest-such as differentiation or cell cycle-is discovered. However, relatively little attention has been paid to modelling the differential expression of genes along such trajectories. RESULTS: We present switchde , a statistical framework and accompanying R package for identifying switch-like differential expression of genes along pseudotemporal trajectories. Our method includes fast model fitting that provides interpretable parameter estimates corresponding to how quickly a gene is up or down regulated as well as where in the trajectory such regulation occurs. It also reports a P -value in favour of rejecting a constant-expression model for switch-like differential expression and optionally models the zero-inflation prevalent in single-cell data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The R package switchde is available through the Bioconductor project at https://bioconductor.org/packages/switchde . CONTACT: kieran.campbell@sjc.ox.ac.uk. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
25079858	2014	Genome research	Tn5 transposase and tagmentation procedures for massively scaled sequencing projects.	Massively parallel DNA sequencing of thousands of samples in a single machine-run is now possible, but the preparation of the individual sequencing libraries is expensive and time-consuming. Tagmentation-based library construction, using the Tn5 transposase, is efficient for generating sequencing libraries but currently relies on undisclosed reagents, which severely limits development of novel applications and the execution of large-scale projects. Here, we present simple and robust procedures for Tn5 transposase production and optimized reaction conditions for tagmentation-based sequencing library construction. We further show how molecular crowding agents both modulate library lengths and enable efficient tagmentation from subpicogram amounts of cDNA. The comparison of single-cell RNA-sequencing libraries generated using produced and commercial Tn5 demonstrated equal performances in terms of gene detection and library characteristics. Finally, because naked Tn5 can be annealed to any oligonucleotide of choice, for example, molecular barcodes in single-cell assays or methylated oligonucleotides for bisulfite sequencing, custom Tn5 production and tagmentation enable innovation in sequencing-based applications.
39120880	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	TransTEx: novel tissue-specificity scoring method for grouping human transcriptome into different expression groups.	MOTIVATION: Although human tissues carry out common molecular processes, gene expression patterns can distinguish different tissues. Traditional informatics methods, primarily at the gene level, overlook the complexity of alternative transcript variants and protein isoforms produced by most genes, changes in which are linked to disease prognosis and drug resistance. RESULTS: We developed TransTEx (Transcript-level Tissue Expression), a novel tissue-specificity scoring method, for grouping transcripts into four expression groups. TransTEx applies sequential cut-offs to tissue-wise transcript probability estimates, subsampling-based P-values and fold-change estimates. Application of TransTEx on GTEx mRNA-seq data divided 199 166 human transcripts into different groups as 17 999 tissue-specific (TSp), 7436 tissue-enhanced, 36 783 widely expressed (Wide), 79 191 lowly expressed (Low), and 57 757 no expression (Null) transcripts. Testis has the most (13 466) TSp isoforms followed by liver (890), brain (701), pituitary (435), and muscle (420). We found that the tissue specificity of alternative transcripts of a gene is predominantly influenced by alternate promoter usage. By overlapping brain-specific transcripts with the cell-type gene-markers in scBrainMap database, we found that 63% of the brain-specific transcripts were enriched in nonneuronal cell types, predominantly astrocytes followed by endothelial cells and oligodendrocytes. In addition, we found 61 brain cell-type marker genes encoding a total of 176 alternative transcripts as brain-specific and 22 alternative transcripts as testis-specific, highlighting the complex TSp and cell-type specific gene regulation and expression at isoform-level. TransTEx can be adopted to the analysis of bulk RNA-seq or scRNA-seq datasets to find tissue- and/or cell-type specific isoform-level gene markers. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: TransTEx database: https://bmi.cewit.stonybrook.edu/transtexdb/ and the R package is available via GitHub: https://github.com/pallavisurana1/TransTEx.
31372654	2019	Nucleic acids research	LTMG: a novel statistical modeling of transcriptional expression states in single-cell RNA-Seq data.	A key challenge in modeling single-cell RNA-seq data is to capture the diversity of gene expression states regulated by different transcriptional regulatory inputs across individual cells, which is further complicated by largely observed zero and low expressions. We developed a left truncated mixture Gaussian (LTMG) model, from the kinetic relationships of the transcriptional regulatory inputs, mRNA metabolism and abundance in single cells. LTMG infers the expression multi-modalities across single cells, meanwhile, the dropouts and low expressions are treated as left truncated. We demonstrated that LTMG has significantly better goodness of fitting on an extensive number of scRNA-seq data, comparing to three other state-of-the-art models. Our biological assumption of the low non-zero expressions, rationality of the multimodality setting, and the capability of LTMG in extracting expression states specific to cell types or functions, are validated on independent experimental data sets. A differential gene expression test and a co-regulation module identification method are further developed. We experimentally validated that our differential expression test has higher sensitivity and specificity, compared with other five popular methods. The co-regulation analysis is capable of retrieving gene co-regulation modules corresponding to perturbed transcriptional regulations. A user-friendly R package with all the analysis power is available at https://github.com/zy26/LTMGSCA.
32502143	2020	PLoS computational biology	Detecting differential alternative splicing events in scRNA-seq with or without Unique Molecular Identifiers.	"The emergence of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) technology has made it possible to measure gene expression variations at cellular level. This breakthrough enables the investigation of a wider range of problems including analysis of splicing heterogeneity among individual cells. However, compared to bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq data are much noisier due to high technical variability and low sequencing depth. Here we propose SCATS (Single-Cell Analysis of Transcript Splicing) for differential splicing analysis in scRNA-seq, which achieves high sensitivity at low coverage by accounting for technical noise. SCATS models scRNA-seq data either with or without Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs). For non-UMI data, SCATS explicitly models technical noise by accounting for capture efficiency and amplification bias through the use of external spike-ins; for UMI data, SCATS models capture efficiency and further accounts for transcriptional burstiness. A key aspect of SCATS lies in its ability to group ""exons"" that originate from the same isoform(s). Grouping exons is essential in splicing analysis of scRNA-seq data as it naturally aggregates spliced reads across different exons, making it possible to detect splicing events even when sequencing depth is low. To evaluate the performance of SCATS, we analyzed both simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets and compared with existing methods including Census and DEXSeq. We show that SCATS has well controlled type I error rate, and is more powerful than existing methods, especially when splicing difference is small. In contrast, Census suffers from severe type I error inflation, whereas DEXSeq is more conservative. When applied to mouse brain scRNA-seq datasets, SCATS identified more differential splicing events with subtle difference across cell types compared to Census and DEXSeq. With the increasing adoption of scRNA-seq, we believe SCATS will be well-suited for various splicing studies. The implementation of SCATS can be downloaded from https://github.com/huyustats/SCATS."
31665245	2019	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	ImSpectR - R package to quantify immune repertoire diversity in spectratype and repertoire sequencing data.	SUMMARY: An effective immune system is characterized by a diverse immune repertoire. There is a strong demand for accurate and quantitative methods to assess the diversity of the immune repertoire for various (pre-)clinical applications, including the diagnosis and prognosis of primary immune deficiencies, or to assess the response to therapy. Current strategies for immune diversity assessment generally comprise the visual inspection of the length distribution of rearranged T- and B-cell receptors. Visual inspections, however, are prone to subjective assessments and thus lead to biases. Here, we introduce ImSpectR, a unified approach to quantify immunodiversity using either spectratype, repertoire sequencing or single cell RNA sequencing data. ImSpectR scores various types of deviations from the expected length distribution and integrates these into one measure, allowing for robust quantitative comparisons of immune diversity across individuals or conditions. AVAILABILITY: R-package is available for download on GitHub at https://github.com/martijn-cordes/ImSpectR. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
33724985	2021	PLoS computational biology	JSOM: Jointly-evolving self-organizing maps for alignment of biological datasets and identification of related clusters.	With the rapid advances of various single-cell technologies, an increasing number of single-cell datasets are being generated, and the computational tools for aligning the datasets which make subsequent integration or meta-analysis possible have become critical. Typically, single-cell datasets from different technologies cannot be directly combined or concatenated, due to the innate difference in the data, such as the number of measured parameters and the distributions. Even datasets generated by the same technology are often affected by the batch effect. A computational approach for aligning different datasets and hence identifying related clusters will be useful for data integration and interpretation in large scale single-cell experiments. Our proposed algorithm called JSOM, a variation of the Self-organizing map, aligns two related datasets that contain similar clusters, by constructing two maps-low-dimensional discretized representation of datasets-that jointly evolve according to both datasets. Here we applied the JSOM algorithm to flow cytometry, mass cytometry, and single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. The resulting JSOM maps not only align the related clusters in the two datasets but also preserve the topology of the datasets so that the maps could be used for further analysis, such as clustering.
40637232	2025	Nucleic acids research	Telomeric repeat-containing RNA increases in aged human cells.	Telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA), transcribed from subtelomeric regions toward telomeric ends, poses challenges in deciphering its complete sequences. Utilizing TERRA-capture RNA-seq and Oxford Nanopore direct RNA sequencing to acquire full-length TERRA, we annotate TERRA transcription regions in the human T2T-CHM13 reference genome. TERRA transcripts encompass hundreds to over a thousand nucleotides of telomeric repeats, predominantly originating from 61-29-37 bp repeat promoters enriched with H3K4me3, RNA Pol II, CTCF, and R-loops. We develop a bioinformatics tool, TERRA-QUANT, for quantifying TERRA using RNA-seq datasets and find that TERRA increases with age in blood, brain, and fibroblasts. TERRA upregulation in aged leukocytes is confirmed by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis demonstrates TERRA expression across various cell types, with upregulation observed in neurons during human embryonic stem cell differentiation. Additionally, TERRA levels are elevated in brain cells in the early stage of Alzheimer's disease. Our study provides evidence linking TERRA to human aging and diseases.
38195207	2024	Genome research	A Bayesian framework to study tumor subclone-specific expression by combining bulk DNA and single-cell RNA sequencing data.	Genetic and gene expression heterogeneity is an essential hallmark of many tumors, allowing the cancer to evolve and to develop resistance to treatment. Currently, the most commonly used data types for studying such heterogeneity are bulk tumor/normal whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing (WGS, WES); and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), respectively. However, tools are currently lacking to link genomic tumor subclonality with transcriptomic heterogeneity by integrating genomic and single-cell transcriptomic data collected from the same tumor. To address this gap, we developed scBayes, a Bayesian probabilistic framework that uses tumor subclonal structure inferred from bulk DNA sequencing data to determine the subclonal identity of cells from single-cell gene expression (scRNA-seq) measurements. Grouping together cells representing the same genetically defined tumor subclones allows comparison of gene expression across different subclones, or investigation of gene expression changes within the same subclone across time (i.e., progression, treatment response, or relapse) or space (i.e., at multiple metastatic sites and organs). We used simulated data sets, in silico synthetic data sets, as well as biological data sets generated from cancer samples to extensively characterize and validate the performance of our method, as well as to show improvements over existing methods. We show the validity and utility of our approach by applying it to published data sets and recapitulating the findings, as well as arriving at novel insights into cancer subclonal expression behavior in our own data sets. We further show that our method is applicable to a wide range of single-cell sequencing technologies including single-cell DNA sequencing as well as Smart-seq and 10x Genomics scRNA-seq protocols.
36849830	2023	Nature biotechnology	scPrisma infers, filters and enhances topological signals in single-cell data using spectral template matching.	Single-cell RNA sequencing has been instrumental in uncovering cellular spatiotemporal context. This task is challenging as cells simultaneously encode multiple, potentially cross-interfering, biological signals. Here we propose scPrisma, a spectral computational method that uses topological priors to decouple, enhance and filter different classes of biological processes in single-cell data, such as periodic and linear signals. We apply scPrisma to the analysis of the cell cycle in HeLa cells, circadian rhythm and spatial zonation in liver lobules, diurnal cycle in Chlamydomonas and circadian rhythm in the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the brain. scPrisma can be used to distinguish mixed cellular populations by specific characteristics such as cell type and uncover regulatory networks and cell-cell interactions specific to predefined biological signals, such as the circadian rhythm. We show scPrisma's flexibility in incorporating prior knowledge, inference of topologically informative genes and generalization to additional diverse templates and systems. scPrisma can be used as a stand-alone workflow for signal analysis and as a prior step for downstream single-cell analysis.
37528411	2023	Genome biology	Effective methods for bulk RNA-seq deconvolution using scnRNA-seq transcriptomes.	BACKGROUND: RNA profiling technologies at single-cell resolutions, including single-cell and single-nuclei RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq, scnRNA-seq for short), can help characterize the composition of tissues and reveal cells that influence key functions in both healthy and disease tissues. However, the use of these technologies is operationally challenging because of high costs and stringent sample-collection requirements. Computational deconvolution methods that infer the composition of bulk-profiled samples using scnRNA-seq-characterized cell types can broaden scnRNA-seq applications, but their effectiveness remains controversial. RESULTS: We produced the first systematic evaluation of deconvolution methods on datasets with either known or scnRNA-seq-estimated compositions. Our analyses revealed biases that are common to scnRNA-seq 10X Genomics assays and illustrated the importance of accurate and properly controlled data preprocessing and method selection and optimization. Moreover, our results suggested that concurrent RNA-seq and scnRNA-seq profiles can help improve the accuracy of both scnRNA-seq preprocessing and the deconvolution methods that employ them. Indeed, our proposed method, Single-cell RNA Quantity Informed Deconvolution (SQUID), which combines RNA-seq transformation and dampened weighted least-squares deconvolution approaches, consistently outperformed other methods in predicting the composition of cell mixtures and tissue samples. CONCLUSIONS: We showed that analysis of concurrent RNA-seq and scnRNA-seq profiles with SQUID can produce accurate cell-type abundance estimates and that this accuracy improvement was necessary for identifying outcomes-predictive cancer cell subclones in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia and neuroblastoma datasets. These results suggest that deconvolution accuracy improvements are vital to enabling its applications in the life sciences.
39508444	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	SpaDiT: diffusion transformer for spatial gene expression prediction using scRNA-seq.	The rapid development of spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) technologies has provided unprecedented opportunities for exploring the structure of specific organs or tissues. However, these techniques (such as image-based SRT) can achieve single-cell resolution, but can only capture the expression levels of tens to hundreds of genes. Such spatial transcriptomics (ST) data, carrying a large number of undetected genes, have limited its application value. To address the challenge, we develop SpaDiT, a deep learning framework for spatial reconstruction and gene expression prediction using scRNA-seq data. SpaDiT employs scRNA-seq data as an a priori condition and utilizes shared genes between ST and scRNA-seq data as latent representations to construct inputs, thereby facilitating the accurate prediction of gene expression in ST data. SpaDiT enhances the accuracy of spatial gene expression predictions over a variety of spatial transcriptomics datasets. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of SpaDiT by conducting extensive experiments on both seq-based and image-based ST data. We compared SpaDiT with eight highly effective baseline methods and found that our proposed method achieved an 8%-12% improvement in performance across multiple metrics. Source code and all datasets used in this paper are available at https://github.com/wenwenmin/SpaDiT and https://zenodo.org/records/12792074.
39559832	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	SIngle cell level Genotyping Using scRna Data (SIGURD).	MOTIVATION: By accounting for variants within measured transcripts, it is possible to evaluate the status of somatic variants using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and to characterize their clonality. However, the sparsity (very few reads per transcript) or bias in protocols (favoring 3' ends of the transcripts) makes the chance of capturing somatic variants very unlikely. This can be overcome by targeted sequencing or the use of mitochondrial variants as natural barcodes for clone identification. Currently, available computational tools focus on genotyping, but do not provide functionality for combined analysis of somatic and mitochondrial variants and functional analysis such as characterization of gene expression changes in detected clones. RESULTS: Here, we propose SIGURD (SIngle cell level Genotyping Using scRna Data) (SIGURD), which is an R-based pipeline for the clonal analysis of scRNA-seq data. This allows the quantification of clones by leveraging both somatic and mitochondrial variants. SIGURD also allows for functional analysis after clonal detection: association of clones with cell populations, detection of differentially expressed genes across clones, and association of somatic and mitochondrial variants. Here, we demonstrate the power of SIGURD by analyzing single-cell data of colony-forming cells derived from patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms.
37354494	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Modelling capture efficiency of single-cell RNA-sequencing data improves inference of transcriptome-wide burst kinetics.	MOTIVATION: Gene expression is characterized by stochastic bursts of transcription that occur at brief and random periods of promoter activity. The kinetics of gene expression burstiness differs across the genome and is dependent on the promoter sequence, among other factors. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has made it possible to quantify the cell-to-cell variability in transcription at a global genome-wide level. However, scRNA-seq data are prone to technical variability, including low and variable capture efficiency of transcripts from individual cells. RESULTS: Here, we propose a novel mathematical theory for the observed variability in scRNA-seq data. Our method captures burst kinetics and variability in both the cell size and capture efficiency, which allows us to propose several likelihood-based and simulation-based methods for the inference of burst kinetics from scRNA-seq data. Using both synthetic and real data, we show that the simulation-based methods provide an accurate, robust and flexible tool for inferring burst kinetics from scRNA-seq data. In particular, in a supervised manner, a simulation-based inference method based on neural networks proves to be accurate and useful when applied to both allele and nonallele-specific scRNA-seq data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The code for Neural Network and Approximate Bayesian Computation inference is available at https://github.com/WT215/nnRNA and https://github.com/WT215/Julia_ABC, respectively.
38181047	2024	PLoS computational biology	sc2MeNetDrug: A computational tool to uncover inter-cell signaling targets and identify relevant drugs based on single cell RNA-seq data.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful technology to investigate the transcriptional programs in stromal, immune, and disease cells, like tumor cells or neurons within the Alzheimer's Disease (AD) brain or tumor microenvironment (ME) or niche. Cell-cell communications within ME play important roles in disease progression and immunotherapy response and are novel and critical therapeutic targets. Though many tools of scRNA-seq analysis have been developed to investigate the heterogeneity and sub-populations of cells, few were designed for uncovering cell-cell communications of ME and predicting the potentially effective drugs to inhibit the communications. Moreover, the data analysis processes of discovering signaling communication networks and effective drugs using scRNA-seq data are complex and involve a set of critical analysis processes and external supportive data resources, which are difficult for researchers who have no strong computational background and training in scRNA-seq data analysis. To address these challenges, in this study, we developed a novel open-source computational tool, sc2MeNetDrug (https://fuhaililab.github.io/sc2MeNetDrug/). It was specifically designed using scRNA-seq data to identify cell types within disease MEs, uncover the dysfunctional signaling pathways within individual cell types and interactions among different cell types, and predict effective drugs that can potentially disrupt cell-cell signaling communications. sc2MeNetDrug provided a user-friendly graphical user interface to encapsulate the data analysis modules, which can facilitate the scRNA-seq data-based discovery of novel inter-cell signaling communications and novel therapeutic regimens.
27122128	2016	Genome biology	Pooling across cells to normalize single-cell RNA sequencing data with many zero counts.	Normalization of single-cell RNA sequencing data is necessary to eliminate cell-specific biases prior to downstream analyses. However, this is not straightforward for noisy single-cell data where many counts are zero. We present a novel approach where expression values are summed across pools of cells, and the summed values are used for normalization. Pool-based size factors are then deconvolved to yield cell-based factors. Our deconvolution approach outperforms existing methods for accurate normalization of cell-specific biases in simulated data. Similar behavior is observed in real data, where deconvolution improves the relevance of results of downstream analyses.
40702544	2025	Genome biology	Joint representation and visualization of derailed cell states with Decipher.	Biological insights often depend on comparing conditions such as disease and health. Yet, we lack effective computational tools for integrating single-cell genomics data across conditions or characterizing transitions from normal to deviant cell states. Here, we present Decipher, a deep generative model that characterizes derailed cell-state trajectories. Decipher jointly models and visualizes gene expression and cell state from normal and perturbed single-cell RNA-seq data, revealing shared and disrupted dynamics. We demonstrate its superior performance across diverse contexts, including in pancreatitis with oncogene mutation, acute myeloid leukemia, and gastric cancer.
35512331	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	scESI: evolutionary sparse imputation for single-cell transcriptomes from nearest neighbor cells.	The ubiquitous dropout problem in single-cell RNA sequencing technology causes a large amount of data noise in the gene expression profile. For this reason, we propose an evolutionary sparse imputation (ESI) algorithm for single-cell transcriptomes, which constructs a sparse representation model based on gene regulation relationships between cells. To solve this model, we design an optimization framework based on nondominated sorting genetics. This framework takes into account the topological relationship between cells and the variety of gene expression to iteratively search the global optimal solution, thereby learning the Pareto optimal cell-cell affinity matrix. Finally, we use the learned sparse relationship model between cells to improve data quality and reduce data noise. In simulated datasets, scESI performed significantly better than benchmark methods with various metrics. By applying scESI to real scRNA-seq datasets, we discovered scESI can not only further classify the cell types and separate cells in visualization successfully but also improve the performance in reconstructing trajectories differentiation and identifying differentially expressed genes. In addition, scESI successfully recovered the expression trends of marker genes in stem cell differentiation and can discover new cell types and putative pathways regulating biological processes.
34370020	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	TIPS: trajectory inference of pathway significance through pseudotime comparison for functional assessment of single-cell RNAseq data.	Recent advances in bioinformatics analyses have led to the development of novel tools enabling the capture and trajectory mapping of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data. However, there is a lack of methods to assess the contributions of biological pathways and transcription factors to an overall developmental trajectory mapped from scRNAseq data. In this manuscript, we present a simplified approach for trajectory inference of pathway significance (TIPS) that leverages existing knowledgebases of functional pathways and other gene lists to provide further mechanistic insights into a biological process. TIPS identifies key pathways which contribute to a process of interest, as well as the individual genes that best reflect these changes. TIPS also provides insight into the relative timing of pathway changes, as well as a suite of visualizations to enable simplified data interpretation of scRNAseq libraries generated using a wide range of techniques. The TIPS package can be run through either a web server or downloaded as a user-friendly GUI run in R, and may serve as a useful tool to help biologists perform deeper functional analyses and visualization of their single-cell data.
37527018	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	demuxmix: demultiplexing oligonucleotide-barcoded single-cell RNA sequencing data with regression mixture models.	MOTIVATION: Droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is widely used in biomedical research for interrogating the transcriptomes of single cells on a large scale. Pooling and processing cells from different samples together can reduce costs and batch effects. To pool cells, they are often first labeled with hashtag oligonucleotides (HTOs). These HTOs are sequenced alongside the cells' RNA in the droplets and subsequently used to computationally assign each droplet to its sample of origin, a process referred to as demultiplexing. Accurate demultiplexing is crucial but can be challenging due to background HTOs, low-quality cells/cell debris, and multiplets. RESULTS: A new demultiplexing method based on negative binomial regression mixture models is introduced. The method, called demuxmix, implements two significant improvements. First, demuxmix's probabilistic classification framework provides error probabilities for droplet assignments that can be used to discard uncertain droplets and inform about the quality of the HTO data and the success of the demultiplexing process. Second, demuxmix utilizes the positive association between detected genes in the RNA library and HTO counts to explain parts of the variance in the HTO data resulting in improved droplet assignments. The improved performance of demuxmix compared with existing demultiplexing methods is assessed using real and simulated data. Finally, the feasibility of accurately demultiplexing experimental designs where non-labeled cells are pooled with labeled cells is demonstrated. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: R/Bioconductor package demuxmix (https://doi.org/doi:10.18129/B9.bioc.demuxmix).
40577285	2025	PLoS computational biology	scRepertoire 2: Enhanced and efficient toolkit for single-cell immune profiling.	Single-cell adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (scAIRR-seq) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provide a transformative approach to profiling immune responses at unprecedented resolution across diverse pathophysiologic contexts. This work presents scRepertoire 2, a substantial update to our R package for analyzing and visualizing single-cell immune receptor data. This new version introduces an array of features designed to enhance both the depth and breadth of immune receptor analysis, including improved workflows for clonotype tracking, repertoire diversity metrics, and novel visualization modules that facilitate longitudinal and comparative studies. Additionally, scRepertoire 2 offers seamless integration with contemporary single-cell analysis frameworks like Seurat and SingleCellExperiment, allowing users to conduct end-to-end single-cell immune profiling with transcriptomic data. Performance optimizations in scRepertoire 2 resulted in a 85.1% increase in speed and a 91.9% reduction in memory usage from the first version over the range repertoire size tested in benchmarking, addressing the demands of the ever-increasing size and scale of single-cell studies. This release marks an advancement in single cell immunogenomics, equipping researchers with a robust toolset to uncover immune dynamics in health and disease.
38291503	2024	Genome biology	deMULTIplex2: robust sample demultiplexing for scRNA-seq.	Sample multiplexing enables pooled analysis during single-cell RNA sequencing workflows, thereby increasing throughput and reducing batch effects. A challenge for all multiplexing techniques is to link sample-specific barcodes with cell-specific barcodes, then demultiplex sample identity post-sequencing. However, existing demultiplexing tools fail under many real-world conditions where barcode cross-contamination is an issue. We therefore developed deMULTIplex2, an algorithm inspired by a mechanistic model of barcode cross-contamination. deMULTIplex2 employs generalized linear models and expectation-maximization to probabilistically determine the sample identity of each cell. Benchmarking reveals superior performance across various experimental conditions, particularly on large or noisy datasets with unbalanced sample compositions.
33295604	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	glmGamPoi: fitting Gamma-Poisson generalized linear models on single cell count data.	MOTIVATION: The Gamma-Poisson distribution is a theoretically and empirically motivated model for the sampling variability of single cell RNA-sequencing counts and an essential building block for analysis approaches including differential expression analysis, principal component analysis and factor analysis. Existing implementations for inferring its parameters from data often struggle with the size of single cell datasets, which can comprise millions of cells; at the same time, they do not take full advantage of the fact that zero and other small numbers are frequent in the data. These limitations have hampered uptake of the model, leaving room for statistically inferior approaches such as logarithm(-like) transformation. RESULTS: We present a new R package for fitting the Gamma-Poisson distribution to data with the characteristics of modern single cell datasets more quickly and more accurately than existing methods. The software can work with data on disk without having to load them into RAM simultaneously. AVAILABILITYAND IMPLEMENTATION: The package glmGamPoi is available from Bioconductor for Windows, macOS and Linux, and source code is available on github.com/const-ae/glmGamPoi under a GPL-3 license. The scripts to reproduce the results of this paper are available on github.com/const-ae/glmGamPoi-Paper. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
35380623	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	MTD: a unique pipeline for host and meta-transcriptome joint and integrative analyses of RNA-seq data.	Ribonucleic acid (RNA)-seq data contain not only host transcriptomes but also nonhost information that comprises transcripts from active microbiota in the host cells. Therefore, joint and integrative analyses of both host and meta-transcriptome can reveal gene expression of the microbial community in a given sample as well as the correlative and interactive dynamics of the host response to the microbiome. However, there are no convenient tools that can systemically analyze host-microbiota interactions through simultaneously quantifying the host and meta-transcriptome in the same sample at the tissue and the single-cell level. This poses a challenge for interested researchers with limited expertise in bioinformatics. Here, we developed a software pipeline that can comprehensively and synergistically analyze and correlate the host and meta-transcriptome in a single sample using bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data. This pipeline, named meta-transcriptome detector (MTD), can extensively identify and quantify microbiome, including viruses, bacteria, protozoa, fungi, plasmids and vectors, in the host cells and correlate the microbiome with the host transcriptome. MTD is easy to install and run, involving only a few lines of simple commands. It offers researchers with unique genomics insights into host responses to microorganisms.
37903416	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	scMultiGAN: cell-specific imputation for single-cell transcriptomes with multiple deep generative adversarial networks.	The emergence of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has revolutionized the identification of cell types and the study of cellular states at a single-cell level. Despite its significant potential, scRNA-seq data analysis is plagued by the issue of missing values. Many existing imputation methods rely on simplistic data distribution assumptions while ignoring the intrinsic gene expression distribution specific to cells. This work presents a novel deep-learning model, named scMultiGAN, for scRNA-seq imputation, which utilizes multiple collaborative generative adversarial networks (GAN). Unlike traditional GAN-based imputation methods that generate missing values based on random noises, scMultiGAN employs a two-stage training process and utilizes multiple GANs to achieve cell-specific imputation. Experimental results show the efficacy of scMultiGAN in imputation accuracy, cell clustering, differential gene expression analysis and trajectory analysis, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, scMultiGAN is scalable to large scRNA-seq datasets and consistently performs well across sequencing platforms. The scMultiGAN code is freely available at https://github.com/Galaxy8172/scMultiGAN.
39133097	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Reconstruction of gene regulatory networks for Caenorhabditis elegans using tree-shaped gene expression data.	Constructing gene regulatory networks is a widely adopted approach for investigating gene regulation, offering diverse applications in biology and medicine. A great deal of research focuses on using time series data or single-cell RNA-sequencing data to infer gene regulatory networks. However, such gene expression data lack either cellular or temporal information. Fortunately, the advent of time-lapse confocal laser microscopy enables biologists to obtain tree-shaped gene expression data of Caenorhabditis elegans, achieving both cellular and temporal resolution. Although such tree-shaped data provide abundant knowledge, they pose challenges like non-pairwise time series, laying the inaccuracy of downstream analysis. To address this issue, a comprehensive framework for data integration and a novel Bayesian approach based on Boolean network with time delay are proposed. The pre-screening process and Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm are applied to obtain the parameter estimates. Simulation studies show that our method outperforms existing Boolean network inference algorithms. Leveraging the proposed approach, gene regulatory networks for five subtrees are reconstructed based on the real tree-shaped datatsets of Caenorhabditis elegans, where some gene regulatory relationships confirmed in previous genetic studies are recovered. Also, heterogeneity of regulatory relationships in different cell lineage subtrees is detected. Furthermore, the exploration of potential gene regulatory relationships that bear importance in human diseases is undertaken. All source code is available at the GitHub repository https://github.com/edawu11/BBTD.git.
37798250	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Interpretable modeling of time-resolved single-cell gene-protein expression with CrossmodalNet.	Cell-surface proteins play a critical role in cell function and are primary targets for therapeutics. CITE-seq is a single-cell technique that enables simultaneous measurement of gene and surface protein expression. It is powerful but costly and technically challenging. Computational methods have been developed to predict surface protein expression using gene expression information such as from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Existing methods however are computationally demanding and lack the interpretability to reveal underlying biological processes. We propose CrossmodalNet, an interpretable machine learning model, to predict surface protein expression from scRNA-seq data. Our model with a customized adaptive loss accurately predicts surface protein abundances. When samples from multiple time points are given, our model encodes temporal information into an easy-to-interpret time embedding to make prediction in a time-point-specific manner, and is able to uncover noise-free causal gene-protein relationships. Using three publicly available time-resolved CITE-seq data sets, we validate the performance of our model by comparing it with benchmarking methods and evaluate its interpretability. Together, we show that our method accurately and interpretably profiles surface protein expression using scRNA-seq data, thereby expanding the capacity of CITE-seq experiments for investigating molecular mechanisms involving surface proteins.
29490015	2018	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Isoform-level gene expression patterns in single-cell RNA-sequencing data.	MOTIVATION: RNA sequencing of single cells enables characterization of transcriptional heterogeneity in seemingly homogeneous cell populations. Single-cell sequencing has been applied in a wide range of researches fields. However, few studies have focus on characterization of isoform-level expression patterns at the single-cell level. In this study, we propose and apply a novel method, ISOform-Patterns (ISOP), based on mixture modeling, to characterize the expression patterns of isoform pairs from the same gene in single-cell isoform-level expression data. RESULTS: We define six principal patterns of isoform expression relationships and describe a method for differential-pattern analysis. We demonstrate ISOP through analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data from a breast cancer cell line, with replication in three independent datasets. We assigned the pattern types to each of 16 562 isoform-pairs from 4929 genes. Among those, 26% of the discovered patterns were significant (P<0.05), while remaining patterns are possibly effects of transcriptional bursting, drop-out and stochastic biological heterogeneity. Furthermore, 32% of genes discovered through differential-pattern analysis were not detected by differential-expression analysis. Finally, the effects of drop-out events and expression levels of isoforms on ISOP's performances were investigated through simulated datasets. To conclude, ISOP provides a novel approach for characterization of isoform-level preference, commitment and heterogeneity in single-cell RNA-sequencing data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The ISOP method has been implemented as a R package and is available at https://github.com/nghiavtr/ISOP under a GPL-3 license. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
32339163	2020	PLoS computational biology	Scedar: A scalable Python package for single-cell RNA-seq exploratory data analysis.	In single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) experiments, the number of individual cells has increased exponentially, and the sequencing depth of each cell has decreased significantly. As a result, analyzing scRNA-seq data requires extensive considerations of program efficiency and method selection. In order to reduce the complexity of scRNA-seq data analysis, we present scedar, a scalable Python package for scRNA-seq exploratory data analysis. The package provides a convenient and reliable interface for performing visualization, imputation of gene dropouts, detection of rare transcriptomic profiles, and clustering on large-scale scRNA-seq datasets. The analytical methods are efficient, and they also do not assume that the data follow certain statistical distributions. The package is extensible and modular, which would facilitate the further development of functionalities for future requirements with the open-source development community. The scedar package is distributed under the terms of the MIT license at https://pypi.org/project/scedar.
39241106	2024	PLoS computational biology	Binomial models uncover biological variation during feature selection of droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing.	"Effective analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data requires a rigorous distinction between technical noise and biological variation. In this work, we propose a simple feature selection model, termed ""Differentially Distributed Genes"" or DDGs, where a binomial sampling process for each mRNA species produces a null model of technical variation. Using scRNA-seq data where cell identities have been established a priori, we find that the DDG model of biological variation outperforms existing methods. We demonstrate that DDGs distinguish a validated set of real biologically varying genes, minimize neighborhood distortion, and enable accurate partitioning of cells into their established cell-type groups."
34252961	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	doubletD: detecting doublets in single-cell DNA sequencing data.	MOTIVATION: While single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq) has enabled the study of intratumor heterogeneity at an unprecedented resolution, current technologies are error-prone and often result in doublets where two or more cells are mistaken for a single cell. Not only do doublets confound downstream analyses, but the increase in doublet rate is also a major bottleneck preventing higher throughput with current single-cell technologies. Although doublet detection and removal are standard practice in scRNA-seq data analysis, options for scDNA-seq data are limited. Current methods attempt to detect doublets while also performing complex downstream analyses tasks, leading to decreased efficiency and/or performance. RESULTS: We present doubletD, the first standalone method for detecting doublets in scDNA-seq data. Underlying our method is a simple maximum likelihood approach with a closed-form solution. We demonstrate the performance of doubletD on simulated data as well as real datasets, outperforming current methods for downstream analysis of scDNA-seq data that jointly infer doublets as well as standalone approaches for doublet detection in scRNA-seq data. Incorporating doubletD in scDNA-seq analysis pipelines will reduce complexity and lead to more accurate results. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: https://github.com/elkebir-group/doubletD. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
40662809	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Alevin-fry-atac enables rapid and memory frugal mapping of single-cell ATAC-seq data using virtual colors for accurate genomic pseudoalignment.	"SUMMARY: Ultrafast mapping of short reads via lightweight mapping techniques such as pseudoalignment has significantly accelerated transcriptomic and metagenomic analyses with minimal accuracy loss compared to alignment-based methods. However, applying pseudoalignment to large genomic references, like chromosomes, is challenging due to their size and repetitive sequences. We introduce a new and modified pseudoalignment scheme that partitions each reference into ""virtual colors."" These are essentially overlapping bins of fixed maximal extent on the reference sequences that are treated as distinct ""colors"" from the perspective of the pseudoalignment algorithm. We apply this modified pseudoalignment procedure to process and map single-cell ATAC-seq data in our new tool alevin-fry-atac. We compare alevin-fry-atac to both Chromap and Cell Ranger ATAC. Alevin-fry-atac is highly scalable and, when using 32 threads, is 2.8 times faster than Chromap (the second fastest approach) while using only 33% of the memory required by Chromap. The resulting peaks and clusters generated from alevin-fry-atac show high concordance with those obtained from both Chromap and the Cell Ranger ATAC pipeline, demonstrating that virtual color-enhanced pseudoalignment directly to the genome provides a fast, memory-frugal, and accurate alternative to existing approaches for single-cell ATAC-seq processing. The development of alevin-fry-atac brings single-cell ATAC-seq processing into a unified ecosystem with single-cell RNA-seq processing (via alevin-fry) to work toward providing a truly open alternative to many of the varied capabilities of CellRanger. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Alevin-fry-atac is written in Rust and C++17, and is freely-available under a BSD 3-clause license. It is integrated into piscem (https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/piscem) and alevin-fry (https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/alevin-fry), and is also supported directly as part of simpleaf (https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/simpleaf)."
36124800	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	SimBu: bias-aware simulation of bulk RNA-seq data with variable cell-type composition.	MOTIVATION: As complex tissues are typically composed of various cell types, deconvolution tools have been developed to computationally infer their cellular composition from bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. To comprehensively assess deconvolution performance, gold-standard datasets are indispensable. Gold-standard, experimental techniques like flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry are resource-intensive and cannot be systematically applied to the numerous cell types and tissues profiled with high-throughput transcriptomics. The simulation of 'pseudo-bulk' data, generated by aggregating single-cell RNA-seq expression profiles in pre-defined proportions, offers a scalable and cost-effective alternative. This makes it feasible to create in silico gold standards that allow fine-grained control of cell-type fractions not conceivable in an experimental setup. However, at present, no simulation software for generating pseudo-bulk RNA-seq data exists. RESULTS: We developed SimBu, an R package capable of simulating pseudo-bulk samples based on various simulation scenarios, designed to test specific features of deconvolution methods. A unique feature of SimBu is the modeling of cell-type-specific mRNA bias using experimentally derived or data-driven scaling factors. Here, we show that SimBu can generate realistic pseudo-bulk data, recapitulating the biological and statistical features of real RNA-seq data. Finally, we illustrate the impact of mRNA bias on the evaluation of deconvolution tools and provide recommendations for the selection of suitable methods for estimating mRNA content. SimBu is a user-friendly and flexible tool for simulating realistic pseudo-bulk RNA-seq datasets serving as in silico gold-standard for assessing cell-type deconvolution methods. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: SimBu is freely available at https://github.com/omnideconv/SimBu as an R package under the GPL-3 license. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
37749269	2024	Nature biotechnology	Single-cell lineage capture across genomic modalities with CellTag-multi reveals fate-specific gene regulatory changes.	Complex gene regulatory mechanisms underlie differentiation and reprogramming. Contemporary single-cell lineage-tracing (scLT) methods use expressed, heritable DNA barcodes to combine cell lineage readout with single-cell transcriptomics. However, reliance on transcriptional profiling limits adaptation to other single-cell assays. With CellTag-multi, we present an approach that enables direct capture of heritable random barcodes expressed as polyadenylated transcripts, in both single-cell RNA sequencing and single-cell Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin using sequencing assays, allowing for independent clonal tracking of transcriptional and epigenomic cell states. We validate CellTag-multi to characterize progenitor cell lineage priming during mouse hematopoiesis. Additionally, in direct reprogramming of fibroblasts to endoderm progenitors, we identify core regulatory programs underlying on-target and off-target fates. Furthermore, we reveal the transcription factor Zfp281 as a regulator of reprogramming outcome, biasing cells toward an off-target mesenchymal fate. Our results establish CellTag-multi as a lineage-tracing method compatible with multiple single-cell modalities and demonstrate its utility in revealing fate-specifying gene regulatory changes across diverse paradigms of differentiation and reprogramming.
40841173	2025	Genome research	Deciphering context-specific gene programs from single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data with DeCEP.	Functional gene programs play a wide range of roles in health and disease by orchestrating transcriptional coregulation to govern cell identity. Understanding these intricate gene programs is essential for unraveling the complexities of biological systems; however, deciphering them remains a significant challenge. Recent advancements in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies have empowered the comprehensive characterization of gene programs at both single-cell and spatial resolutions. Here, we present DeCEP, a computational framework designed to characterize context-specific gene programs using scRNA-seq and ST data. DeCEP leverages functional gene lists and directed graphs to construct functional networks underlying distinct cellular or spatial contexts. It then identifies context-dependent hub genes associated with specific gene programs based on network topology and assigns gene program activity to individual cells or spatial locations. Through evaluation on both simulated and real biological data sets, DeCEP demonstrates complementary strengths over existing methods by enabling more fine-grained characterization of gene programs within specific contexts, particularly those characterized by pronounced transcriptional heterogeneity. Furthermore, we showcase the ability of DeCEP in elucidating biological insights through case studies on normal liver tissue, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer.
35058621	2022	Nature biotechnology	scJoint integrates atlas-scale single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data with transfer learning.	Single-cell multiomics data continues to grow at an unprecedented pace. Although several methods have demonstrated promising results in integrating several data modalities from the same tissue, the complexity and scale of data compositions present in cell atlases still pose a challenge. Here, we present scJoint, a transfer learning method to integrate atlas-scale, heterogeneous collections of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data. scJoint leverages information from annotated scRNA-seq data in a semisupervised framework and uses a neural network to simultaneously train labeled and unlabeled data, allowing label transfer and joint visualization in an integrative framework. Using atlas data as well as multimodal datasets generated with ASAP-seq and CITE-seq, we demonstrate that scJoint is computationally efficient and consistently achieves substantially higher cell-type label accuracy than existing methods while providing meaningful joint visualizations. Thus, scJoint overcomes the heterogeneity of different data modalities to enable a more comprehensive understanding of cellular phenotypes.
34320637	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	rPanglaoDB: an R package to download and merge labeled single-cell RNA-seq data from the PanglaoDB database.	MOTIVATION: Characterizing cells with rare molecular phenotypes is one of the promises of high throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) techniques. However, collecting enough cells with the desired molecular phenotype in a single experiment is challenging, requiring several samples preprocessing steps to filter and collect the desired cells experimentally before sequencing. Data integration of multiple public single-cell experiments stands as a solution for this problem, allowing the collection of enough cells exhibiting the desired molecular signatures. By increasing the sample size of the desired cell type, this approach enables a robust cell type transcriptome characterization. RESULTS: Here, we introduce rPanglaoDB, an R package to download and merge the uniformly processed and annotated scRNA-seq data provided by the PanglaoDB database. To show the potential of rPanglaoDB for collecting rare cell types by integrating multiple public datasets, we present a biological application collecting and characterizing a set of 157 fibrocytes. Fibrocytes are a rare monocyte-derived cell type, that exhibits both the inflammatory features of macrophages and the tissue remodeling properties of fibroblasts. This constitutes the first fibrocytes' unbiased transcriptome profile report. We compared the transcriptomic profile of the fibrocytes against the fibroblasts collected from the same tissue samples and confirm their associated relationship with healing processes in tissue damage and infection through the activation of the prostaglandin biosynthesis and regulation pathway. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: rPanglaoDB is implemented as an R package available through the CRAN repositories https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rPanglaoDB.
31116393	2019	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Statistical test of structured continuous trees based on discordance matrix.	MOTIVATION: Cell fate determination is a continuous process in which one cell type diversifies to other cell types following a hierarchical path. Advancements in single-cell technologies provide the opportunity to reveal the continuum of cell progression which forms a structured continuous tree (SCTree). Computational algorithms, which are usually based on a priori assumptions on the hidden structures, have previously been proposed as a means of recovering pseudo trajectory along cell differentiation process. However, there still lack of statistical framework on the assessments of intrinsic structure embedded in high-dimensional gene expression profile. Inherit noise and cell-to-cell variation underlie the single-cell data, however, pose grand challenges to testing even basic structures, such as linear versus bifurcation. RESULTS: In this study, we propose an adaptive statistical framework, termed SCTree, to test the intrinsic structure of a high-dimensional single-cell dataset. SCTree test is conducted based on the tools derived from metric geometry and random matrix theory. In brief, by extending the Gromov-Farris transform and utilizing semicircular law, we formulate the continuous tree structure testing problem into a signal matrix detection problem. We show that the SCTree test is most powerful when the signal-to-noise ratio exceeds a moderate value. We also demonstrate that SCTree is able to robustly detect linear, single and multiple branching events with simulated datasets and real scRNA-seq datasets. Overall, the SCTree test provides a unified statistical assessment of the significance of the hidden structure of single-cell data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: SCTree software is available at https://github.com/XQBai/SCTree-test. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
33300547	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	scGMAI: a Gaussian mixture model for clustering single-cell RNA-Seq data based on deep autoencoder.	The rapid development of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) technology provides strong technical support for accurate and efficient analyzing single-cell gene expression data. However, the analysis of scRNA-Seq is accompanied by many obstacles, including dropout events and the curse of dimensionality. Here, we propose the scGMAI, which is a new single-cell Gaussian mixture clustering method based on autoencoder networks and the fast independent component analysis (FastICA). Specifically, scGMAI utilizes autoencoder networks to reconstruct gene expression values from scRNA-Seq data and FastICA is used to reduce the dimensions of reconstructed data. The integration of these computational techniques in scGMAI leads to outperforming results compared to existing tools, including Seurat, in clustering cells from 17 public scRNA-Seq datasets. In summary, scGMAI is an effective tool for accurately clustering and identifying cell types from scRNA-Seq data and shows the great potential of its applicative power in scRNA-Seq data analysis. The source code is available at https://github.com/QUST-AIBBDRC/scGMAI/.
26780092	2016	Nature methods	Characterizing transcriptional heterogeneity through pathway and gene set overdispersion analysis.	The transcriptional state of a cell reflects a variety of biological factors, from cell-type-specific features to transient processes such as the cell cycle, all of which may be of interest. However, identifying such aspects from noisy single-cell RNA-seq data remains challenging. We developed pathway and gene set overdispersion analysis (PAGODA) to resolve multiple, potentially overlapping aspects of transcriptional heterogeneity by testing gene sets for coordinated variability among measured cells.
36625255	2023	Nucleic acids research	ONECUT2 regulates RANKL-dependent enterocyte and microfold cell differentiation in the small intestine; a multi-omics study.	Microfold (M) cells reside in the intestinal epithelium of Peyer's patches (PP). Their unique ability to take up and transport antigens from the intestinal lumen to the underlying lymphoid tissue is key in the regulation of the gut-associated immune response. Here, we applied a multi-omics approach to investigate the molecular mechanisms that drive M cell differentiation in mouse small intestinal organoids. We generated a comprehensive profile of chromatin accessibility changes and transcription factor dynamics during in vitro M cell differentiation, allowing us to uncover numerous cell type-specific regulatory elements and associated transcription factors. By using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified an enterocyte and M cell precursor population. We used our newly developed computational tool SCEPIA to link precursor cell-specific gene expression to transcription factor motif activity in cis-regulatory elements, uncovering high expression of and motif activity for the transcription factor ONECUT2. Subsequent in vitro and in vivo perturbation experiments revealed that ONECUT2 acts downstream of the RANK/RANKL signalling axis to support enterocyte differentiation, thereby restricting M cell lineage specification. This study sheds new light on the mechanism regulating cell fate balance in the PP, and it provides a powerful blueprint for investigation of cell fate switches in the intestinal epithelium.
36513377	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	RefTM: reference-guided topic modeling of single-cell chromatin accessibility data.	Single-cell analysis is a valuable approach for dissecting the cellular heterogeneity, and single-cell chromatin accessibility sequencing (scCAS) can profile the epigenetic landscapes for thousands of individual cells. It is challenging to analyze scCAS data, because of its high dimensionality and a higher degree of sparsity compared with scRNA-seq data. Topic modeling in single-cell data analysis can lead to robust identification of the cell types and it can provide insight into the regulatory mechanisms. Reference-guided approach may facilitate the analysis of scCAS data by utilizing the information in existing datasets. We present RefTM (Reference-guided Topic Modeling of single-cell chromatin accessibility data), which not only utilizes the information in existing bulk chromatin accessibility and annotated scCAS data, but also takes advantage of topic models for single-cell data analysis. RefTM simultaneously models: (1) the shared biological variation among reference data and the target scCAS data; (2) the unique biological variation in scCAS data; (3) other variations from known covariates in scCAS data.
37039664	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Accurate and interpretable gene expression imputation on scRNA-seq data using IGSimpute.	Single-cell ribonucleic acid sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables the quantification of gene expression at the transcriptomic level with single-cell resolution, enhancing our understanding of cellular heterogeneity. However, the excessive missing values present in scRNA-seq data hinder downstream analysis. While numerous imputation methods have been proposed to recover scRNA-seq data, high imputation performance often comes with low or no interpretability. Here, we present IGSimpute, an accurate and interpretable imputation method for recovering missing values in scRNA-seq data with an interpretable instance-wise gene selection layer (GSL). IGSimpute outperforms 12 other state-of-the-art imputation methods on 13 out of 17 datasets from different scRNA-seq technologies with the lowest mean squared error as the chosen benchmark metric. We demonstrate that IGSimpute can give unbiased estimates of the missing values compared to other methods, regardless of whether the average gene expression values are small or large. Clustering results of imputed profiles show that IGSimpute offers statistically significant improvement over other imputation methods. By taking the heart-and-aorta and the limb muscle tissues as examples, we show that IGSimpute can also denoise gene expression profiles by removing outlier entries with unexpectedly high expression values via the instance-wise GSL. We also show that genes selected by the instance-wise GSL could indicate the age of B cells from bladder fat tissue of the Tabula Muris Senis atlas. IGSimpute can impute one million cells using 64 min, and thus applicable to large datasets.
31164141	2019	Genome biology	A practical guide to methods controlling false discoveries in computational biology.	BACKGROUND: In high-throughput studies, hundreds to millions of hypotheses are typically tested. Statistical methods that control the false discovery rate (FDR) have emerged as popular and powerful tools for error rate control. While classic FDR methods use only p values as input, more modern FDR methods have been shown to increase power by incorporating complementary information as informative covariates to prioritize, weight, and group hypotheses. However, there is currently no consensus on how the modern methods compare to one another. We investigate the accuracy, applicability, and ease of use of two classic and six modern FDR-controlling methods by performing a systematic benchmark comparison using simulation studies as well as six case studies in computational biology. RESULTS: Methods that incorporate informative covariates are modestly more powerful than classic approaches, and do not underperform classic approaches, even when the covariate is completely uninformative. The majority of methods are successful at controlling the FDR, with the exception of two modern methods under certain settings. Furthermore, we find that the improvement of the modern FDR methods over the classic methods increases with the informativeness of the covariate, total number of hypothesis tests, and proportion of truly non-null hypotheses. CONCLUSIONS: Modern FDR methods that use an informative covariate provide advantages over classic FDR-controlling procedures, with the relative gain dependent on the application and informativeness of available covariates. We present our findings as a practical guide and provide recommendations to aid researchers in their choice of methods to correct for false discoveries.
35061903	2022	Nucleic acids research	Benchmarking of a Bayesian single cell RNAseq differential gene expression test for dose-response study designs.	The application of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) for the evaluation of chemicals, drugs, and food contaminants presents the opportunity to consider cellular heterogeneity in pharmacological and toxicological responses. Current differential gene expression analysis (DGEA) methods focus primarily on two group comparisons, not multi-group dose-response study designs used in safety assessments. To benchmark DGEA methods for dose-response scRNAseq experiments, we proposed a multiplicity corrected Bayesian testing approach and compare it against 8 other methods including two frequentist fit-for-purpose tests using simulated and experimental data. Our Bayesian test method outperformed all other tests for a broad range of accuracy metrics including control of false positive error rates. Most notable, the fit-for-purpose and standard multiple group DGEA methods were superior to the two group scRNAseq methods for dose-response study designs. Collectively, our benchmarking of DGEA methods demonstrates the importance in considering study design when determining the most appropriate test methods.
29036714	2017	Nucleic acids research	Accounting for technical noise in differential expression analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data.	Recent technological breakthroughs have made it possible to measure RNA expression at the single-cell level, thus paving the way for exploring expression heterogeneity among individual cells. Current single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) protocols are complex and introduce technical biases that vary across cells, which can bias downstream analysis without proper adjustment. To account for cell-to-cell technical differences, we propose a statistical framework, TASC (Toolkit for Analysis of Single Cell RNA-seq), an empirical Bayes approach to reliably model the cell-specific dropout rates and amplification bias by use of external RNA spike-ins. TASC incorporates the technical parameters, which reflect cell-to-cell batch effects, into a hierarchical mixture model to estimate the biological variance of a gene and detect differentially expressed genes. More importantly, TASC is able to adjust for covariates to further eliminate confounding that may originate from cell size and cell cycle differences. In simulation and real scRNA-seq data, TASC achieves accurate Type I error control and displays competitive sensitivity and improved robustness to batch effects in differential expression analysis, compared to existing methods. TASC is programmed to be computationally efficient, taking advantage of multi-threaded parallelization. We believe that TASC will provide a robust platform for researchers to leverage the power of scRNA-seq.
40444783	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	DiSC: a statistical tool for fast differential expression analysis of individual-level single-cell RNA-seq data.	"MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become an important method for characterizing cellular heterogeneity, revealing more biological insights than the bulk RNA-seq. The surge in scRNA-seq data across multiple individuals calls for efficient and statistically powerful methods for differential expression (DE) analysis that addresses individual-level biological variability. RESULTS: We introduced DiSC, a method for conducting individual-level DE analysis by extracting multiple distributional characteristics, jointly testing their association with a variable of interest, and using a flexible permutation testing framework to control the false discovery rate (FDR). Our simulation studies demonstrated that DiSC effectively controlled the FDR across various settings and exhibited high statistical power in detecting different types of gene expression changes. Moreover, DiSC is computationally efficient and scalable to the rapidly increasing sample sizes in scRNA-seq studies. When applying DiSC to identify DE genes potentially associated with COVID-19 severity and Alzheimer's disease across various types of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and neural cells, we found that our method was approximately 100 times faster than other state-of-the-art methods and the results were consistent and supported by existing literature. While DiSC was developed for scRNA-seq data, its robust testing framework can also be applied to other types of single-cell data. We applied DiSC to cytometry by time-of-flight data, DiSC identified significantly more DE markers than traditional methods. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The R software package ""SingleCellStat"" is freely available on CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SingleCellStat/index.html) and GitHub (https://github.com/Lujun995/DiSC). The replication code for reproducing the analyses in this study is publicly accessible at https://github.com/Lujun995/DiSC_Replication_Code.

29523163	2018	Genome biology	Quartz-Seq2: a high-throughput single-cell RNA-sequencing method that effectively uses limited sequence reads.	High-throughput single-cell RNA-seq methods assign limited unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts as gene expression values to single cells from shallow sequence reads and detect limited gene counts. We thus developed a high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq method, Quartz-Seq2, to overcome these issues. Our improvements in the reaction steps make it possible to effectively convert initial reads to UMI counts, at a rate of 30-50%, and detect more genes. To demonstrate the power of Quartz-Seq2, we analyzed approximately 10,000 transcriptomes from in vitro embryonic stem cells and an in vivo stromal vascular fraction with a limited number of reads.
39656924	2025	Nucleic acids research	Bgee in 2024: focus on curated single-cell RNA-seq datasets, and query tools.	Bgee (https://www.bgee.org/) is a database to retrieve and compare gene expression patterns in multiple animal species. Expression data are integrated and made comparable between species thanks to consistent data annotation and processing. In the past years, we have integrated single-cell RNA-sequencing expression data into Bgee through careful curation of public datasets in multiple species. We have fully integrated this new technology along with the wealth of other data existing in Bgee. As a result, Bgee can now provide one definitive answer all the way to the cell resolution about a gene's expression pattern, comparable between species. We have updated our programmatic access tools to adapt to these changes accordingly. We have introduced a new web interface, providing detailed access to our annotations and expression data. It enables users to retrieve data, e.g. for specific organs, cell types or developmental stages, and leverages ontology reasoning to build powerful queries. Finally, we have expanded our species count from 29 to 52, emphasizing fish species critical for vertebrate genome studies, species of agronomic and veterinary importance and nonhuman primates.
40581982	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	DeepExDC interprets genomic compartmentalization changes in single-cell Hi-C data.	Single-cell Hi-C (scHi-C) technology enables probing of higher-order chromatin structures in individual cells. It provides an opportunity to get a deeper insight into genomic compartmentalization changes of single cells across different conditions, paving the way to a common understanding of the interplay among compartmental organization, genome functions, and cellular phenotypes. Unfortunately, there are only a few methods currently available for the differential analysis of A/B compartments on Hi-C data at the bulk level; the computational analysis of compartmentalization changes at the single-cell level is a field in its infancy. Herein, we propose DeepExDC, an interpretable 1D convolutional neural network for differential analysis of A/B compartments in scHi-C data on a genome-wide scale. It accepts Hi-C contact matrices at the single-cell level, runs without any distribution assumption and differential pattern limitation, and interprets genomic compartmentalization changes across multiple conditions. The results on simulated and experimental scHi-C data show that our DeepExDC has higher accuracies in detecting different types of compartmentalization changes, and the interpretation values are demonstrated to be able to reflect compartment changes across cell types. It is also observed that the differential compartments given by DeepExDC agree well with those by state-of-the-art methods at the bulk level, help to characterize heterogeneity of single cells, and exhibit a reasonable biological relevance in multiple regards. In addition, considering that DeepExDC is free of distribution assumptions and differential patterns, we attempted to transfer it onto scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data; it is interesting that our method also presents considerable power compared with the competing methods.
36733262	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	scGGAN: single-cell RNA-seq imputation by graph-based generative adversarial network.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data are typically with a large number of missing values, which often results in the loss of critical gene signaling information and seriously limit the downstream analysis. Deep learning-based imputation methods often can better handle scRNA-seq data than shallow ones, but most of them do not consider the inherent relations between genes, and the expression of a gene is often regulated by other genes. Therefore, it is essential to impute scRNA-seq data by considering the regional gene-to-gene relations. We propose a novel model (named scGGAN) to impute scRNA-seq data that learns the gene-to-gene relations by Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and global scRNA-seq data distribution by Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). scGGAN first leverages single-cell and bulk genomics data to explore inherent relations between genes and builds a more compact gene relation network to jointly capture the homogeneous and heterogeneous information. Then, it constructs a GCN-based GAN model to integrate the scRNA-seq, gene sequencing data and gene relation network for generating scRNA-seq data, and trains the model through adversarial learning. Finally, it utilizes data generated by the trained GCN-based GAN model to impute scRNA-seq data. Experiments on simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets show that scGGAN can effectively identify dropout events, recover the biologically meaningful expressions, determine subcellular states and types, improve the differential expression analysis and temporal dynamics analysis. Ablation experiments confirm that both the gene relation network and gene sequence data help the imputation of scRNA-seq data.
36151725	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	How does the structure of data impact cell-cell similarity? Evaluating how structural properties influence the performance of proximity metrics in single cell RNA-seq data.	Accurately identifying cell-populations is paramount to the quality of downstream analyses and overall interpretations of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) datasets but remains a challenge. The quality of single-cell clustering depends on the proximity metric used to generate cell-to-cell distances. Accordingly, proximity metrics have been benchmarked for scRNA-seq clustering, typically with results averaged across datasets to identify a highest performing metric. However, the 'best-performing' metric varies between studies, with the performance differing significantly between datasets. This suggests that the unique structural properties of an scRNA-seq dataset, specific to the biological system under study, have a substantial impact on proximity metric performance. Previous benchmarking studies have omitted to factor the structural properties into their evaluations. To address this gap, we developed a framework for the in-depth evaluation of the performance of 17 proximity metrics with respect to core structural properties of scRNA-seq data, including sparsity, dimensionality, cell-population distribution and rarity. We find that clustering performance can be improved substantially by the selection of an appropriate proximity metric and neighbourhood size for the structural properties of a dataset, in addition to performing suitable pre-processing and dimensionality reduction. Furthermore, popular metrics such as Euclidean and Manhattan distance performed poorly in comparison to several lessor applied metrics, suggesting that the default metric for many scRNA-seq methods should be re-evaluated. Our findings highlight the critical nature of tailoring scRNA-seq analyses pipelines to the dataset under study and provide practical guidance for researchers looking to optimize cell-similarity search for the structural properties of their own data.
38230824	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scMAE: a masked autoencoder for single-cell RNA-seq clustering.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing has emerged as a powerful technology for studying gene expression at the individual cell level. Clustering individual cells into distinct subpopulations is fundamental in scRNA-seq data analysis, facilitating the identification of cell types and exploration of cellular heterogeneity. Despite the recent development of many deep learning-based single-cell clustering methods, few have effectively exploited the correlations among genes, resulting in suboptimal clustering outcomes. RESULTS: Here, we propose a novel masked autoencoder-based method, scMAE, for cell clustering. scMAE perturbs gene expression and employs a masked autoencoder to reconstruct the original data, learning robust and informative cell representations. The masked autoencoder introduces a masking predictor, which captures relationships among genes by predicting whether gene expression values are masked. By integrating this masking mechanism, scMAE effectively captures latent structures and dependencies in the data, enhancing clustering performance. We conducted extensive comparative experiments using various clustering evaluation metrics on 15 scRNA-seq datasets from different sequencing platforms. Experimental results indicate that scMAE outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on these datasets. In addition, scMAE accurately identifies rare cell types, which are challenging to detect due to their low abundance. Furthermore, biological analyses confirm the biological significance of the identified cell subpopulations. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code of scMAE is available at: https://zenodo.org/records/10465991.
26887813	2016	Genome biology	Classification of low quality cells from single-cell RNA-seq data.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has broad applications across biomedical research. One of the key challenges is to ensure that only single, live cells are included in downstream analysis, as the inclusion of compromised cells inevitably affects data interpretation. Here, we present a generic approach for processing scRNA-seq data and detecting low quality cells, using a curated set of over 20 biological and technical features. Our approach improves classification accuracy by over 30 % compared to traditional methods when tested on over 5,000 cells, including CD4+ T cells, bone marrow dendritic cells, and mouse embryonic stem cells.
30462277	2019	Nucleic acids research	scFTD-seq: freeze-thaw lysis based, portable approach toward highly distributed single-cell 3' mRNA profiling.	Cellular barcoding of 3' mRNAs enabled massively parallel profiling of single-cell gene expression and has been implemented in droplet and microwell based platforms. The latter further adds the value for compatibility with low input samples, optical imaging, scalability, and portability. However, cell lysis in microwells remains challenging despite the recently developed sophisticated solutions. Here, we present scFTD-seq, a microchip platform for performing single-cell freeze-thaw lysis directly toward 3' mRNA sequencing. It offers format flexibility with a simplified, widely adoptable workflow that reduces the number of preparation steps and hands-on time, with the quality of data and cost per sample matching that of the state-of-the-art scRNA-seq platforms. Freeze-thaw, known as an unfavorable lysis method resulting in possible RNA fragmentation, turns out to be fully compatible with 3' scRNA-seq. We applied it to the profiling of circulating follicular helper T cells implicated in systemic lupus erythematosus pathogenesis. Our results delineate the heterogeneity in the transcriptional programs and effector functions of these rare pathogenic T cells. As scFTD-seq decouples on-chip cell isolation and library preparation, we envision it to allow sampling at the distributed sites including point-of-care settings and downstream processing at centralized facilities, which should enable wide-spread adoption beyond academic laboratories.
29921301	2018	Genome biology	dropEst: pipeline for accurate estimation of molecular counts in droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq experiments.	Recent single-cell RNA-seq protocols based on droplet microfluidics use massively multiplexed barcoding to enable simultaneous measurements of transcriptomes for thousands of individual cells. The increasing complexity of such data creates challenges for subsequent computational processing and troubleshooting of these experiments, with few software options currently available. Here, we describe a flexible pipeline for processing droplet-based transcriptome data that implements barcode corrections, classification of cell quality, and diagnostic information about the droplet libraries. We introduce advanced methods for correcting composition bias and sequencing errors affecting cellular and molecular barcodes to provide more accurate estimates of molecular counts in individual cells.
36585784	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Evaluation of single-cell RNAseq labelling algorithms using cancer datasets.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) clustering and labelling methods are used to determine precise cellular composition of tissue samples. Automated labelling methods rely on either unsupervised, cluster-based approaches or supervised, cell-based approaches to identify cell types. The high complexity of cancer poses a unique challenge, as tumor microenvironments are often composed of diverse cell subpopulations with unique functional effects that may lead to disease progression, metastasis and treatment resistance. Here, we assess 17 cell-based and 9 cluster-based scRNA-seq labelling algorithms using 8 cancer datasets, providing a comprehensive large-scale assessment of such methods in a cancer-specific context. Using several performance metrics, we show that cell-based methods generally achieved higher performance and were faster compared to cluster-based methods. Cluster-based methods more successfully labelled non-malignant cell types, likely because of a lack of gene signatures for relevant malignant cell subpopulations. Larger cell numbers present in some cell types in training data positively impacted prediction scores for cell-based methods. Finally, we examined which methods performed favorably when trained and tested on separate patient cohorts in scenarios similar to clinical applications, and which were able to accurately label particularly small or under-represented cell populations in the given datasets. We conclude that scPred and SVM show the best overall performances with cancer-specific data and provide further suggestions for algorithm selection. Our analysis pipeline for assessing the performance of cell type labelling algorithms is available in https://github.com/shooshtarilab/scRNAseq-Automated-Cell-Type-Labelling.
32365169	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scDoc: correcting drop-out events in single-cell RNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become an important tool to unravel cellular heterogeneity, discover new cell (sub)types, and understand cell development at single-cell resolution. However, one major challenge to scRNA-seq research is the presence of 'drop-out' events, which usually is due to extremely low mRNA input or the stochastic nature of gene expression. In this article, we present a novel single-cell RNA-seq drop-out correction (scDoc) method, imputing drop-out events by borrowing information for the same gene from highly similar cells. RESULTS: scDoc is the first method that directly involves drop-out information to accounting for cell-to-cell similarity estimation, which is crucial in scRNA-seq drop-out imputation but has not been appropriately examined. We evaluated the performance of scDoc using both simulated data and real scRNA-seq studies. Results show that scDoc outperforms the existing imputation methods in reference to data visualization, cell subpopulation identification and differential expression detection in scRNA-seq data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: R code is available at https://github.com/anlingUA/scDoc. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
36414416	2023	Genome research	Marker-free characterization of full-length transcriptomes of single live circulating tumor cells.	The identification and characterization of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are important for gaining insights into the biology of metastatic cancers, monitoring disease progression, and medical management of the disease. The limiting factor in the enrichment of purified CTC populations is their sparse availability, heterogeneity, and altered phenotypes relative to the primary tumor. Intensive research both at the technical and molecular fronts led to the development of assays that ease CTC detection and identification from peripheral blood. Most CTC detection methods based on single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) use a mix of size selection, marker-based white blood cell (WBC) depletion, and antibodies targeting tumor-associated antigens. However, the majority of these methods either miss out on atypical CTCs or suffer from WBC contamination. We present unCTC, an R package for unbiased identification and characterization of CTCs from single-cell transcriptomic data. unCTC features many standard and novel computational and statistical modules for various analyses. These include a novel method of scRNA-seq clustering, named deep dictionary learning using k-means clustering cost (DDLK), expression-based copy number variation (CNV) inference, and combinatorial, marker-based verification of the malignant phenotypes. DDLK enables robust segregation of CTCs and WBCs in the pathway space, as opposed to the gene expression space. We validated the utility of unCTC on scRNA-seq profiles of breast CTCs from six patients, captured and profiled using an integrated ClearCell FX and Polaris workflow that works by the principles of size-based separation of CTCs and marker-based WBC depletion.
39313646	2025	Nature biotechnology	Coordinated, multicellular patterns of transcriptional variation that stratify patient cohorts are revealed by tensor decomposition.	Tissue-level and organism-level biological processes often involve the coordinated action of multiple distinct cell types. The recent application of single-cell assays to many individuals should enable the study of how donor-level variation in one cell type is linked to that in other cell types. Here we introduce a computational approach called single-cell interpretable tensor decomposition (scITD) to identify common axes of interindividual variation by considering joint expression variation across multiple cell types. scITD combines expression matrices from each cell type into a higher-order matrix and factorizes the result using the Tucker tensor decomposition. Applying scITD to single-cell RNA-sequencing data on 115 persons with lupus and 83 persons with coronavirus disease 2019, we identify patterns of coordinated cellular activity linked to disease severity and specific phenotypes, such as lupus nephritis. scITD results also implicate specific signaling pathways likely mediating coordination between cell types. Overall, scITD offers a tool for understanding the covariation of cell states across individuals, which can yield insights into the complex processes that define and stratify disease.
32840568	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Systematic determination of the mitochondrial proportion in human and mice tissues for single-cell RNA-sequencing data quality control.	MOTIVATION: Quality control (QC) is a critical step in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data analysis. Low-quality cells are removed from the analysis during the QC process to avoid misinterpretation of the data. An important QC metric is the mitochondrial proportion (mtDNA%), which is used as a threshold to filter out low-quality cells. Early publications in the field established a threshold of 5% and since then, it has been used as a default in several software packages for scRNA-seq data analysis, and adopted as a standard in many scRNA-seq studies. However, the validity of using a uniform threshold across different species, single-cell technologies, tissues and cell types has not been adequately assessed. RESULTS: We systematically analyzed 5 530 106 cells reported in 1349 annotated datasets available in the PanglaoDB database and found that the average mtDNA% in scRNA-seq data across human tissues is significantly higher than in mouse tissues. This difference is not confounded by the platform used to generate the data. Based on this finding, we propose new reference values of the mtDNA% for 121 tissues of mouse and 44 tissues of humans. In general, for mouse tissues, the 5% threshold performs well to distinguish between healthy and low-quality cells. However, for human tissues, the 5% threshold should be reconsidered as it fails to accurately discriminate between healthy and low-quality cells in 29.5% (13 of 44) tissues analyzed. We conclude that omitting the mtDNA% QC filter or adopting a suboptimal mtDNA% threshold may lead to erroneous biological interpretations of scRNA-seq data. AVAILABILITYAND IMPLEMENTATION: The code used to download datasets, perform the analyzes and produce the figures is available at https://github.com/dosorio/mtProportion. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
35157031	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Optimal transport improves cell-cell similarity inference in single-cell omics data.	MOTIVATION: High-throughput single-cell molecular profiling is revolutionizing biology and medicine by unveiling the diversity of cell types and states contributing to development and disease. The identification and characterization of cellular heterogeneity are typically achieved through unsupervised clustering, which crucially relies on a similarity metric. RESULTS: We here propose the use of Optimal Transport (OT) as a cell-cell similarity metric for single-cell omics data. OT defines distances to compare high-dimensional data represented as probability distributions. To speed up computations and cope with the high dimensionality of single-cell data, we consider the entropic regularization of the classical OT distance. We then extensively benchmark OT against state-of-the-art metrics over 13 independent datasets, including simulated, scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq and single-cell DNA methylation data. First, we test the ability of the metrics to detect the similarity between cells belonging to the same groups (e.g. cell types, cell lines of origin). Then, we apply unsupervised clustering and test the quality of the resulting clusters. OT is found to improve cell-cell similarity inference and cell clustering in all simulated and real scRNA-seq data, as well as in scATAC-seq and single-cell DNA methylation data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: All our analyses are reproducible through the OT-scOmics Jupyter notebook available at https://github.com/ComputationalSystemsBiology/OT-scOmics. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
35799304	2022	Genome biology	scSTEM: clustering pseudotime ordered single-cell data.	We develop scSTEM, single-cell STEM, a method for clustering dynamic profiles of genes in trajectories inferred from pseudotime ordering of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data. scSTEM uses one of several metrics to summarize the expression of genes and assigns a p-value to clusters enabling the identification of significant profiles and comparison of profiles across different paths. Application of scSTEM to several scRNA-seq datasets demonstrates its usefulness and ability to improve downstream analysis of biological processes. scSTEM is available at https://github.com/alexQiSong/scSTEM .
37935617	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	FEED: a feature selection method based on gene expression decomposition for single cell clustering.	Single-cell clustering is a critical step in biological downstream analysis. The clustering performance could be effectively improved by extracting cell-type-specific genes. The state-of-the-art feature selection methods usually calculate the importance of a single gene without considering the information contained in the gene expression distribution. Moreover, these methods ignore the intrinsic expression patterns of genes and heterogeneity within groups of different mean expression levels. In this work, we present a Feature sElection method based on gene Expression Decomposition (FEED) of scRNA-seq data, which selects informative genes to enhance clustering performance. First, the expression levels of genes are decomposed into multiple Gaussian components. Then, a novel gene correlation calculation method is proposed to measure the relationship between genes from the perspective of distribution. Finally, a permutation-based approach is proposed to determine the threshold of gene importance to obtain marker gene subsets. Compared with state-of-the-art feature selection methods, applying FEED on various scRNA-seq datasets including large datasets followed by different common clustering algorithms results in significant improvements in the accuracy of cell-type identification. The source codes for FEED are freely available at https://github.com/genemine/FEED.
33674351	2021	Genome research	Modeling expression ranks for noise-tolerant differential expression analysis of scRNA-seq data.	Systematic delineation of complex biological systems is an ever-challenging and resource-intensive process. Single-cell transcriptomics allows us to study cell-to-cell variability in complex tissues at an unprecedented resolution. Accurate modeling of gene expression plays a critical role in the statistical determination of tissue-specific gene expression patterns. In the past few years, considerable efforts have been made to identify appropriate parametric models for single-cell expression data. The zero-inflated version of Poisson/negative binomial and log-normal distributions have emerged as the most popular alternatives owing to their ability to accommodate high dropout rates, as commonly observed in single-cell data. Although the majority of the parametric approaches directly model expression estimates, we explore the potential of modeling expression ranks, as robust surrogates for transcript abundance. Here we examined the performance of the discrete generalized beta distribution (DGBD) on real data and devised a Wald-type test for comparing gene expression across two phenotypically divergent groups of single cells. We performed a comprehensive assessment of the proposed method to understand its advantages compared with some of the existing best-practice approaches. We concluded that besides striking a reasonable balance between Type I and Type II errors, ROSeq, the proposed differential expression test, is exceptionally robust to expression noise and scales rapidly with increasing sample size. For wider dissemination and adoption of the method, we created an R package called ROSeq and made it available on the Bioconductor platform.
37907328	2023	Genome research	Infernape uncovers cell type-specific and spatially resolved alternative polyadenylation in the brain.	Differential polyadenylation sites (PAs) critically regulate gene expression, but their cell type-specific usage and spatial distribution in the brain have not been systematically characterized. Here, we present Infernape, which infers and quantifies PA usage from single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data and show its application in the mouse brain. Infernape uncovers alternative intronic PAs and 3'-UTR lengthening during cortical neurogenesis. Progenitor-neuron comparisons in the excitatory and inhibitory neuron lineages show overlapping PA changes in embryonic brains, suggesting that the neural proliferation-differentiation axis plays a prominent role. In the adult mouse brain, we uncover cell type-specific PAs and visualize such events using spatial transcriptomic data.

36197936	2022	PLoS computational biology	Scalable workflow for characterization of cell-cell communication in COVID-19 patients.	COVID-19 patients display a wide range of disease severity, ranging from asymptomatic to critical symptoms with high mortality risk. Our ability to understand the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells within the lung, and of protective or dysfunctional immune responses to the virus, is critical to effectively treat these patients. Currently, our understanding of cell-cell interactions across different disease states, and how such interactions may drive pathogenic outcomes, is incomplete. Here, we developed a generalizable and scalable workflow for identifying cells that are differentially interacting across COVID-19 patients with distinct disease outcomes and use this to examine eight public single-cell RNA-seq datasets (six from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, one from bronchoalveolar lavage and one from nasopharyngeal), with a total of 211 individual samples. By characterizing the cell-cell interaction patterns across epithelial and immune cells in lung tissues for patients with varying disease severity, we illustrate diverse communication patterns across individuals, and discover heterogeneous communication patterns among moderate and severe patients. We further illustrate patterns derived from cell-cell interactions are potential signatures for discriminating between moderate and severe patients. Overall, this workflow can be generalized and scaled to combine multiple scRNA-seq datasets to uncover cell-cell interactions.
38279647	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	SPANN: annotating single-cell resolution spatial transcriptome data with scRNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: The rapid development of spatial transcriptome technologies has enabled researchers to acquire single-cell-level spatial data at an affordable price. However, computational analysis tools, such as annotation tools, tailored for these data are still lacking. Recently, many computational frameworks have emerged to integrate single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics datasets. While some frameworks can utilize well-annotated scRNA-seq data to annotate spatial expression patterns, they overlook critical aspects. First, existing tools do not explicitly consider cell type mapping when aligning the two modalities. Second, current frameworks lack the capability to detect novel cells, which remains a key interest for biologists. RESULTS: To address these problems, we propose an annotation method for spatial transcriptome data called SPANN. The main tasks of SPANN are to transfer cell-type labels from well-annotated scRNA-seq data to newly generated single-cell resolution spatial transcriptome data and discover novel cells from spatial data. The major innovations of SPANN come from two aspects: SPANN automatically detects novel cells from unseen cell types while maintaining high annotation accuracy over known cell types. SPANN finds a mapping between spatial transcriptome samples and RNA data prototypes and thus conducts cell-type-level alignment. Comprehensive experiments using datasets from various spatial platforms demonstrate SPANN's capabilities in annotating known cell types and discovering novel cell states within complex tissue contexts.

39134412	2024	Genome research	A gene regulatory network-aware graph learning method for cell identity annotation in single-cell RNA-seq data.	Cell identity annotation for single-cell transcriptome data is a crucial process for constructing cell atlases, unraveling pathogenesis, and inspiring therapeutic approaches. Currently, the efficacy of existing methodologies is contingent upon specific data sets. Nevertheless, such data are often sourced from various batches, sequencing technologies, tissues, and even species. Notably, the gene regulatory relationship remains unaffected by the aforementioned factors, highlighting the extensive gene interactions within organisms. Therefore, we propose scHGR, an automated annotation tool designed to leverage gene regulatory relationships in constructing gene-mediated cell communication graphs for single-cell transcriptome data. This strategy helps reduce noise from diverse data sources while establishing distant cellular connections, yielding valuable biological insights. Experiments involving 22 scenarios demonstrate that scHGR precisely and consistently annotates cell identities, benchmarked against state-of-the-art methods. Crucially, scHGR uncovers novel subtypes within peripheral blood mononuclear cells, specifically from CD4(+) T cells and cytotoxic T cells. Furthermore, by characterizing a cell atlas comprising 56 cell types for COVID-19 patients, scHGR identifies vital factors like IL1 and calcium ions, offering insights for targeted therapeutic interventions.

34864918	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	HDMC: a novel deep learning-based framework for removing batch effects in single-cell RNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: With the development of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) techniques, increasingly more large-scale gene expression datasets become available. However, to analyze datasets produced by different experiments, batch effects among different datasets must be considered. Although several methods have been recently published to remove batch effects in scRNA-seq data, two problems remain to be challenging and not completely solved: (i) how to reduce the distribution differences of different batches more accurately; and (ii) how to align samples from different batches to recover the cell type clusters. RESULTS: We proposed a novel deep-learning approach, which is a hierarchical distribution-matching framework assisted with contrastive learning to address these two problems. Firstly, we design a hierarchical framework for distribution matching based on a deep autoencoder. This framework employs an adversarial training strategy to match the global distribution of different batches. This provides an improved foundation to further match the local distributions with a maximum mean discrepancy-based loss. For local matching, we divide cells in each batch into clusters and develop a contrastive learning mechanism to simultaneously align similar cluster pairs and keep noisy pairs apart from each other. This allows to obtain clusters with all cells of the same type (true positives), and avoid clusters with cells of different type (false positives). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both simulated and real datasets. Results show that our new method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and has the ability to prevent overcorrection. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The python code to generate results and figures in this article is available at https://github.com/zhanglabNKU/HDMC, the data underlying this article is also available at this github repository.

41283813	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Single-cell omics arena: evaluation of large language models for automatic cell-type annotations on single-cell omics data via RNA-seq bridging.	The single-cell sequencing revolution enables simultaneous molecular profiling of various modalities across thousands of individual cells, allowing scientists to investigate the diverse functions of complex tissues. Among all the analysis steps, assigning individual cells to specific types is fundamental for understanding cellular heterogeneity. However, this process is labor-intensive and requires extensive expert knowledge. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their ability to automatically extract biological knowledge, such as marker genes, promoting efficient, and automated cell-type annotations. To evaluate the capability of modern LLMs in automating the cell-type identification process, we first introduce an automated cell-type annotation method with comprehensive benchmark: Single-cell Omics Arena). Specifically, we began by compiling 11 publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets and evaluating eight LLMs across 1226 cell-type annotation-related tasks. This effort established a foundation for automated cell-type annotation from scRNA-seq data using interpretable features such as gene names. Building upon this benchmark, we introduced domain-specific chain-of-thought prompting techniques to enhance the accuracy of cell-type annotation and facilitate the extraction of relevant biological insights. Finally, to accommodate non-interpretable features, we proposed to leverage a pretrained VAE-based cross-modality translation module to convert features such as epigenetic marks into interpretable representations, which enables the seamless extension of LLM-based cell-type annotation to non-RNA-based sequencing technologies. In summary, our benchmark provides key insights into automated cell-type annotation from scRNA-seq data and demonstrates the potential of cross-modality translation for handling non-interpretable features.
37985457	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Predicting gene regulatory links from single-cell RNA-seq data using graph neural networks.	Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful technique for studying gene expression patterns at the single-cell level. Inferring gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from scRNA-seq data provides insight into cellular phenotypes from the genomic level. However, the high sparsity, noise and dropout events inherent in scRNA-seq data present challenges for GRN inference. In recent years, the dramatic increase in data on experimentally validated transcription factors binding to DNA has made it possible to infer GRNs by supervised methods. In this study, we address the problem of GRN inference by framing it as a graph link prediction task. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called GNNLink, which leverages known GRNs to deduce the potential regulatory interdependencies between genes. First, we preprocess the raw scRNA-seq data. Then, we introduce a graph convolutional network-based interaction graph encoder to effectively refine gene features by capturing interdependencies between nodes in the network. Finally, the inference of GRN is obtained by performing matrix completion operation on node features. The features obtained from model training can be applied to downstream tasks such as measuring similarity and inferring causality between gene pairs. To evaluate the performance of GNNLink, we compare it with six existing GRN reconstruction methods using seven scRNA-seq datasets. These datasets encompass diverse ground truth networks, including functional interaction networks, Loss of Function/Gain of Function data, non-specific ChIP-seq data and cell-type-specific ChIP-seq data. Our experimental results demonstrate that GNNLink achieves comparable or superior performance across these datasets, showcasing its robustness and accuracy. Furthermore, we observe consistent performance across datasets of varying scales. For reproducibility, we provide the data and source code of GNNLink on our GitHub repository: https://github.com/sdesignates/GNNLink.
40327499	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scACCorDiON: a clustering approach for explainable patient level cell-cell communication graph analysis.	MOTIVATION: Combining single-cell sequencing with ligand-receptor (LR) analysis paves the way for the characterization of cell communication events in complex tissues. In particular, directed weighted graphs naturally represent cell-cell communication events. However, current computational methods cannot yet analyze sample-specific cell-cell communication events, as measured in single-cell data produced in large patient cohorts. Cohort-based cell-cell communication analysis presents many challenges, such as the nonlinear nature of cell-cell communication and the high variability given by the patient-specific single-cell RNAseq datasets. RESULTS: Here, we present scACCorDiON (single-cell Analysis of Cell-Cell Communication in Disease clusters using Optimal transport in Directed Networks), an optimal transport algorithm exploring node distances on the Markov Chain as the ground metric between directed weighted graphs. Benchmarking indicates that scACCorDiON performs a better clustering of samples according to their disease status than competing methods that use undirected graphs. We provide a case study of pancreas adenocarcinoma, where scACCorDion detects a sub-cluster of disease samples associated with changes in the tumor microenvironment. Our study case corroborates that clusters provide a robust and explainable representation of cell-cell communication events and that the expression of detected LR pairs is predictive of pancreatic cancer survival. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The code of scACCorDiON is available at https://scaccordion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15267648.

33795888	2021	Nature biotechnology	Modular, efficient and constant-memory single-cell RNA-seq preprocessing.	We describe a workflow for preprocessing of single-cell RNA-sequencing data that balances efficiency and accuracy. Our workflow is based on the kallisto and bustools programs, and is near optimal in speed with a constant memory requirement providing scalability for arbitrarily large datasets. The workflow is modular, and we demonstrate its flexibility by showing how it can be used for RNA velocity analyses.
34452629	2021	Genome biology	BRIE2: computational identification of splicing phenotypes from single-cell transcriptomic experiments.	RNA splicing is an important driver of heterogeneity in single cells through the expression of alternative transcripts and as a determinant of transcriptional kinetics. However, the intrinsic coverage limitations of scRNA-seq technologies make it challenging to associate specific splicing events to cell-level phenotypes. BRIE2 is a scalable computational method that resolves these issues by regressing single-cell transcriptomic data against cell-level features. We show that BRIE2 effectively identifies differential disease-associated alternative splicing events and allows a principled selection of genes that capture heterogeneity in transcriptional kinetics and improve RNA velocity analyses, enabling the identification of splicing phenotypes associated with biological changes.
34138847	2021	PLoS computational biology	SDImpute: A statistical block imputation method based on cell-level and gene-level information for dropouts in single-cell RNA-seq data.	The single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies obtain gene expression at single-cell resolution and provide a tool for exploring cell heterogeneity and cell types. As the low amount of extracted mRNA copies per cell, scRNA-seq data exhibit a large number of dropouts, which hinders the downstream analysis of the scRNA-seq data. We propose a statistical method, SDImpute (Single-cell RNA-seq Dropout Imputation), to implement block imputation for dropout events in scRNA-seq data. SDImpute automatically identifies the dropout events based on the gene expression levels and the variations of gene expression across similar cells and similar genes, and it implements block imputation for dropouts by utilizing gene expression unaffected by dropouts from similar cells. In the experiments, the results of the simulated datasets and real datasets suggest that SDImpute is an effective tool to recover the data and preserve the heterogeneity of gene expression across cells. Compared with the state-of-the-art imputation methods, SDImpute improves the accuracy of the downstream analysis including clustering, visualization, and differential expression analysis.
37497729	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	AtacAnnoR: a reference-based annotation tool for single cell ATAC-seq data.	Here, we present AtacAnnoR, a two-round annotation method for scATAC-seq data using well-annotated scRNA-seq data as reference. We evaluate AtacAnnoR's performance against six competing methods on 11 benchmark datasets. Our results show that AtacAnnoR achieves the highest mean accuracy and the highest mean balanced accuracy and performs particularly well when unpaired scRNA-seq data are used as the reference. Furthermore, AtacAnnoR implements a 'Combine and Discard' strategy to further improve annotation accuracy when annotations of multiple references are available. AtacAnnoR has been implemented in an R package and can be directly integrated into currently popular scATAC-seq analysis pipelines.
38600665	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	scINRB: single-cell gene expression imputation with network regularization and bulk RNA-seq data.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) facilitates the study of cell type heterogeneity and the construction of cell atlas. However, due to its limitations, many genes may be detected to have zero expressions, i.e. dropout events, leading to bias in downstream analyses and hindering the identification and characterization of cell types and cell functions. Although many imputation methods have been developed, their performances are generally lower than expected across different kinds and dimensions of data and application scenarios. Therefore, developing an accurate and robust single-cell gene expression data imputation method is still essential. Considering to maintain the original cell-cell and gene-gene correlations and leverage bulk RNA sequencing (bulk RNA-seq) data information, we propose scINRB, a single-cell gene expression imputation method with network regularization and bulk RNA-seq data. scINRB adopts network-regularized non-negative matrix factorization to ensure that the imputed data maintains the cell-cell and gene-gene similarities and also approaches the gene average expression calculated from bulk RNA-seq data. To evaluate the performance, we test scINRB on simulated and experimental datasets and compare it with other commonly used imputation methods. The results show that scINRB recovers gene expression accurately even in the case of high dropout rates and dimensions, preserves cell-cell and gene-gene similarities and improves various downstream analyses including visualization, clustering and trajectory inference.
35253896	2022	Nucleic acids research	STRIDE: accurately decomposing and integrating spatial transcriptomics using single-cell RNA sequencing.	The recent advances in spatial transcriptomics have brought unprecedented opportunities to understand the cellular heterogeneity in the spatial context. However, the current limitations of spatial technologies hamper the exploration of cellular localizations and interactions at single-cell level. Here, we present spatial transcriptomics deconvolution by topic modeling (STRIDE), a computational method to decompose cell types from spatial mixtures by leveraging topic profiles trained from single-cell transcriptomics. STRIDE accurately estimated the cell-type proportions and showed balanced specificity and sensitivity compared to existing methods. We demonstrated STRIDE's utility by applying it to different spatial platforms and biological systems. Deconvolution by STRIDE not only mapped rare cell types to spatial locations but also improved the identification of spatially localized genes and domains. Moreover, topics discovered by STRIDE were associated with cell-type-specific functions and could be further used to integrate successive sections and reconstruct the three-dimensional architecture of tissues. Taken together, STRIDE is a versatile and extensible tool for integrated analysis of spatial and single-cell transcriptomics and is publicly available at https://github.com/wanglabtongji/STRIDE.
33106178	2020	Genome biology	RNA editing in cancer impacts mRNA abundance in immune response pathways.	BACKGROUND: RNA editing generates modifications to the RNA sequences, thereby increasing protein diversity and shaping various layers of gene regulation. Recent studies have revealed global shifts in editing levels across many cancer types, as well as a few specific mechanisms implicating individual sites in tumorigenesis or metastasis. However, most tumor-associated sites, predominantly in noncoding regions, have unknown functional relevance. RESULTS: Here, we carry out integrative analysis of RNA editing profiles between epithelial and mesenchymal tumors, since epithelial-mesenchymal transition is a key paradigm for metastasis. We identify distinct editing patterns between epithelial and mesenchymal tumors in seven cancer types using TCGA data, an observation further supported by single-cell RNA sequencing data and ADAR perturbation experiments in cell culture. Through computational analyses and experimental validations, we show that differential editing sites between epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes function by regulating mRNA abundance of their respective genes. Our analysis of RNA-binding proteins reveals ILF3 as a potential regulator of this process, supported by experimental validations. Consistent with the known roles of ILF3 in immune response, epithelial-mesenchymal differential editing sites are enriched in genes involved in immune and viral processes. The strongest target of editing-dependent ILF3 regulation is the transcript encoding PKR, a crucial player in immune and viral response. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reports widespread differences in RNA editing between epithelial and mesenchymal tumors and a novel mechanism of editing-dependent regulation of mRNA abundance. It reveals the broad impact of RNA editing in cancer and its relevance to cancer-related immune pathways.
38490248	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	ICELLNET v2: a versatile method for cell-cell communication analysis from human transcriptomic data.	SUMMARY: Several methods have been developed in the past years to infer cell-cell communication networks from transcriptomic data based on ligand and receptor expression. Among them, ICELLNET is one of the few approaches to consider the multiple subunits of ligands and receptors complexes to infer and quantify cell communication. In here, we present a major update of ICELLNET. As compared to its original implementation, we (i) drastically expanded the ICELLNET ligand-receptor database from 380 to 1669 biologically curated interactions, (ii) integrated important families of communication molecules involved in immune crosstalk, cell adhesion, and Wnt pathway, (iii) optimized ICELLNET framework for single-cell RNA sequencing data analyses, (iv) provided new visualizations of cell-cell communication results to facilitate prioritization and biological interpretation. This update will broaden the use of ICELLNET by the scientific community in different biological fields. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: ICELLNET package is implemented in R. Source code, documentation and tutorials are available on GitHub (https://github.com/soumelis-lab/ICELLNET).
33603203	2022	Nature biotechnology	Robust decomposition of cell type mixtures in spatial transcriptomics.	A limitation of spatial transcriptomics technologies is that individual measurements may contain contributions from multiple cells, hindering the discovery of cell-type-specific spatial patterns of localization and expression. Here, we develop robust cell type decomposition (RCTD), a computational method that leverages cell type profiles learned from single-cell RNA-seq to decompose cell type mixtures while correcting for differences across sequencing technologies. We demonstrate the ability of RCTD to detect mixtures and identify cell types on simulated datasets. Furthermore, RCTD accurately reproduces known cell type and subtype localization patterns in Slide-seq and Visium datasets of the mouse brain. Finally, we show how RCTD's recovery of cell type localization enables the discovery of genes within a cell type whose expression depends on spatial environment. Spatial mapping of cell types with RCTD enables the spatial components of cellular identity to be defined, uncovering new principles of cellular organization in biological tissue. RCTD is publicly available as an open-source R package at https://github.com/dmcable/RCTD .
23360624	2013	Genome biology	Inferring the kinetics of stochastic gene expression from single-cell RNA-sequencing data.	BACKGROUND: Genetically identical populations of cells grown in the same environmental condition show substantial variability in gene expression profiles. Although single-cell RNA-seq provides an opportunity to explore this phenomenon, statistical methods need to be developed to interpret the variability of gene expression counts. RESULTS: We develop a statistical framework for studying the kinetics of stochastic gene expression from single-cell RNA-seq data. By applying our model to a single-cell RNA-seq dataset generated by profiling mouse embryonic stem cells, we find that the inferred kinetic parameters are consistent with RNA polymerase II binding and chromatin modifications. Our results suggest that histone modifications affect transcriptional bursting by modulating both burst size and frequency. Furthermore, we show that our model can be used to identify genes with slow promoter kinetics, which are important for probabilistic differentiation of embryonic stem cells. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the proposed statistical model provides a flexible and efficient way to investigate the kinetics of transcription.
32854757	2020	Genome biology	A systematic evaluation of single-cell RNA-sequencing imputation methods.	BACKGROUND: The rapid development of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies has led to the emergence of many methods for removing systematic technical noises, including imputation methods, which aim to address the increased sparsity observed in single-cell data. Although many imputation methods have been developed, there is no consensus on how methods compare to each other. RESULTS: Here, we perform a systematic evaluation of 18 scRNA-seq imputation methods to assess their accuracy and usability. We benchmark these methods in terms of the similarity between imputed cell profiles and bulk samples and whether these methods recover relevant biological signals or introduce spurious noise in downstream differential expression, unsupervised clustering, and pseudotemporal trajectory analyses, as well as their computational run time, memory usage, and scalability. Methods are evaluated using data from both cell lines and tissues and from both plate- and droplet-based single-cell platforms. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the majority of scRNA-seq imputation methods outperformed no imputation in recovering gene expression observed in bulk RNA-seq. However, the majority of the methods did not improve performance in downstream analyses compared to no imputation, in particular for clustering and trajectory analysis, and thus should be used with caution. In addition, we found substantial variability in the performance of the methods within each evaluation aspect. Overall, MAGIC, kNN-smoothing, and SAVER were found to outperform the other methods most consistently.
36243973	2023	Nucleic acids research	PertOrg 1.0: a comprehensive resource of multilevel alterations induced in model organisms by in vivo genetic perturbation.	Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) can be generated to model human genetic disease or plant disease resistance, and they have contributed to the exploration and understanding of gene function, physiology, disease onset and drug target discovery. Here, PertOrg (http://www.inbirg.com/pertorg/) was introduced to provide multilevel alterations in GMOs. Raw data of 58 707 transcriptome profiles and associated information, such as phenotypic alterations, were collected and curated from studies involving in vivo genetic perturbation (e.g. knockdown, knockout and overexpression) in eight model organisms, including mouse, rat and zebrafish. The transcriptome profiles from before and after perturbation were organized into 10 116 comparison datasets, including 122 single-cell RNA-seq datasets. The raw data were checked and analysed using widely accepted and standardized pipelines to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in perturbed organisms. As a result, 8 644 148 DEGs were identified and deposited as signatures of gene perturbations. Downstream functional enrichment analysis, cell type analysis and phenotypic alterations were also provided when available. Multiple search methods and analytical tools were created and implemented. Furthermore, case studies were presented to demonstrate how users can utilize the database. PertOrg 1.0 will be a valuable resource aiding in the exploration of gene functions, biological processes and disease models.
34037706	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	HelPredictor models single-cell transcriptome to predict human embryo lineage allocation.	The in-depth understanding of cellular fate decision of human preimplantation embryos has prompted investigations on how changes in lineage allocation, which is far from trivial and remains a time-consuming task by experimental methods. It is desirable to develop a novel effective bioinformatics strategy to consider transitions of coordinated embryo lineage allocation and stage-specific patterns. There are rapidly growing applications of machine learning models to interpret complex datasets for identifying candidate development-related factors and lineage-determining molecular events. Here we developed the first machine learning platform, HelPredictor, that integrates three feature selection methods, namely, principal components analysis, F-score algorithm and squared coefficient of variation, and four classical machine learning classifiers that different combinations of methods and classifiers have independent outputs by increment feature selection method. With application to single-cell sequencing data of human embryo, HelPredictor not only achieved 94.9% and 90.9% respectively with cross-validation and independent test, but also fast classified different embryonic lineages and their development trajectories using less HelPredictor-predicted factors. The above-mentioned candidate lineage-specific genes were discussed in detail and were clustered for exploring transitions of embryonic heterogeneity. Our tool can fast and efficiently reveal potential lineage-specific and stage-specific biomarkers and provide insights into how advanced computational tools contribute to development research. The source code is available at https://github.com/liameihao/HelPredictor.
39276328	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	scHyper: reconstructing cell-cell communication through hypergraph neural networks.	Cell-cell communications is crucial for the regulation of cellular life and the establishment of cellular relationships. Most approaches of inferring intercellular communications from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data lack a comprehensive global network view of multilayered communications. In this context, we propose scHyper, a new method that can infer intercellular communications from a global network perspective and identify the potential impact of all cells, ligand, and receptor expression on the communication score. scHyper designed a new way to represent tripartite relationships, by extracting a heterogeneous hypergraph that includes the source (ligand expression), the target (receptor expression), and the relevant ligand-receptor (L-R) pairs. scHyper is based on hypergraph representation learning, which measures the degree of match between the intrinsic attributes (static embeddings) of nodes and their observed behaviors (dynamic embeddings) in the context (hyperedges), quantifies the probability of forming hyperedges, and thus reconstructs the cell-cell communication score. Additionally, to effectively mine the key mechanisms of signal transmission, we collect a rich dataset of multisubunit complex L-R pairs and propose a nonparametric test to determine significant intercellular communications. Comparing with other tools indicates that scHyper exhibits superior performance and functionality. Experimental results on the human tumor microenvironment and immune cells demonstrate that scHyper offers reliable and unique capabilities for analyzing intercellular communication networks. Therefore, we introduced an effective strategy that can build high-order interaction patterns, surpassing the limitations of most methods that can only handle low-order interactions, thus more accurately interpreting the complexity of intercellular communications.

32379315	2020	Nucleic acids research	BREM-SC: a bayesian random effects mixture model for joint clustering single cell multi-omics data.	Droplet-based single cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology, largely represented by the 10x Genomics Chromium system, is able to measure the gene expression from tens of thousands of single cells simultaneously. More recently, coupled with the cutting-edge Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing (CITE-seq), the droplet-based system has allowed for immunophenotyping of single cells based on cell surface expression of specific proteins together with simultaneous transcriptome profiling in the same cell. Despite the rapid advances in technologies, novel statistical methods and computational tools for analyzing multi-modal CITE-Seq data are lacking. In this study, we developed BREM-SC, a novel Bayesian Random Effects Mixture model that jointly clusters paired single cell transcriptomic and proteomic data. Through simulation studies and analysis of public and in-house real data sets, we successfully demonstrated the validity and advantages of this method in fully utilizing both types of data to accurately identify cell clusters. In addition, as a probabilistic model-based approach, BREM-SC is able to quantify the clustering uncertainty for each single cell. This new method will greatly facilitate researchers to jointly study transcriptome and surface proteins at the single cell level to make new biological discoveries, particularly in the area of immunology.
33285568	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	FEATS: feature selection-based clustering of single-cell RNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: Advances in next-generation sequencing have made it possible to carry out transcriptomic studies at single-cell resolution and generate vast amounts of single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data rapidly. Thus, tools to analyze this data need to evolve as well as to improve accuracy and efficiency. RESULTS: We present FEATS, a Python software package, that performs clustering on single-cell RNA-seq data. FEATS is capable of performing multiple tasks such as estimating the number of clusters, conducting outlier detection and integrating data from various experiments. We develop a univariate feature selection-based approach for clustering, which involves the selection of top informative features to improve clustering performance. This is motivated by the fact that cell types are often manually determined using the expression of only a few known marker genes. On a variety of single-cell RNA-seq datasets, FEATS gives superior performance compared with the current tools, in terms of adjusted Rand index and estimating the number of clusters. It achieves a 22% improvement in clustering and more accurately estimates the number of clusters when compared with other tools. In addition to cluster estimation, FEATS also performs outlier detection and data integration while giving an excellent computational performance. Thus, FEATS is a comprehensive clustering tool capable of addressing the challenges during the clustering of single-cell RNA-seq data. AVAILABILITY: The installation instructions and documentation of FEATS is available at https://edwinv87.github.io/feats/. SUPPLEMENTARY DATA: Supplementary data are available online at https://academic.oup.com/bib.
38555477	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	PANoptosis, an indicator of COVID-19 severity and outcomes.	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been wreaking havoc for 3 years. PANoptosis, a distinct and physiologically relevant inflammatory programmed cell death, perpetuates cytokine storm and multi-organ injuries in COVID-19. Although PANoptosis performs indispensable roles in host defense, further investigation is needed to elucidate the exact processes through which PANoptosis modulates immunological responses and prognosis in COVID-19. This study conducted a bioinformatics analysis of online single-cell RNA sequence (scRNA-seq) and bulk RNA-seq datasets to explore the potential of PANoptosis as an indicator of COVID-19 severity. The degree of PANoptosis in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) indicated the severity of COVID-19. Single-cell transcriptomics identified pro-inflammatory monocytes as one of the primary sites of PANoptosis in COVID-19. The study subsequently demonstrated the immune and metabolic characteristics of this group of pro-inflammatory monocytes. In addition, the analysis illustrated that dexamethasone was likely to alleviate inflammation in COVID-19 by mitigating PANoptosis. Finally, the study showed that the PANoptosis-related genes could predict the intensive care unit admission (ICU) and outcomes of COVID-19 patients who are hospitalized.
36063455	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	SD2: spatially resolved transcriptomics deconvolution through integration of dropout and spatial information.	MOTIVATION: Unveiling the heterogeneity in the tissues is crucial to explore cell-cell interactions and cellular targets of human diseases. Spatial transcriptomics (ST) supplies spatial gene expression profile which has revolutionized our biological understanding, but variations in cell-type proportions of each spot with dozens of cells would confound downstream analysis. Therefore, deconvolution of ST has been an indispensable step and a technical challenge toward the higher-resolution panorama of tissues. RESULTS: Here, we propose a novel ST deconvolution method called SD2 integrating spatial information of ST data and embracing an important characteristic, dropout, which is traditionally considered as an obstruction in single-cell RNA sequencing data (scRNA-seq) analysis. First, we extract the dropout-based genes as informative features from ST and scRNA-seq data by fitting a Michaelis-Menten function. After synthesizing pseudo-ST spots by randomly composing cells from scRNA-seq data, auto-encoder is applied to discover low-dimensional and non-linear representation of the real- and pseudo-ST spots. Next, we create a graph containing embedded profiles as nodes, and edges determined by transcriptional similarity and spatial relationship. Given the graph, a graph convolutional neural network is used to predict the cell-type compositions for real-ST spots. We benchmark the performance of SD2 on the simulated seqFISH+ dataset with different resolutions and measurements which show superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods. SD2 is further validated on three real-world datasets with different ST technologies and demonstrates the capability to localize cell-type composition accurately with quantitative evidence. Finally, ablation study is conducted to verify the contribution of different modules proposed in SD2. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The SD2 is freely available in github (https://github.com/leihouyeung/SD2) and Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7024684).

38867706	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Ragas: integration and enhanced visualization for single cell subcluster analysis.	SUMMARY: Subcluster analysis is a powerful means to improve clustering and characterization of single cell RNA-Seq data. However, there are no existing tools to systematically integrate results from multiple subclusters, which creates hurdles for accurate data quantification, visualization, and interpretation in downstream analysis. To address this issue, we developed Ragas, an R package that integrates multi-level subclustering objects for streamlined analysis and visualization. A new data structure was implemented to seamlessly connect and assemble miscellaneous single cell analyses from different levels of subclustering, along with several new or enhanced visualization functions. Moreover, a re-projection algorithm was developed to integrate nearest-neighbor graphs from multiple subclusters in order to maximize their separability on the combined cell embeddings, which significantly improved the presentation of rare and homogeneous subpopulations. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The Ragas package and its documentation can be accessed through https://github.com/jig4003/Ragas and its source code is also available at https://zenodo.org/records/11244921.
30890159	2019	Genome biology	PAGA: graph abstraction reconciles clustering with trajectory inference through a topology preserving map of single cells.	Single-cell RNA-seq quantifies biological heterogeneity across both discrete cell types and continuous cell transitions. Partition-based graph abstraction (PAGA) provides an interpretable graph-like map of the arising data manifold, based on estimating connectivity of manifold partitions ( https://github.com/theislab/paga ). PAGA maps preserve the global topology of data, allow analyzing data at different resolutions, and result in much higher computational efficiency of the typical exploratory data analysis workflow. We demonstrate the method by inferring structure-rich cell maps with consistent topology across four hematopoietic datasets, adult planaria and the zebrafish embryo and benchmark computational performance on one million neurons.
33279962	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	Coupled co-clustering-based unsupervised transfer learning for the integrative analysis of single-cell genomic data.	Unsupervised methods, such as clustering methods, are essential to the analysis of single-cell genomic data. The most current clustering methods are designed for one data type only, such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) or sc-methylation data alone, and a few are developed for the integrative analysis of multiple data types. The integrative analysis of multimodal single-cell genomic data sets leverages the power in multiple data sets and can deepen the biological insight. In this paper, we propose a coupled co-clustering-based unsupervised transfer learning algorithm (coupleCoC) for the integrative analysis of multimodal single-cell data. Our proposed coupleCoC builds upon the information theoretic co-clustering framework. In co-clustering, both the cells and the genomic features are simultaneously clustered. Clustering similar genomic features reduces the noise in single-cell data and facilitates transfer of knowledge across single-cell datasets. We applied coupleCoC for the integrative analysis of scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq data, sc-methylation and scRNA-seq data and scRNA-seq data from mouse and human. We demonstrate that coupleCoC improves the overall clustering performance and matches the cell subpopulations across multimodal single-cell genomic datasets. Our method coupleCoC is also computationally efficient and can scale up to large datasets. Availability: The software and datasets are available at https://github.com/cuhklinlab/coupleCoC.
30951147	2019	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scRNAss: a single-cell RNA-seq assembler via imputing dropouts and combing junctions.	MOTIVATION: Full-length transcript reconstruction is essential for single-cell RNA-seq data analysis, but dropout events, which can cause transcripts discarded completely or broken into pieces, pose great challenges for transcript assembly. Currently available RNA-seq assemblers are generally designed for bulk RNA sequencing. To fill the gap, we introduce single-cell RNA-seq assembler, a method that applies explicit strategies to impute lost information caused by dropout events and a combing strategy to infer transcripts using scRNA-seq. RESULTS: Extensive evaluations on both simulated and biological datasets demonstrated its superiority over the state-of-the-art RNA-seq assemblers including StringTie, Cufflinks and CLASS2. In particular, it showed a remarkable capability of recovering unknown 'novel' isoforms and highly computational efficiency compared to other tools. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: scRNAss is free, open-source software available from https://sourceforge.net/projects/single-cell-rna-seq-assembly/files/. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
34864884	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	CellVGAE: an unsupervised scRNA-seq analysis workflow with graph attention networks.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing allows high-resolution views of individual cells for libraries of up to millions of samples, thus motivating the use of deep learning for analysis. In this study, we introduce the use of graph neural networks for the unsupervised exploration of scRNA-seq data by developing a variational graph autoencoder architecture with graph attention layers that operates directly on the connectivity between cells, focusing on dimensionality reduction and clustering. With the help of several case studies, we show that our model, named CellVGAE, can be effectively used for exploratory analysis even on challenging datasets, by extracting meaningful features from the data and providing the means to visualize and interpret different aspects of the model. RESULTS: We show that CellVGAE is more interpretable than existing scRNA-seq variational architectures by analysing the graph attention coefficients. By drawing parallels with other scRNA-seq studies on interpretability, we assess the validity of the relationships modelled by attention, and furthermore, we show that CellVGAE can intrinsically capture information such as pseudotime and NF-kB activation dynamics, the latter being a property that is not generally shared by existing neural alternatives. We then evaluate the dimensionality reduction and clustering performance on 9 difficult and well-annotated datasets by comparing with three leading neural and non-neural techniques, concluding that CellVGAE outperforms competing methods. Finally, we report a decrease in training times of up to x 20 on a dataset of 1.3 million cells compared to existing deep learning architectures. AVAILABILITYAND IMPLEMENTATION: The CellVGAE code is available at https://github.com/davidbuterez/CellVGAE. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
39694856	2025	Genome research	Diffusion-based generation of gene regulatory networks from scRNA-seq data with DigNet.	A gene regulatory network (GRN) intricately encodes the interconnectedness of identities and functionalities of genes within cells, ultimately shaping cellular specificity. Despite decades of endeavors, reverse engineering of GRNs from gene expression profiling data remains a profound challenge, particularly when it comes to reconstructing cell-specific GRNs that are tailored to precise cellular and genetic contexts. Here, we propose a discrete diffusion generation model, called DigNet, capable of generating corresponding GRNs from high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. DigNet embeds the network generation process into a multistep recovery procedure with Markov properties. Each intermediate step has a specific model to recover a portion of the gene regulatory architectures. It thus can ensure compatibility between global network structures and regulatory modules through the unique multistep diffusion procedure. Furthermore, through iMetacell integration and non-Euclidean discrete space modeling, DigNet is robust to the presence of noise in scRNA-seq data and the sparsity of GRNs. Benchmark evaluation results against more than a dozen state-of-the-art network inference methods demonstrate that DigNet achieves superior performance across various single-cell GRN reconstruction experiments. Furthermore, DigNet provides unique insights into the immune response in breast cancer, derived from differential gene regulation identified in T cells. As an open-source software, DigNet offers a powerful and effective tool for generating cell-specific GRNs from scRNA-seq data.
38603616	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scDAC: deep adaptive clustering of single-cell transcriptomic data with coupled autoencoder and Dirichlet process mixture model.	MOTIVATION: Clustering analysis for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data is an important step in revealing cellular heterogeneity. Many clustering methods have been proposed to discover heterogenous cell types from scRNA-seq data. However, adaptive clustering with accurate cluster number reflecting intrinsic biology nature from large-scale scRNA-seq data remains quite challenging. RESULTS: Here, we propose a single-cell Deep Adaptive Clustering (scDAC) model by coupling the Autoencoder (AE) and the Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (DPMM). By jointly optimizing the model parameters of AE and DPMM, scDAC achieves adaptive clustering with accurate cluster numbers on scRNA-seq data. We verify the performance of scDAC on five subsampled datasets with different numbers of cell types and compare it with 15 widely used clustering methods across nine scRNA-seq datasets. Our results demonstrate that scDAC can adaptively find accurate numbers of cell types or subtypes and outperforms other methods. Moreover, the performance of scDAC is robust to hyperparameter changes. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The scDAC is implemented in Python. The source code is available at https://github.com/labomics/scDAC.
34125905	2021	Nucleic acids research	Cell type hierarchy reconstruction via reconciliation of multi-resolution cluster tree.	A wealth of clustering algorithms are available for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to enable the identification of functionally distinct subpopulations that each possess a different pattern of gene expression activity. Implementation of these methods requires a choice of resolution parameter to determine the number of clusters, and critical judgment from the researchers is required to determine the desired resolution. This supervised process takes significant time and effort. Moreover, it can be difficult to compare and characterize the evolution of cell clusters from results obtained at one single resolution. To overcome these challenges, we built Multi-resolution Reconciled Tree (MRtree), a highly flexible tree-construction algorithm that generates a cluster hierarchy from flat clustering results attained for a range of resolutions. Because MRtree can be coupled with most scRNA-seq clustering algorithms, it inherits the robustness and versatility of a flat clustering approach, while maintaining the hierarchical structure of cells. The constructed trees from multiple scRNA-seq datasets effectively reflect the extent of transcriptional distinctions among cell groups and align well with levels of functional specializations among cells. Importantly, application to fetal brain cells identified subtypes of cells determined mainly by maturation states, spatial location and terminal specification.
39927857	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	B-Lightning: using bait genes for marker gene hunting in single-cell data with complex heterogeneity.	In single-cell studies, cells can be characterized with multiple sources of heterogeneity (SOH) such as cell type, developmental stage, cell cycle phase, activation state, and so on. In some studies, many nuisance SOH are of no interest, but may confound the identification of the SOH of interest, and thus affect the accurate annotate the corresponding cell subpopulations. In this paper, we develop B-Lightning, a novel and robust method designed to identify marker genes and cell subpopulations corresponding to an SOH (e.g. cell activation status), isolating it from other SOH (e.g. cell type, cell cycle phase). B-Lightning uses an iterative approach to enrich a small set of trustworthy marker genes to more reliable marker genes and boost the signals of the SOH of interest. Multiple numerical and experimental studies showed that B-Lightning outperforms existing methods in terms of sensitivity and robustness in identifying marker genes. Moreover, it increases the power to differentiate cell subpopulations of interest from other heterogeneous cohorts. B-Lightning successfully identified new senescence markers in ciliated cells from human idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis lung tissues, new T-cell memory and effector markers in the context of SARS-COV-2 infections, and their synchronized patterns that were previously neglected, new AD markers that can better differentiate AD severity, and new dendritic cell functioning markers with differential transcriptomics profiles across breast cancer subtypes. This paper highlights B-Lightning's potential as a powerful tool for single-cell data analysis, particularly in complex data sets where SOH of interest are entangled with numerous nuisance factors.
29073931	2017	Genome biology	scDual-Seq: mapping the gene regulatory program of Salmonella infection by host and pathogen single-cell RNA-sequencing.	The interaction between a pathogen and a host is a highly dynamic process in which both agents activate complex programs. Here, we introduce a single-cell RNA-sequencing method, scDual-Seq, that simultaneously captures both host and pathogen transcriptomes. We use it to study the process of infection of individual mouse macrophages with the intracellular pathogen Salmonella typhimurium. Among the infected macrophages, we find three subpopulations and we show evidence for a linear progression through these subpopulations, supporting a model in which these three states correspond to consecutive stages of infection.
27824854	2016	Nature biotechnology	Revealing the vectors of cellular identity with single-cell genomics.	Single-cell genomics has now made it possible to create a comprehensive atlas of human cells. At the same time, it has reopened definitions of a cell's identity and of the ways in which identity is regulated by the cell's molecular circuitry. Emerging computational analysis methods, especially in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), have already begun to reveal, in a data-driven way, the diverse simultaneous facets of a cell's identity, from discrete cell types to continuous dynamic transitions and spatial locations. These developments will eventually allow a cell to be represented as a superposition of 'basis vectors', each determining a different (but possibly dependent) aspect of cellular organization and function. However, computational methods must also overcome considerable challenges-from handling technical noise and data scale to forming new abstractions of biology. As the scale of single-cell experiments continues to increase, new computational approaches will be essential for constructing and characterizing a reference map of cell identities.
40107722	2025	Genome research	De novo detection of somatic variants in high-quality long-read single-cell RNA sequencing data.	In cancer, genetic and transcriptomic variations generate clonal heterogeneity, leading to treatment resistance. Long-read single-cell RNA sequencing (LR scRNA-seq) has the potential to detect genetic and transcriptomic variations simultaneously. Here, we present LongSom, a computational workflow leveraging high-quality LR scRNA-seq data to call de novo somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), including in mitochondria (mtSNVs), copy number alterations (CNAs), and gene fusions, to reconstruct the tumor clonal heterogeneity. Before somatic variant calling, LongSom reannotates marker gene-based cell types using cell mutational profiles. LongSom distinguishes somatic SNVs from noise and germline polymorphisms by applying an extensive set of hard filters and statistical tests. Applying LongSom to human ovarian cancer samples, we detected clinically relevant somatic SNVs that were validated against matched DNA samples. Leveraging somatic SNVs and fusions, LongSom found subclones with different predicted treatment outcomes. In summary, LongSom enables de novo variant detection without the need for normal samples, facilitating the study of cancer evolution, clonal heterogeneity, and treatment resistance.
40611203	2025	Genome biology	Ensemblex: an accuracy-weighted ensemble genetic demultiplexing framework for population-scale scRNAseq sample pooling.	Multiplexing samples from distinct individuals prior to sequencing is a promising step towards achieving population-scale single-cell RNA sequencing by reducing the restrictive costs of the technology. Individual genetic demultiplexing tools resolve the donor-of-origin identity of pooled cells using natural genetic variation but present diminished accuracy on highly multiplexed experiments, impeding the analytic potential of the dataset. In response, we introduce Ensemblex: an accuracy-weighted, ensemble genetic demultiplexing framework that integrates four distinct algorithms to identify the most probable subject labels. Using computationally and experimentally pooled samples, we demonstrate Ensemblex's superior accuracy and illustrate the implications of robust demultiplexing on biological analyses.
31992614	2020	Genome research	netNMF-sc: leveraging gene-gene interactions for imputation and dimensionality reduction in single-cell expression analysis.	Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables high-throughput measurement of RNA expression in single cells. However, because of technical limitations, scRNA-seq data often contain zero counts for many transcripts in individual cells. These zero counts, or dropout events, complicate the analysis of scRNA-seq data using standard methods developed for bulk RNA-seq data. Current scRNA-seq analysis methods typically overcome dropout by combining information across cells in a lower-dimensional space, leveraging the observation that cells generally occupy a small number of RNA expression states. We introduce netNMF-sc, an algorithm for scRNA-seq analysis that leverages information across both cells and genes. netNMF-sc learns a low-dimensional representation of scRNA-seq transcript counts using network-regularized non-negative matrix factorization. The network regularization takes advantage of prior knowledge of gene-gene interactions, encouraging pairs of genes with known interactions to be nearby each other in the low-dimensional representation. The resulting matrix factorization imputes gene abundance for both zero and nonzero counts and can be used to cluster cells into meaningful subpopulations. We show that netNMF-sc outperforms existing methods at clustering cells and estimating gene-gene covariance using both simulated and real scRNA-seq data, with increasing advantages at higher dropout rates (e.g., >60%). We also show that the results from netNMF-sc are robust to variation in the input network, with more representative networks leading to greater performance gains.
32513247	2020	Genome biology	CB2 improves power of cell detection in droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing data.	An important challenge in pre-processing data from droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing protocols is distinguishing barcodes associated with real cells from those binding background reads. Existing methods test barcodes individually and consequently do not leverage the strong cell-to-cell correlation present in most datasets. To improve cell detection, we introduce CB2, a cluster-based approach for distinguishing real cells from background barcodes. As demonstrated in simulated and case study datasets, CB2 has increased power for identifying real cells which allows for the identification of novel subpopulations and improves the precision of downstream analyses.

38628114	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	stDiff: a diffusion model for imputing spatial transcriptomics through single-cell transcriptomics.	Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has become a powerful tool for exploring the spatial organization of gene expression in tissues. Imaging-based methods, though offering superior spatial resolutions at the single-cell level, are limited in either the number of imaged genes or the sensitivity of gene detection. Existing approaches for enhancing ST rely on the similarity between ST cells and reference single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) cells. In contrast, we introduce stDiff, which leverages relationships between gene expression abundance in scRNA-seq data to enhance ST. stDiff employs a conditional diffusion model, capturing gene expression abundance relationships in scRNA-seq data through two Markov processes: one introducing noise to transcriptomics data and the other denoising to recover them. The missing portion of ST is predicted by incorporating the original ST data into the denoising process. In our comprehensive performance evaluation across 16 datasets, utilizing multiple clustering and similarity metrics, stDiff stands out for its exceptional ability to preserve topological structures among cells, positioning itself as a robust solution for cell population identification. Moreover, stDiff's enhancement outcomes closely mirror the actual ST data within the batch space. Across diverse spatial expression patterns, our model accurately reconstructs them, delineating distinct spatial boundaries. This highlights stDiff's capability to unify the observed and predicted segments of ST data for subsequent analysis. We anticipate that stDiff, with its innovative approach, will contribute to advancing ST imputation methodologies.
36631401	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	scDCCA: deep contrastive clustering for single-cell RNA-seq data based on auto-encoder network.	The advances in single-cell ribonucleic acid sequencing (scRNA-seq) allow researchers to explore cellular heterogeneity and human diseases at cell resolution. Cell clustering is a prerequisite in scRNA-seq analysis since it can recognize cell identities. However, the high dimensionality, noises and significant sparsity of scRNA-seq data have made it a big challenge. Although many methods have emerged, they still fail to fully explore the intrinsic properties of cells and the relationship among cells, which seriously affects the downstream clustering performance. Here, we propose a new deep contrastive clustering algorithm called scDCCA. It integrates a denoising auto-encoder and a dual contrastive learning module into a deep clustering framework to extract valuable features and realize cell clustering. Specifically, to better characterize and learn data representations robustly, scDCCA utilizes a denoising Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial model-based auto-encoder to extract low-dimensional features. Meanwhile, scDCCA incorporates a dual contrastive learning module to capture the pairwise proximity of cells. By increasing the similarities between positive pairs and the differences between negative ones, the contrasts at both the instance and the cluster level help the model learn more discriminative features and achieve better cell segregation. Furthermore, scDCCA joins feature learning with clustering, which realizes representation learning and cell clustering in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results of 14 real datasets validate that scDCCA outperforms eight state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, generalizability, scalability and efficiency. Cell visualization and biological analysis demonstrate that scDCCA significantly improves clustering and facilitates downstream analysis for scRNA-seq data. The code is available at https://github.com/WJ319/scDCCA.
31226206	2019	Nucleic acids research	CHETAH: a selective, hierarchical cell type identification method for single-cell RNA sequencing.	Cell type identification is essential for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) studies, currently transforming the life sciences. CHETAH (CHaracterization of cEll Types Aided by Hierarchical classification) is an accurate cell type identification algorithm that is rapid and selective, including the possibility of intermediate or unassigned categories. Evidence for assignment is based on a classification tree of previously available scRNA-seq reference data and includes a confidence score based on the variance in gene expression per cell type. For cell types represented in the reference data, CHETAH's accuracy is as good as existing methods. Its specificity is superior when cells of an unknown type are encountered, such as malignant cells in tumor samples which it pinpoints as intermediate or unassigned. Although designed for tumor samples in particular, the use of unassigned and intermediate types is also valuable in other exploratory studies. This is exemplified in pancreas datasets where CHETAH highlights cell populations not well represented in the reference dataset, including cells with profiles that lie on a continuum between that of acinar and ductal cell types. Having the possibility of unassigned and intermediate cell types is pivotal for preventing misclassification and can yield important biological information for previously unexplored tissues.
38725155	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Data-driven selection of analysis decisions in single-cell RNA-seq trajectory inference.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiments have become instrumental in developmental and differentiation studies, enabling the profiling of cells at a single or multiple time-points to uncover subtle variations in expression profiles reflecting underlying biological processes. Benchmarking studies have compared many of the computational methods used to reconstruct cellular dynamics; however, researchers still encounter challenges in their analysis due to uncertainty with respect to selecting the most appropriate methods and parameters. Even among universal data processing steps used by trajectory inference methods such as feature selection and dimension reduction, trajectory methods' performances are highly dataset-specific. To address these challenges, we developed Escort, a novel framework for evaluating a dataset's suitability for trajectory inference and quantifying trajectory properties influenced by analysis decisions. Escort evaluates the suitability of trajectory analysis and the combined effects of processing choices using trajectory-specific metrics. Escort navigates single-cell trajectory analysis through these data-driven assessments, reducing uncertainty and much of the decision burden inherent to trajectory inference analyses. Escort is implemented in an accessible R package and R/Shiny application, providing researchers with the necessary tools to make informed decisions during trajectory analysis and enabling new insights into dynamic biological processes at single-cell resolution.
36575517	2022	Genome biology	Clustering Deviation Index (CDI): a robust and accurate internal measure for evaluating scRNA-seq data clustering.	Most single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses begin with cell clustering; thus, the clustering accuracy considerably impacts the validity of downstream analyses. In contrast with the abundance of clustering methods, the tools to assess the clustering accuracy are limited. We propose a new Clustering Deviation Index (CDI) that measures the deviation of any clustering label set from the observed single-cell data. We conduct in silico and experimental scRNA-seq studies to show that CDI can select the optimal clustering label set. As a result, CDI also informs the optimal tuning parameters for any given clustering method and the correct number of cluster components.
30886410	2019	Nature methods	Cell composition analysis of bulk genomics using single-cell data.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a rich resource of cellular heterogeneity, opening new avenues in the study of complex tissues. We introduce Cell Population Mapping (CPM), a deconvolution algorithm in which reference scRNA-seq profiles are leveraged to infer the composition of cell types and states from bulk transcriptome data ('scBio' CRAN R-package). Analysis of individual variations in lungs of influenza-virus-infected mice reveals that the relationship between cell abundance and clinical symptoms is a cell-state-specific property that varies gradually along the continuum of cell-activation states. The gradual change is confirmed in subsequent experiments and is further explained by a mathematical model in which clinical outcomes relate to cell-state dynamics along the activation process. Our results demonstrate the power of CPM in reconstructing the continuous spectrum of cell states within heterogeneous tissues.
38976751	2024	PLoS computational biology	scBoolSeq: Linking scRNA-seq statistics and Boolean dynamics.	Boolean networks are largely employed to model the qualitative dynamics of cell fate processes by describing the change of binary activation states of genes and transcription factors with time. Being able to bridge such qualitative states with quantitative measurements of gene expression in cells, as scRNA-seq, is a cornerstone for data-driven model construction and validation. On one hand, scRNA-seq binarisation is a key step for inferring and validating Boolean models. On the other hand, the generation of synthetic scRNA-seq data from baseline Boolean models provides an important asset to benchmark inference methods. However, linking characteristics of scRNA-seq datasets, including dropout events, with Boolean states is a challenging task. We present scBoolSeq, a method for the bidirectional linking of scRNA-seq data and Boolean activation state of genes. Given a reference scRNA-seq dataset, scBoolSeq computes statistical criteria to classify the empirical gene pseudocount distributions as either unimodal, bimodal, or zero-inflated, and fit a probabilistic model of dropouts, with gene-dependent parameters. From these learnt distributions, scBoolSeq can perform both binarisation of scRNA-seq datasets, and generate synthetic scRNA-seq datasets from Boolean traces, as issued from Boolean networks, using biased sampling and dropout simulation. We present a case study demonstrating the application of scBoolSeq's binarisation scheme in data-driven model inference. Furthermore, we compare synthetic scRNA-seq data generated by scBoolSeq with BoolODE's, data for the same Boolean Network model. The comparison shows that our method better reproduces the statistics of real scRNA-seq datasets, such as the mean-variance and mean-dropout relationships while exhibiting clearly defined trajectories in two-dimensional projections of the data.
37188501	2023	Nucleic acids research	A single-cell map of antisense oligonucleotide activity in the brain.	Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) dosed into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) distribute broadly throughout the central nervous system (CNS). By modulating RNA, they hold the promise of targeting root molecular causes of disease and hold potential to treat myriad CNS disorders. Realization of this potential requires that ASOs must be active in the disease-relevant cells, and ideally, that monitorable biomarkers also reflect ASO activity in these cells. The biodistribution and activity of such centrally delivered ASOs have been deeply characterized in rodent and non-human primate (NHP) models, but usually only in bulk tissue, limiting our understanding of the distribution of ASO activity across individual cells and across diverse CNS cell types. Moreover, in human clinical trials, target engagement is usually monitorable only in a single compartment, CSF. We sought a deeper understanding of how individual cells and cell types contribute to bulk tissue signal in the CNS, and how these are linked to CSF biomarker outcomes. We employed single nucleus transcriptomics on tissue from mice treated with RNase H1 ASOs against Prnp and Malat1 and NHPs treated with an ASO against PRNP. Pharmacologic activity was observed in every cell type, though sometimes with substantial differences in magnitude. Single cell RNA count distributions implied target RNA suppression in every single sequenced cell, rather than intense knockdown in only some cells. Duration of action up to 12 weeks post-dose differed across cell types, being shorter in microglia than in neurons. Suppression in neurons was generally similar to, or more robust than, the bulk tissue. In macaques, PrP in CSF was lowered 40% in conjunction with PRNP knockdown across all cell types including neurons, arguing that a CSF biomarker readout is likely to reflect ASO pharmacodynamic effect in disease-relevant cells in a neuronal disorder. Our results provide a reference dataset for ASO activity distribution in the CNS and establish single nucleus sequencing as a method for evaluating cell type specificity of oligonucleotide therapeutics and other modalities.
31471617	2019	Nature methods	Data denoising with transfer learning in single-cell transcriptomics.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data are noisy and sparse. Here, we show that transfer learning across datasets remarkably improves data quality. By coupling a deep autoencoder with a Bayesian model, SAVER-X extracts transferable gene-gene relationships across data from different labs, varying conditions and divergent species, to denoise new target datasets.
36305818	2023	Nucleic acids research	SPEED: Single-cell Pan-species atlas in the light of Ecology and Evolution for Development and Diseases.	It is a challenge to efficiently integrate and present the tremendous amounts of single-cell data generated from multiple tissues of various species. Here, we create a new database named SPEED for single-cell pan-species atlas in the light of ecology and evolution for development and diseases (freely accessible at http://8.142.154.29 or http://speedatlas.net). SPEED is an online platform with 4 data modules, 7 function modules and 2 display modules. The 'Pan' module is applied for the interactive analysis of single cell sequencing datasets from 127 species, and the 'Evo', 'Devo', and 'Diz' modules provide comprehensive analysis of single-cell atlases on 18 evolution datasets, 28 development datasets, and 85 disease datasets. The 'C2C', 'G2G' and 'S2S' modules explore intercellular communications, genetic regulatory networks, and cross-species molecular evolution. The 'sSearch', 'sMarker', 'sUp', and 'sDown' modules allow users to retrieve specific data information, obtain common marker genes for cell types, freely upload, and download single-cell datasets, respectively. Two display modules ('HOME' and 'HELP') offer easier access to the SPEED database with informative statistics and detailed guidelines. All in all, SPEED is an integrated platform for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell whole-genome sequencing (scWGS) datasets to assist the deep-mining and understanding of heterogeneity among cells, tissues, and species at multi-levels, angles, and orientations, as well as provide new insights into molecular mechanisms of biological development and pathogenesis.
40794943	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	DiffusionST: a deep generative diffusion model-based framework for enhancing spatial transcriptomics data quality and identifying spatial domains.	Recent advancements in spatial transcriptomics (ST) technology have generated substantial volumes of spatial transcriptome data. However, the quality of this data is often compromised due to the limitations of current sequencing technologies. To address this issue, DiffusionST proposes a method for imputing ST data and clustering the imputed data. The method employs a graph convolutional network model combined with a newly designed loss function, denoising data using the zero-inflated negative binomial distribution, and data enhancement through a diffusion model to improve clustering accuracy. DiffusionST demonstrates superior clustering accuracy compared to eight of the most popular ST clustering algorithms. DiffusionST also excels in data imputation when compared to five single-cell RNA sequencing imputation algorithms. Additionally, DiffusionST's robustness against noise is quantitatively validated by manually introducing random dropout noise into the dataset, where our model significantly enhances the quality of ST data. Moreover, DiffusionST is well-suited for high-resolution ST data and has been demonstrated, through survival analysis and cell-cell communication studies, to dissect spatial domains within breast cancer tissues. These findings provide strong evidence of DiffusionST's efficacy in handling ST data especially with strong noise, making it a valuable tool in this field.
31061482	2019	Nature biotechnology	Efficient integration of heterogeneous single-cell transcriptomes using Scanorama.	Integration of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from multiple experiments, laboratories and technologies can uncover biological insights, but current methods for scRNA-seq data integration are limited by a requirement for datasets to derive from functionally similar cells. We present Scanorama, an algorithm that identifies and merges the shared cell types among all pairs of datasets and accurately integrates heterogeneous collections of scRNA-seq data. We applied Scanorama to integrate and remove batch effects across 105,476 cells from 26 diverse scRNA-seq experiments representing 9 different technologies. Scanorama is sensitive to subtle temporal changes within the same cell lineage, successfully integrating functionally similar cells across time series data of CD14(+) monocytes at different stages of differentiation into macrophages. Finally, we show that Scanorama is orders of magnitude faster than existing techniques and can integrate a collection of 1,095,538 cells in just ~9 h.
40983951	2025	Genome biology	KEGNI: knowledge graph enhanced framework for gene regulatory network inference.	Inference of cell type-specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is a fundamental step in investigating complex regulatory mechanisms. Here, we present KEGNI (Knowledge graph-Enhanced Gene regulatory Network Inference), a knowledge-guided framework that employs a graph autoencoder to capture gene regulatory relationships and incorporates a knowledge graph to infer GRNs based on scRNA-seq data. KEGNI shows superior performance compared to multiple methods using scRNA-seq data or paired scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data. KEGNI can identify driver genes and elucidate the regulatory mechanisms underlying distinct cellular contexts. The modular design of KEGNI supports the integration of various knowledge graphs for context-specific tasks.
39487083	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Graph contrastive learning as a versatile foundation for advanced scRNA-seq data analysis.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers unprecedented insights into transcriptome-wide gene expression at the single-cell level. Cell clustering has been long established in the analysis of scRNA-seq data to identify the groups of cells with similar expression profiles. However, cell clustering is technically challenging, as raw scRNA-seq data have various analytical issues, including high dimensionality and dropout values. Existing research has developed deep learning models, such as graph machine learning models and contrastive learning-based models, for cell clustering using scRNA-seq data and has summarized the unsupervised learning of cell clustering into a human-interpretable format. While advances in cell clustering have been profound, we are no closer to finding a simple yet effective framework for learning high-quality representations necessary for robust clustering. In this study, we propose scSimGCL, a novel framework based on the graph contrastive learning paradigm for self-supervised pretraining of graph neural networks. This framework facilitates the generation of high-quality representations crucial for cell clustering. Our scSimGCL incorporates cell-cell graph structure and contrastive learning to enhance the performance of cell clustering. Extensive experimental results on simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets suggest the superiority of the proposed scSimGCL. Moreover, clustering assignment analysis confirms the general applicability of scSimGCL, including state-of-the-art clustering algorithms. Further, ablation study and hyperparameter analysis suggest the efficacy of our network architecture with the robustness of decisions in the self-supervised learning setting. The proposed scSimGCL can serve as a robust framework for practitioners developing tools for cell clustering. The source code of scSimGCL is publicly available at https://github.com/zhangzh1328/scSimGCL.
26201400	2015	Genome biology	Single-cell RNA-seq transcriptome analysis of linear and circular RNAs in mouse preimplantation embryos.	Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a new class of non-polyadenylated non-coding RNAs that may play important roles in many biological processes. Here we develop a single-cell universal poly(A)-independent RNA sequencing (SUPeR-seq) method to sequence both polyadenylated and non-polyadenylated RNAs from individual cells. This method exhibits robust sensitivity, precision and accuracy. We discover 2891 circRNAs and 913 novel linear transcripts in mouse preimplantation embryos and further analyze the abundance of circRNAs along development, the function of enriched genes, and sequence features of circRNAs. Our work is key to deciphering regulation mechanisms of circRNAs during mammalian early embryonic development.
39466790	2024	PLoS computational biology	Non-genetic differences underlie variability in proliferation among esophageal epithelial clones.	Individual cells grown in culture exhibit remarkable differences in their growth, with some cells capable of forming large clusters, while others are limited or fail to grow at all. While these differences have been observed across cell lines and human samples, the growth dynamics and associated cell states remain poorly understood. In this study, we performed clonal tracing through imaging and cellular barcoding of an in vitro model of esophageal epithelial cells (EPC2-hTERT). We found that about 10% of clones grow exponentially, while the remaining have cells that become non-proliferative leading to a halt in the growth rate. Using mathematical models, we demonstrate two distinct growth behaviors: exponential and logistic. Further, we discovered that the propensity to grow exponentially is largely heritable through four doublings and that the less proliferative clones can become highly proliferative through increasing plating density. Combining barcoding with single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), we identified the cellular states associated with the highly proliferative clones, which include genes in the WNT and PI3K pathways. Finally, we identified an enrichment of cells resembling the highly proliferative cell state in the proliferating healthy human esophageal epithelium.
38600666	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Improving drug response prediction via integrating gene relationships with deep learning.	Predicting the drug response of cancer cell lines is crucial for advancing personalized cancer treatment, yet remains challenging due to tumor heterogeneity and individual diversity. In this study, we present a deep learning-based framework named Deep neural network Integrating Prior Knowledge (DIPK) (DIPK), which adopts self-supervised techniques to integrate multiple valuable information, including gene interaction relationships, gene expression profiles and molecular topologies, to enhance prediction accuracy and robustness. We demonstrated the superior performance of DIPK compared to existing methods on both known and novel cells and drugs, underscoring the importance of gene interaction relationships in drug response prediction. In addition, DIPK extends its applicability to single-cell RNA sequencing data, showcasing its capability for single-cell-level response prediction and cell identification. Further, we assess the applicability of DIPK on clinical data. DIPK accurately predicted a higher response to paclitaxel in the pathological complete response (pCR) group compared to the residual disease group, affirming the better response of the pCR group to the chemotherapy compound. We believe that the integration of DIPK into clinical decision-making processes has the potential to enhance individualized treatment strategies for cancer patients.
33497379	2021	PLoS computational biology	mbkmeans: Fast clustering for single cell data using mini-batch k-means.	Single-cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-seq) is the most widely used high-throughput technology to measure genome-wide gene expression at the single-cell level. One of the most common analyses of scRNA-seq data detects distinct subpopulations of cells through the use of unsupervised clustering algorithms. However, recent advances in scRNA-seq technologies result in current datasets ranging from thousands to millions of cells. Popular clustering algorithms, such as k-means, typically require the data to be loaded entirely into memory and therefore can be slow or impossible to run with large datasets. To address this problem, we developed the mbkmeans R/Bioconductor package, an open-source implementation of the mini-batch k-means algorithm. Our package allows for on-disk data representations, such as the common HDF5 file format widely used for single-cell data, that do not require all the data to be loaded into memory at one time. We demonstrate the performance of the mbkmeans package using large datasets, including one with 1.3 million cells. We also highlight and compare the computing performance of mbkmeans against the standard implementation of k-means and other popular single-cell clustering methods. Our software package is available in Bioconductor at https://bioconductor.org/packages/mbkmeans.
39413055	2024	PLoS computational biology	Gene signatures for cancer research: A 25-year retrospective and future avenues.	Over the past two decades, extensive studies, particularly in cancer analysis through large datasets like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), have aimed at improving patient therapies and precision medicine. However, limited overlap and inconsistencies among gene signatures across different cohorts pose challenges. The dynamic nature of the transcriptome, encompassing diverse RNA species and functional complexities at gene and isoform levels, introduces intricacies, and current gene signatures face reproducibility issues due to the unique transcriptomic landscape of each patient. In this context, discrepancies arising from diverse sequencing technologies, data analysis algorithms, and software tools further hinder consistency. While careful experimental design, analytical strategies, and standardized protocols could enhance reproducibility, future prospects lie in multiomics data integration, machine learning techniques, open science practices, and collaborative efforts. Standardized metrics, quality control measures, and advancements in single-cell RNA-seq will contribute to unbiased gene signature identification. In this perspective article, we outline some thoughts and insights addressing challenges, standardized practices, and advanced methodologies enhancing the reliability of gene signatures in disease transcriptomic research.
41171129	2025	Nucleic acids research	SEA version 4.0: a major expansion and update of the Super-Enhancer Archive.	Super-enhancers (SEs) are pivotal epigenetic regulatory elements that profoundly influence cell fate and disease. We herein present an updated SEA version 4.0, a systematic platform designed to elucidate the roles of SEs. A uniform computational pipeline was established to identify SEs based on five key histone marks, using H3K27ac, BRD4, p300, Med1, and the newly added H3K4me1, across 14 species. 496 071 SEs and 29 584 078 enhancers have been stored in the database. It provides extensive genome annotations, including nearby genes, transcription factor binding sites, chromatin accessibility, and other gene regulation signatures. SEA version 4.0 has also achieved functional enrichment analysis of SEs. And a Shannon entropy-based algorithm is employed to identify specific SEs. Furthermore, SEA version 4.0 introduces an interactive regulatory network that incorporates SEs, enhancers, transcription factors, and proximal genes for human and mouse. Additionally, a cell-specific SE detector is provided, designed for cancer research by leveraging scRNA-seq data from 12 cancer and normal samples to explore cell-type-specific SEs. The performance interaction and visualization of SEA version 4.0 enable genomic and cross-species comparisons, revealing complex genomic interactions and becoming an indispensable resource for decoding the mechanisms of SE in development and disease.

35412632	2022	Nucleic acids research	TedSim: temporal dynamics simulation of single-cell RNA sequencing data and cell division history.	Recently, lineage tracing technology using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing has enabled simultaneous readouts of gene expressions and lineage barcodes, which allows for the reconstruction of the cell division tree and makes it possible to reconstruct ancestral cell types and trace the origin of each cell type. Meanwhile, trajectory inference methods are widely used to infer cell trajectories and pseudotime in a dynamic process using gene expression data of present-day cells. Here, we present TedSim (single-cell temporal dynamics simulator), which simulates the cell division events from the root cell to present-day cells, simultaneously generating two data modalities for each single cell: the lineage barcode and gene expression data. TedSim is a framework that connects the two problems: lineage tracing and trajectory inference. Using TedSim, we conducted analysis to show that (i) TedSim generates realistic gene expression and barcode data, as well as realistic relationships between these two data modalities; (ii) trajectory inference methods can recover the underlying cell state transition mechanism with balanced cell type compositions; and (iii) integrating gene expression and barcode data can provide more insights into the temporal dynamics in cell differentiation compared to using only one type of data, but better integration methods need to be developed.
39237300	2024	Genome research	A Bayesian framework for inferring dynamic intercellular interactions from time-series single-cell data.	Characterizing cell-cell communication and tracking its variability over time are crucial for understanding the coordination of biological processes mediating normal development, disease progression, and responses to perturbations such as therapies. Existing tools fail to capture time-dependent intercellular interactions and primarily rely on databases compiled from limited contexts. We introduce DIISCO, a Bayesian framework designed to characterize the temporal dynamics of cellular interactions using single-cell RNA-sequencing data from multiple time points. Our method utilizes structured Gaussian process regression to unveil time-resolved interactions among diverse cell types according to their coevolution and incorporates prior knowledge of receptor-ligand complexes. We show the interpretability of DIISCO in simulated data and new data collected from T cells cocultured with lymphoma cells, demonstrating its potential to uncover dynamic cell-cell cross talk.
32479601	2020	Nucleic acids research	CReSCENT: CanceR Single Cell ExpressioN Toolkit.	CReSCENT: CanceR Single Cell ExpressioN Toolkit (https://crescent.cloud), is an intuitive and scalable web portal incorporating a containerized pipeline execution engine for standardized analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. While scRNA-seq data for tumour specimens are readily generated, subsequent analysis requires high-performance computing infrastructure and user expertise to build analysis pipelines and tailor interpretation for cancer biology. CReSCENT uses public data sets and preconfigured pipelines that are accessible to computational biology non-experts and are user-editable to allow optimization, comparison, and reanalysis for specific experiments. Users can also upload their own scRNA-seq data for analysis and results can be kept private or shared with other users.
30531897	2018	Nature biotechnology	Dimensionality reduction for visualizing single-cell data using UMAP.	Advances in single-cell technologies have enabled high-resolution dissection of tissue composition. Several tools for dimensionality reduction are available to analyze the large number of parameters generated in single-cell studies. Recently, a nonlinear dimensionality-reduction technique, uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), was developed for the analysis of any type of high-dimensional data. Here we apply it to biological data, using three well-characterized mass cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. Comparing the performance of UMAP with five other tools, we find that UMAP provides the fastest run times, highest reproducibility and the most meaningful organization of cell clusters. The work highlights the use of UMAP for improved visualization and interpretation of single-cell data.
31412909	2019	Genome biology	scAlign: a tool for alignment, integration, and rare cell identification from scRNA-seq data.	scRNA-seq dataset integration occurs in different contexts, such as the identification of cell type-specific differences in gene expression across conditions or species, or batch effect correction. We present scAlign, an unsupervised deep learning method for data integration that can incorporate partial, overlapping, or a complete set of cell labels, and estimate per-cell differences in gene expression across datasets. scAlign performance is state-of-the-art and robust to cross-dataset variation in cell type-specific expression and cell type composition. We demonstrate that scAlign reveals gene expression programs for rare populations of malaria parasites. Our framework is widely applicable to integration challenges in other domains.
39988320	2025	Nucleic acids research	paraCell: a novel software tool for the interactive analysis and visualization of standard and dual host-parasite single-cell RNA-seq data.	Advances in sequencing technology have led to a dramatic increase in the number of single-cell transcriptomic datasets. In the field of parasitology, these datasets typically describe the gene expression patterns of a given parasite species at the single-cell level under experimental conditions, in specific hosts or tissues, or at different life cycle stages. However, while this wealth of available data represents a significant resource, analysing these datasets often requires expert computational skills, preventing a considerable proportion of the parasitology community from meaningfully integrating existing single-cell data into their work. Here, we present paraCell, a novel software tool that allows the user to visualize and analyse pre-loaded single-cell data without requiring any programming ability. The source code is free to allow remote installation. On our web server, we demonstrated how to visualize and re-analyse published Plasmodium and Trypanosoma datasets. We have also generated Toxoplasma-mouse and Theileria-cow scRNA-seq datasets to highlight the functionality of paraCell for pathogen-host interaction. The analysis of the data highlights the impact of the host interferon-gamma response and gene expression profiles associated with disease susceptibility by these intracellular parasites, respectively.
36536447	2022	Genome biology	Single-cell transcriptome reveals dominant subgenome expression and transcriptional response to heat stress in Chinese cabbage.	BACKGROUND: Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa ssp. pekinensis) experienced a whole-genome triplication event and thus has three subgenomes: least fractioned, medium fractioned, and most fractioned subgenome. Environmental changes affect leaf development, which in turn influence the yield. To improve the yield and resistance to different climate scenarios, a comprehensive understanding of leaf development is required including insights into the full diversity of cell types and transcriptional networks underlying their specificity. RESULTS: Here, we generate the transcriptional landscape of Chinese cabbage leaf at single-cell resolution by performing single-cell RNA sequencing of 30,000 individual cells. We characterize seven major cell types with 19 transcriptionally distinct cell clusters based on the expression of the reported marker genes. We find that genes in the least fractioned subgenome are predominantly expressed compared with those in the medium and most fractioned subgenomes in different cell types. Moreover, we generate a single-cell transcriptional map of leaves in response to high temperature. We find that heat stress not only affects gene expression in a cell type-specific manner but also impacts subgenome dominance. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the transcriptional networks in different cell types and provides a better understanding of transcriptional regulation during leaf development and transcriptional response to heat stress in Chinese cabbage.
37537351	2023	Nature methods	Dictys: dynamic gene regulatory network dissects developmental continuum with single-cell multiomics.	Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are key determinants of cell function and identity and are dynamically rewired during development and disease. Despite decades of advancement, challenges remain in GRN inference, including dynamic rewiring, causal inference, feedback loop modeling and context specificity. To address these challenges, we develop Dictys, a dynamic GRN inference and analysis method that leverages multiomic single-cell assays of chromatin accessibility and gene expression, context-specific transcription factor footprinting, stochastic process network and efficient probabilistic modeling of single-cell RNA-sequencing read counts. Dictys improves GRN reconstruction accuracy and reproducibility and enables the inference and comparative analysis of context-specific and dynamic GRNs across developmental contexts. Dictys' network analyses recover unique insights in human blood and mouse skin development with cell-type-specific and dynamic GRNs. Its dynamic network visualizations enable time-resolved discovery and investigation of developmental driver transcription factors and their regulated targets. Dictys is available as a free, open-source and user-friendly Python package.
35639499	2022	Nucleic acids research	Inference of cell state transitions and cell fate plasticity from single-cell with MARGARET.	Despite recent advances in inferring cellular dynamics using single-cell RNA-seq data, existing trajectory inference (TI) methods face difficulty in accurately reconstructing the cell-state manifold and cell-fate plasticity for complex topologies. Here, we present MARGARET (https://github.com/Zafar-Lab/Margaret) for inferring single-cell trajectory and fate mapping for diverse dynamic cellular processes. MARGARET reconstructs complex trajectory topologies using a deep unsupervised metric learning and a graph-partitioning approach based on a novel connectivity measure, automatically detects terminal cell states, and generalizes the quantification of fate plasticity for complex topologies. On a diverse benchmark consisting of synthetic and real datasets, MARGARET outperformed state-of-the-art methods in recovering global topology and cell pseudotime ordering. For human hematopoiesis, MARGARET accurately identified all major lineages and associated gene expression trends and helped identify transitional progenitors associated with key branching events. For embryoid body differentiation, MARGARET identified novel transitional populations that were validated by bulk sequencing and functionally characterized different precursor populations in the mesoderm lineage. For colon differentiation, MARGARET characterized the lineage for BEST4/OTOP2 cells and the heterogeneity in goblet cell lineage in the colon under normal and inflamed ulcerative colitis conditions. Finally, we demonstrated that MARGARET can scale to large scRNA-seq datasets consisting of  approximately  millions of cells.
28899397	2017	Genome biology	Splatter: simulation of single-cell RNA sequencing data.	As single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have rapidly developed, so have analysis methods. Many methods have been tested, developed, and validated using simulated datasets. Unfortunately, current simulations are often poorly documented, their similarity to real data is not demonstrated, or reproducible code is not available. Here, we present the Splatter Bioconductor package for simple, reproducible, and well-documented simulation of scRNA-seq data. Splatter provides an interface to multiple simulation methods including Splat, our own simulation, based on a gamma-Poisson distribution. Splat can simulate single populations of cells, populations with multiple cell types, or differentiation paths.
34911537	2021	Genome biology	splatPop: simulating population scale single-cell RNA sequencing data.	Population-scale single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is now viable, enabling finer resolution functional genomics studies and leading to a rush to adapt bulk methods and develop new single-cell-specific methods to perform these studies. Simulations are useful for developing, testing, and benchmarking methods but current scRNA-seq simulation frameworks do not simulate population-scale data with genetic effects. Here, we present splatPop, a model for flexible, reproducible, and well-documented simulation of population-scale scRNA-seq data with known expression quantitative trait loci. splatPop can also simulate complex batch, cell group, and conditional effects between individuals from different cohorts as well as genetically-driven co-expression.
32646524	2020	Genome biology	Genome-wide studies reveal the essential and opposite roles of ARID1A in controlling human cardiogenesis and neurogenesis from pluripotent stem cells.	BACKGROUND: Early human heart and brain development simultaneously occur during embryogenesis. Notably, in human newborns, congenital heart defects strongly associate with neurodevelopmental abnormalities, suggesting a common gene or complex underlying both cardiogenesis and neurogenesis. However, due to lack of in vivo studies, the molecular mechanisms that govern both early human heart and brain development remain elusive. RESULTS: Here, we report ARID1A, a DNA-binding subunit of the SWI/SNF epigenetic complex, controls both neurogenesis and cardiogenesis from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) through distinct mechanisms. Knockout-of-ARID1A (ARID1A(-/-)) leads to spontaneous differentiation of neural cells together with globally enhanced expression of neurogenic genes in undifferentiated hESCs. Additionally, when compared with WT hESCs, cardiac differentiation from ARID1A (-/-) hESCs is prominently suppressed, whereas neural differentiation is significantly promoted. Whole genome-wide scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and ChIP-seq analyses reveal that ARID1A is required to open chromatin accessibility on promoters of essential cardiogenic genes, and temporally associated with key cardiogenic transcriptional factors T and MEF2C during early cardiac development. However, during early neural development, transcription of most essential neurogenic genes is dependent on ARID1A, which can interact with a known neural restrictive silencer factor REST/NRSF. CONCLUSIONS: We uncover the opposite roles by ARID1A to govern both early cardiac and neural development from pluripotent stem cells. Global chromatin accessibility on cardiogenic genes is dependent on ARID1A, whereas transcriptional activity of neurogenic genes is under control by ARID1A, possibly through ARID1A-REST/NRSF interaction.
35552604	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Genomic sequences and RNA-binding proteins predict RNA splicing efficiency in various single-cell contexts.	MOTIVATION: The RNA splicing efficiency is of high interest for both understanding the regulatory machinery of gene expression and estimating the RNA velocity in single cells. However, its genomic regulation and stochasticity across contexts remain poorly understood. RESULTS: Here, by leveraging the recent RNA velocity tool, we estimated the relative splicing efficiency across a variety of single-cell RNA-Seq data sets. We further extracted large sets of genomic features and 120 RNA-binding protein features and found they are highly predictive to relative RNA splicing efficiency across multiple tissues and organs on human and mouse. This predictive power brings promise to reveal the complexity of RNA processing and to enhance the analysis of single-cell transcription activities. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: In order to ensure reproducibility, all preprocessed datasets and scripts used for the prediction and figure generation are publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6513669. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
38168839	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	A critical assessment of clustering algorithms to improve cell clustering and identification in single-cell transcriptome study.	Cell clustering is typically the initial step in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses. The performance of clustering considerably impacts the validity and reproducibility of cell identification. A variety of clustering algorithms have been developed for scRNA-seq data. These algorithms generate cell label sets that assign each cell to a cluster. However, different algorithms usually yield different label sets, which can introduce variations in cell-type identification based on the generated label sets. Currently, the performance of these algorithms has not been systematically evaluated in single-cell transcriptome studies. Herein, we performed a critical assessment of seven state-of-the-art clustering algorithms including four deep learning-based clustering algorithms and commonly used methods Seurat, Cosine-based Tanimoto similarity-refined graph for community detection using Leiden's algorithm (CosTaL) and Single-cell consensus clustering (SC3). We used diverse evaluation indices based on 10 different scRNA-seq benchmarks to systematically evaluate their clustering performance. Our results show that CosTaL, Seurat, Deep Embedding for Single-cell Clustering (DESC) and SC3 consistently outperformed Single-Cell Clustering Assessment Framework and scDeepCluster based on nine effectiveness scores. Notably, CosTaL and DESC demonstrated superior performance in clustering specific cell types. The performance of the single-cell Variational Inference tools varied across different datasets, suggesting its sensitivity to certain dataset characteristics. Notably, DESC exhibited promising results for cell subtype identification and capturing cellular heterogeneity. In addition, SC3 requires more memory and exhibits slower computation speed compared to other algorithms for the same dataset. In sum, this study provides useful guidance for selecting appropriate clustering methods in scRNA-seq data analysis.
27139883	2016	Genome biology	Application of single-cell RNA sequencing in optimizing a combinatorial therapeutic strategy in metastatic renal cell carcinoma.	BACKGROUND: Intratumoral heterogeneity hampers the success of marker-based anticancer treatment because the targeted therapy may eliminate a specific subpopulation of tumor cells while leaving others unharmed. Accordingly, a rational strategy minimizing survival of the drug-resistant subpopulation is essential to achieve long-term therapeutic efficacy. RESULTS: Using single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we examine the intratumoral heterogeneity of a pair of primary renal cell carcinoma and its lung metastasis. Activation of drug target pathways demonstrates considerable variability between the primary and metastatic sites, as well as among individual cancer cells within each site. Based on the prediction of multiple drug target pathway activation, we derive a combinatorial regimen co-targeting two mutually exclusive pathways for the metastatic cancer cells. This combinatorial strategy shows significant increase in the treatment efficacy over monotherapy in the experimental validation using patient-derived xenograft platforms in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate the investigational application of single-cell RNA-seq in the design of an anticancer regimen. The approach may overcome intratumoral heterogeneity which hampers the success of precision medicine.
34117739	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	Likelihood-based tests for detecting circadian rhythmicity and differential circadian patterns in transcriptomic applications.	Circadian rhythmicity in transcriptomic profiles has been shown in many physiological processes, and the disruption of circadian patterns has been found to associate with several diseases. In this paper, we developed a series of likelihood-based methods to detect (i) circadian rhythmicity (denoted as LR_rhythmicity) and (ii) differential circadian patterns comparing two experimental conditions (denoted as LR_diff). In terms of circadian rhythmicity detection, we demonstrated that our proposed LR_rhythmicity could better control the type I error rate compared to existing methods under a wide variety of simulation settings. In terms of differential circadian patterns, we developed methods in detecting differential amplitude, differential phase, differential basal level and differential fit, which also successfully controlled the type I error rate. In addition, we demonstrated that the proposed LR_diff could achieve higher statistical power in detecting differential fit, compared to existing methods. The superior performance of LR_rhythmicity and LR_diff was demonstrated in four real data applications, including a brain aging data (gene expression microarray data of human postmortem brain), a time-restricted feeding data (RNA sequencing data of human skeletal muscles) and a scRNAseq data (single cell RNA sequencing data of mouse suprachiasmatic nucleus). An R package for our methods is publicly available on GitHub https://github.com/diffCircadian/diffCircadian.
35048121	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	A universal approach for integrating super large-scale single-cell transcriptomes by exploring gene rankings.	Advancement in single-cell RNA sequencing leads to exponential accumulation of single-cell expression data. However, there is still lack of tools that could integrate these unlimited accumulations of single-cell expression data. Here, we presented a universal approach iSEEEK for integrating super large-scale single-cell expression via exploring expression rankings of top-expressing genes. We developed iSEEEK with 11.9 million single cells. We demonstrated the efficiency of iSEEEK with canonical single-cell downstream tasks on five heterogenous datasets encompassing human and mouse samples. iSEEEK achieved good clustering performance benchmarked against well-annotated cell labels. In addition, iSEEEK could transfer its knowledge learned from large-scale expression data on new dataset that was not involved in its development. iSEEEK enables identification of gene-gene interaction networks that are characteristic of specific cell types. Our study presents a simple and yet effective method to integrate super large-scale single-cell transcriptomes and would facilitate translational single-cell research from bench to bedside.
31697324	2019	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	SigHotSpotter: scRNA-seq-based computational tool to control cell subpopulation phenotypes for cellular rejuvenation strategies.	SUMMARY: Single-cell RNA-sequencing is increasingly employed to characterize disease or ageing cell subpopulation phenotypes. Despite exponential increase in data generation, systematic identification of key regulatory factors for controlling cellular phenotype to enable cell rejuvenation in disease or ageing remains a challenge. Here, we present SigHotSpotter, a computational tool to predict hotspots of signaling pathways responsible for the stable maintenance of cell subpopulation phenotypes, by integrating signaling and transcriptional networks. Targeted perturbation of these signaling hotspots can enable precise control of cell subpopulation phenotypes. SigHotSpotter correctly predicts the signaling hotspots with known experimental validations in different cellular systems. The tool is simple, user-friendly and is available as web-server or as stand-alone software. We believe SigHotSpotter will serve as a general purpose tool for the systematic prediction of signaling hotspots based on single-cell RNA-seq data, and potentiate novel cell rejuvenation strategies in the context of disease and ageing. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: SigHotSpotter is at https://SigHotSpotter.lcsb.uni.lu as a web tool. Source code, example datasets and other information are available at https://gitlab.com/srikanth.ravichandran/sighotspotter. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
39535258	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Deciphering lineage-relevant gene regulatory networks during endoderm formation by InPheRNo-ChIP.	Deciphering the underlying gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that govern early human embryogenesis is critical for understanding developmental mechanisms yet remains challenging due to limited sample availability and the inherent complexity of the biological processes involved. To address this, we developed InPheRNo-ChIP, a computational framework that integrates multimodal data, including RNA-seq, transcription factor (TF)-specific ChIP-seq, and phenotypic labels, to reconstruct phenotype-relevant GRNs associated with endoderm development. The core of this method is a probabilistic graphical model that models the simultaneous effect of TFs on their putative target genes to influence a particular phenotypic outcome. Unlike the majority of existing GRN inference methods that are agnostic to the phenotypic outcomes, InPheRNo-ChIP directly incorporates phenotypic information during GRN inference, enabling the distinction between lineage-specific and general regulatory interactions. We integrated data from three experimental studies and applied InPheRNo-ChIP to infer the GRN governing the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into definitive endoderm. Benchmarking against a scRNA-seq CRISPRi study demonstrated InPheRNo-ChIP's ability to identify regulatory interactions involving endoderm markers FOXA2, SMAD2, and SOX17, outperforming other methods. This highlights the importance of incorporating the phenotypic context during network inference. Furthermore, an ablation study confirms the synergistic contribution of ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, and phenotypic data, highlighting the value of multimodal integration for accurate phenotype-relevant GRN reconstruction.
39402626	2024	Genome biology	SDePER: a hybrid machine learning and regression method for cell-type deconvolution of spatial barcoding-based transcriptomic data.	Spatial barcoding-based transcriptomic (ST) data require deconvolution for cellular-level downstream analysis. Here we present SDePER, a hybrid machine learning and regression method to deconvolve ST data using reference single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. SDePER tackles platform effects between ST and scRNA-seq data, ensuring a linear relationship between them while addressing sparsity and spatial correlations in cell types across capture spots. SDePER estimates cell-type proportions, enabling enhanced resolution tissue mapping by imputing cell-type compositions and gene expressions at unmeasured locations. Applications to simulated data and four real datasets showed SDePER's superior accuracy and robustness over existing methods.
36946415	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Prioritizing prognostic-associated subpopulations and individualized recurrence risk signatures from single-cell transcriptomes of colorectal cancer.	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common gastrointestinal malignancies. There are few recurrence risk signatures for CRC patients. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides a high-resolution platform for prognostic signature detection. However, scRNA-seq is not practical in large cohorts due to its high cost and most single-cell experiments lack clinical phenotype information. Few studies have been reported to use external bulk transcriptome with survival time to guide the detection of key cell subtypes in scRNA-seq data. We proposed scRankXMBD, a computational framework to prioritize prognostic-associated cell subpopulations based on within-cell relative expression orderings of gene pairs from single-cell transcriptomes. scRankXMBD achieves higher precision and concordance compared with five existing methods. Moreover, we developed single-cell gene pair signatures to predict recurrence risk for patients individually. Our work facilitates the application of the rank-based method in scRNA-seq data for prognostic biomarker discovery and precision oncology. scRankXMBD is available at https://github.com/xmuyulab/scRank-XMBD.

39162221	2024	Nucleic acids research	Meiotic chromatin-associated HSF5 is indispensable for pachynema progression and male fertility.	Pachynema progression contributes to the completion of prophase I. Nevertheless, the regulation of this significant meiotic process remains poorly understood. In this study, we identified a novel testis-specific protein HSF5, which regulates pachynema progression during male meiosis in a manner dependent on chromatin-binding. Deficiency of HSF5 results in meiotic arrest and male infertility, characterized as unconventional pachynema arrested at the mid-to-late stage, with extensive spermatocyte apoptosis. Our scRNA-seq data confirmed consistent expressional alterations of certain driver genes (Sycp1, Msh4, Meiob, etc.) crucial for pachynema progression in Hsf5-/- individuals. HSF5 was revealed to primarily bind to promoter regions of such key divers by CUT&Tag analysis. Also, our results demonstrated that HSF5 biologically interacted with SMARCA5, SMARCA4 and SMARCE1, and it could function as a transcription factor for pachynema progression during meiosis. Therefore, our study underscores the importance of the chromatin-associated HSF5 for the differentiation of spermatocytes, improving the protein regulatory network of the pachynema progression.
32657394	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	A Bayesian framework for inter-cellular information sharing improves dscRNA-seq quantification.	MOTIVATION: Droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq (dscRNA-seq) data are being generated at an unprecedented pace, and the accurate estimation of gene-level abundances for each cell is a crucial first step in most dscRNA-seq analyses. When pre-processing the raw dscRNA-seq data to generate a count matrix, care must be taken to account for the potentially large number of multi-mapping locations per read. The sparsity of dscRNA-seq data, and the strong 3' sampling bias, makes it difficult to disambiguate cases where there is no uniquely mapping read to any of the candidate target genes. RESULTS: We introduce a Bayesian framework for information sharing across cells within a sample, or across multiple modalities of data using the same sample, to improve gene quantification estimates for dscRNA-seq data. We use an anchor-based approach to connect cells with similar gene-expression patterns, and learn informative, empirical priors which we provide to alevin's gene multi-mapping resolution algorithm. This improves the quantification estimates for genes with no uniquely mapping reads (i.e. when there is no unique intra-cellular information). We show our new model improves the per cell gene-level estimates and provides a principled framework for information sharing across multiple modalities. We test our method on a combination of simulated and real datasets under various setups. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The information sharing model is included in alevin and is implemented in C++14. It is available as open-source software, under GPL v3, at https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon as of version 1.1.0.
41277528	2025	Nucleic acids research	PBMCpedia: a harmonized PBMC scRNA-seq database with unified mapping and enhanced celltype annotation.	Single-cell transcriptomic studies of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) offer valuable insights into immune states across diverse biological conditions, yet cross-study integration remains difficult due to divergent preprocessing and annotations. PBMCpedia addresses this by uniformly reprocessing 519 samples (over 4.3 million cells) from 24 publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing studies using a standardized pipeline with consistent quality control and hierarchical cell type annotation. Spanning 14 disease contexts, including autoimmune, infectious, and neurodegenerative disorders, as well as healthy controls, PBMCpedia supports metadata-aware comparisons across diseases, cell types, sexes, and age groups. It also includes T-cell receptor/B-cell receptor repertoire data for 75 samples and surface protein measurements for 56 samples, enabling integrative immune profiling at both the transcriptomic and proteogenomic levels. To support exploration and accessibility, we provide an interactive web interface (https://web.ccb.uni-saarland.de/pbmcpedia/) for querying gene expression, marker genes, and pathway enrichment across cell types, conditions, sexes, and age groups. PBMCpedia fills a critical gap by offering a transparent, harmonized, and disease-diverse PBMC resource designed for cross-study immune profiling and discovery.
40830895	2025	Genome biology	A message passing framework for precise cell state identification with scClassify2.	Cell annotation is crucial for downstream exploration. Although many approaches, spanning from classic statistics to large language models, have been developed, most of their focus is on distinct cell types and overlook sequential cell populations. Here, we propose an annotation method, scClassify2, to specifically focus on adjacent cell state identification. By incorporating prior biological knowledge through a novel dual-layer architecture and ordinal regression, scClassify2 achieves competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Besides single-cell RNA-sequencing data, scClassify2 is generalizable from different platforms including subcellular spatial transcriptomics data. We also develop a web server for academic uses.
33226074	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Deep feature extraction of single-cell transcriptomes by generative adversarial network.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers the opportunity to dissect heterogeneous cellular compositions and interrogate the cell-type-specific gene expression patterns across diverse conditions. However, batch effects such as laboratory conditions and individual-variability hinder their usage in cross-condition designs. RESULTS: Here, we present a single-cell Generative Adversarial Network (scGAN) to simultaneously acquire patterns from raw data while minimizing the confounding effect driven by technical artifacts or other factors inherent to the data. Specifically, scGAN models the data likelihood of the raw scRNA-seq counts by projecting each cell onto a latent embedding. Meanwhile, scGAN attempts to minimize the correlation between the latent embeddings and the batch labels across all cells. We demonstrate scGAN on three public scRNA-seq datasets and show that our method confers superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods in forming clusters of known cell types and identifying known psychiatric genes that are associated with major depressive disorder. AVAILABILITYAND IMPLEMENTATION: The scGAN code and the information for the public scRNA-seq datasets are available at https://github.com/li-lab-mcgill/singlecell-deepfeature. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
36661313	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Adversarial dense graph convolutional networks for single-cell classification.	MOTIVATION: In single-cell transcriptomics applications, effective identification of cell types in multicellular organisms and in-depth study of the relationships between genes has become one of the main goals of bioinformatics research. However, data heterogeneity and random noise pose significant difficulties for scRNA-seq data analysis. RESULTS: We have proposed an adversarial dense graph convolutional network architecture for single-cell classification. Specifically, to enhance the representation of higher-order features and the organic combination between features, dense connectivity mechanism and attention-based feature aggregation are introduced for feature learning in convolutional neural networks. To preserve the features of the original data, we use a feature reconstruction module to assist the goal of single-cell classification. In addition, HNNVAT uses virtual adversarial training to improve the generalization and robustness. Experimental results show that our model outperforms the existing classical methods in terms of classification accuracy on benchmark datasets. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code of HNNVAT is available at https://github.com/DisscLab/HNNVAT. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
38552307	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	CTEC: a cross-tabulation ensemble clustering approach for single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis.	MOTIVATION: Cell-type clustering is a crucial first step for single-cell RNA-seq data analysis. However, existing clustering methods often provide different results on cluster assignments with respect to their own data pre-processing, choice of distance metrics, and strategies of feature extraction, thereby limiting their practical applications. RESULTS: We propose Cross-Tabulation Ensemble Clustering (CTEC) method that formulates two re-clustering strategies (distribution- and outlier-based) via cross-tabulation. Benchmarking experiments on five scRNA-Seq datasets illustrate that the proposed CTEC method offers significant improvements over the individual clustering methods. Moreover, CTEC-DB outperforms the state-of-the-art ensemble methods for single-cell data clustering, with 45.4% and 17.1% improvement over the single-cell aggregated from ensemble clustering method (SAFE) and the single-cell aggregated clustering via Mixture model ensemble method (SAME), respectively, on the two-method ensemble test. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code of the benchmark in this work is available at the GitHub repository https://github.com/LWCHN/CTEC.git.
36639202	2023	Genome research	A chromosome-scale epigenetic map of the Hydra genome reveals conserved regulators of cell state.	The epithelial and interstitial stem cells of the freshwater polyp Hydra are the best-characterized stem cell systems in any cnidarian, providing valuable insight into cell type evolution and the origin of stemness in animals. However, little is known about the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that determine how these stem cells are maintained and how they give rise to their diverse differentiated progeny. To address such questions, a thorough understanding of transcriptional regulation in Hydra is needed. To this end, we generated extensive new resources for characterizing transcriptional regulation in Hydra, including new genome assemblies for Hydra oligactis and the AEP strain of Hydra vulgaris, an updated whole-animal single-cell RNA-seq atlas, and genome-wide maps of chromatin interactions, chromatin accessibility, sequence conservation, and histone modifications. These data revealed the existence of large kilobase-scale chromatin interaction domains in the Hydra genome that contain transcriptionally coregulated genes. We also uncovered the transcriptomic profiles of two previously molecularly uncharacterized cell types: isorhiza-type nematocytes and somatic gonad ectoderm. Finally, we identified novel candidate regulators of cell type-specific transcription, several of which have likely been conserved at least since the divergence of Hydra and the jellyfish Clytia hemisphaerica more than 400 million years ago.
40178283	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	CoupleVAE: coupled variational autoencoders for predicting perturbational single-cell RNA sequencing data.	With the rapid advances in single-cell sequencing technology, it is now feasible to conduct in-depth genetic analysis in individual cells. Study on the dynamics of single cells in response to perturbations is of great significance for understanding the functions and behaviors of living organisms. However, the acquisition of post-perturbation cellular states via biological experiments is frequently cost-prohibitive. Predicting the single-cell perturbation responses poses a critical challenge in the field of computational biology. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning method called coupled variational autoencoders (CoupleVAE), devised to predict the postperturbation single-cell RNA-Seq data. CoupleVAE is composed of two coupled VAEs connected by a coupler, initially extracting latent features for controlled and perturbed cells via two encoders, subsequently engaging in mutual translation within the latent space through two nonlinear mappings via a coupler, and ultimately generating controlled and perturbed data by two separate decoders to process the encoded and translated features. CoupleVAE facilitates a more intricate state transformation of single cells within the latent space. Experiments in three real datasets on infection, stimulation and cross-species prediction show that CoupleVAE surpasses the existing comparative models in effectively predicting single-cell RNA-seq data for perturbed cells, achieving superior accuracy.
26527291	2015	Genome biology	ZIFA: Dimensionality reduction for zero-inflated single-cell gene expression analysis.	Single-cell RNA-seq data allows insight into normal cellular function and various disease states through molecular characterization of gene expression on the single cell level. Dimensionality reduction of such high-dimensional data sets is essential for visualization and analysis, but single-cell RNA-seq data are challenging for classical dimensionality-reduction methods because of the prevalence of dropout events, which lead to zero-inflated data. Here, we develop a dimensionality-reduction method, (Z)ero (I)nflated (F)actor (A)nalysis (ZIFA), which explicitly models the dropout characteristics, and show that it improves modeling accuracy on simulated and biological data sets.
29630593	2018	PLoS computational biology	A multitask clustering approach for single-cell RNA-seq analysis in Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been widely applied to discover new cell types by detecting sub-populations in a heterogeneous group of cells. Since scRNA-seq experiments have lower read coverage/tag counts and introduce more technical biases compared to bulk RNA-seq experiments, the limited number of sampled cells combined with the experimental biases and other dataset specific variations presents a challenge to cross-dataset analysis and discovery of relevant biological variations across multiple cell populations. In this paper, we introduce a method of variance-driven multitask clustering of single-cell RNA-seq data (scVDMC) that utilizes multiple single-cell populations from biological replicates or different samples. scVDMC clusters single cells in multiple scRNA-seq experiments of similar cell types and markers but varying expression patterns such that the scRNA-seq data are better integrated than typical pooled analyses which only increase the sample size. By controlling the variance among the cell clusters within each dataset and across all the datasets, scVDMC detects cell sub-populations in each individual experiment with shared cell-type markers but varying cluster centers among all the experiments. Applied to two real scRNA-seq datasets with several replicates and one large-scale droplet-based dataset on three patient samples, scVDMC more accurately detected cell populations and known cell markers than pooled clustering and other recently proposed scRNA-seq clustering methods. In the case study applied to in-house Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (RDEB) scRNA-seq data, scVDMC revealed several new cell types and unknown markers validated by flow cytometry.

30445495	2019	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	GRNBoost2 and Arboreto: efficient and scalable inference of gene regulatory networks.	SUMMARY: Inferring a Gene Regulatory Network (GRN) from gene expression data is a computationally expensive task, exacerbated by increasing data sizes due to advances in high-throughput gene profiling technology, such as single-cell RNA-seq. To equip researchers with a toolset to infer GRNs from large expression datasets, we propose GRNBoost2 and the Arboreto framework. GRNBoost2 is an efficient algorithm for regulatory network inference using gradient boosting, based on the GENIE3 architecture. Arboreto is a computational framework that scales up GRN inference algorithms complying with this architecture. Arboreto includes both GRNBoost2 and an improved implementation of GENIE3, as a user-friendly open source Python package.

36070866	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	SCDD: a novel single-cell RNA-seq imputation method with diffusion and denoising.	Single-cell sequencing technologies are widely used to discover the evolutionary relationships and the differences in cells. Since dropout events may frustrate the analysis, many imputation approaches for single-cell RNA-seq data have appeared in previous attempts. However, previous imputation attempts usually suffer from the over-smooth problem, which may bring limited improvement or negative effect for the downstream analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data. To solve this difficulty, we propose a novel two-stage diffusion-denoising method called SCDD for large-scale single-cell RNA-seq imputation in this paper. We introduce the diffusion i.e. a direct imputation strategy using the expression of similar cells for potential dropout sites, to perform the initial imputation at first. After the diffusion, a joint model integrated with graph convolutional neural network and contractive autoencoder is developed to generate superposition states of similar cells, from which we restore the original states and remove the noise introduced by the diffusion. The final experimental results indicate that SCDD could effectively suppress the over-smooth problem and remarkably improve the effect of single-cell RNA-seq downstream analysis, including clustering and trajectory analysis.
38366803	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	scEVOLVE: cell-type incremental annotation without forgetting for single-cell RNA-seq data.	The evolution in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has opened a new avenue for researchers to inspect cellular heterogeneity with single-cell precision. One crucial aspect of this technology is cell-type annotation, which is fundamental for any subsequent analysis in single-cell data mining. Recently, the scientific community has seen a surge in the development of automatic annotation methods aimed at this task. However, these methods generally operate at a steady-state total cell-type capacity, significantly restricting the cell annotation systems'capacity for continuous knowledge acquisition. Furthermore, creating a unified scRNA-seq annotation system remains challenged by the need to progressively expand its understanding of ever-increasing cell-type concepts derived from a continuous data stream. In response to these challenges, this paper presents a novel and challenging setting for annotation, namely cell-type incremental annotation. This concept is designed to perpetually enhance cell-type knowledge, gleaned from continuously incoming data. This task encounters difficulty with data stream samples that can only be observed once, leading to catastrophic forgetting. To address this problem, we introduce our breakthrough methodology termed scEVOLVE, an incremental annotation method. This innovative approach is built upon the methodology of contrastive sample replay combined with the fundamental principle of partition confidence maximization. Specifically, we initially retain and replay sections of the old data in each subsequent training phase, then establish a unique prototypical learning objective to mitigate the cell-type imbalance problem, as an alternative to using cross-entropy. To effectively emulate a model that trains concurrently with complete data, we introduce a cell-type decorrelation strategy that efficiently scatters feature representations of each cell type uniformly. We constructed the scEVOLVE framework with simplicity and ease of integration into most deep softmax-based single-cell annotation methods. Thorough experiments conducted on a range of meticulously constructed benchmarks consistently prove that our methodology can incrementally learn numerous cell types over an extended period, outperforming other strategies that fail quickly. As far as our knowledge extends, this is the first attempt to propose and formulate an end-to-end algorithm framework to address this new, practical task. Additionally, scEVOLVE, coded in Python using the Pytorch machine-learning library, is freely accessible at https://github.com/aimeeyaoyao/scEVOLVE.
29538379	2018	PLoS computational biology	iDREM: Interactive visualization of dynamic regulatory networks.	The Dynamic Regulatory Events Miner (DREM) software reconstructs dynamic regulatory networks by integrating static protein-DNA interaction data with time series gene expression data. In recent years, several additional types of high-throughput time series data have been profiled when studying biological processes including time series miRNA expression, proteomics, epigenomics and single cell RNA-Seq. Combining all available time series and static datasets in a unified model remains an important challenge and goal. To address this challenge we have developed a new version of DREM termed interactive DREM (iDREM). iDREM provides support for all data types mentioned above and combines them with existing interaction data to reconstruct networks that can lead to novel hypotheses on the function and timing of regulators. Users can interactively visualize and query the resulting model. We showcase the functionality of the new tool by applying it to microglia developmental data from multiple labs.
37791883	2024	Nucleic acids research	CROST: a comprehensive repository of spatial transcriptomics.	The development of spatial transcriptome sequencing technology has revolutionized our comprehension of complex tissues and propelled life and health sciences into an era of spatial omics. However, the current availability of databases for accessing and analyzing spatial transcriptomic data is limited. In response, we have established CROST (https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/crost), a comprehensive repository of spatial transcriptomics. CROST encompasses high-quality samples and houses 182 spatial transcriptomic datasets from diverse species, organs, and diseases, comprising 1033 sub-datasets and 48 043 tumor-related spatially variable genes (SVGs). Additionally, it encompasses a standardized spatial transcriptome data processing pipeline, integrates single-cell RNA sequencing deconvolution spatial transcriptomics data, and evaluates correlation, colocalization, intercellular communication, and biological function annotation analyses. Moreover, CROST integrates the transcriptome, epigenome, and genome to explore tumor-associated SVGs and provides a comprehensive understanding of their roles in cancer progression and prognosis. Furthermore, CROST provides two online tools, single-sample gene set enrichment analysis and SpatialAP, for users to annotate and analyze the uploaded spatial transcriptomics data. The user-friendly interface of CROST facilitates browsing, searching, analyzing, visualizing, and downloading desired information. Collectively, CROST offers fresh and comprehensive insights into tissue structure and a foundation for understanding multiple biological mechanisms in diseases, particularly in tumor tissues.
39402696	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Clustering scRNA-seq data with the cross-view collaborative information fusion strategy.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has revolutionized biological research by enabling high-throughput, cellular-resolution gene expression profiling. A critical step in scRNA-seq data analysis is cell clustering, which supports downstream analyses. However, the high-dimensional and sparse nature of scRNA-seq data poses significant challenges to existing clustering methods. Furthermore, integrating gene expression information with potential cell structure data remains largely unexplored. Here, we present scCFIB, a novel information bottleneck (IB)-based clustering algorithm that leverages the power of IB for efficient processing of high-dimensional sparse data and incorporates a cross-view fusion strategy to achieve robust cell clustering. scCFIB constructs a multi-feature space by establishing two distinct views from the original features. We then formulate the cell clustering problem as a target loss function within the IB framework, employing a collaborative information fusion strategy. To further optimize scCFIB's performance, we introduce a novel sequential optimization approach through an iterative process. Benchmarking against established methods on diverse scRNA-seq datasets demonstrates that scCFIB achieves superior performance in scRNA-seq data clustering tasks. Availability: the source code is publicly available on GitHub: https://github.com/weixiaojiao/scCFIB.
35862429	2022	PLoS computational biology	Haisu: Hierarchically supervised nonlinear dimensionality reduction.	"We propose a novel strategy for incorporating hierarchical supervised label information into nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques. Specifically, we extend t-SNE, UMAP, and PHATE to include known or predicted class labels and demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on multiple single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. Our approach, ""Haisu,"" is applicable across domains and methods of nonlinear dimensionality reduction. In general, the mathematical effect of Haisu can be summarized as a variable perturbation of the high dimensional space in which the original data is observed. We thereby preserve the core characteristics of the visualization method and only change the manifold to respect known or assumed class labels when provided. Our strategy is designed to aid in the discovery and understanding of underlying patterns in a dataset that is heavily influenced by parent-child relationships. We show that using our approach can also help in semi-supervised settings where labels are known for only some datapoints (for instance when only a fraction of the cells are labeled). In summary, Haisu extends existing popular visualization methods to enable a user to incorporate labels known a priori into a visualization, including their hierarchical relationships as defined by a user input graph."
27153638	2016	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Beta-Poisson model for single-cell RNA-seq data analyses.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA-sequencing technology allows detection of gene expression at the single-cell level. One typical feature of the data is a bimodality in the cellular distribution even for highly expressed genes, primarily caused by a proportion of non-expressing cells. The standard and the over-dispersed gamma-Poisson models that are commonly used in bulk-cell RNA-sequencing are not able to capture this property. RESULTS: We introduce a beta-Poisson mixture model that can capture the bimodality of the single-cell gene expression distribution. We further integrate the model into the generalized linear model framework in order to perform differential expression analyses. The whole analytical procedure is called BPSC. The results from several real single-cell RNA-seq datasets indicate that  approximately 90% of the transcripts are well characterized by the beta-Poisson model; the model-fit from BPSC is better than the fit of the standard gamma-Poisson model in > 80% of the transcripts. Moreover, in differential expression analyses of simulated and real datasets, BPSC performs well against edgeR, a conventional method widely used in bulk-cell RNA-sequencing data, and against scde and MAST, two recent methods specifically designed for single-cell RNA-seq data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: An R package BPSC for model fitting and differential expression analyses of single-cell RNA-seq data is available under GPL-3 license at https://github.com/nghiavtr/BPSC CONTACT: yudi.pawitan@ki.se or mattias.rantalainen@ki.se SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
35524494	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	A parameter-free deep embedded clustering method for single-cell RNA-seq data.	Clustering analysis is widely used in single-cell ribonucleic acid (RNA)-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to discover cell heterogeneity and cell states. While many clustering methods have been developed for scRNA-seq analysis, most of these methods require to provide the number of clusters. However, it is not easy to know the exact number of cell types in advance, and experienced determination is not always reliable. Here, we have developed ADClust, an automatic deep embedding clustering method for scRNA-seq data, which can accurately cluster cells without requiring a predefined number of clusters. Specifically, ADClust first obtains low-dimensional representation through pre-trained autoencoder and uses the representations to cluster cells into initial micro-clusters. The clusters are then compared in between by a statistical test, and similar micro-clusters are merged into larger clusters. According to the clustering, cell representations are updated so that each cell will be pulled toward centers of its assigned cluster and similar clusters, while cells are separated to keep distances between clusters. This is accomplished through jointly optimizing the carefully designed clustering and autoencoder loss functions. This merging process continues until convergence. ADClust was tested on 11 real scRNA-seq datasets and was shown to outperform existing methods in terms of both clustering performance and the accuracy on the number of the determined clusters. More importantly, our model provides high speed and scalability for large datasets.
33003206	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	A spectral clustering with self-weighted multiple kernel learning method for single-cell RNA-seq data.	Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data widely exist in bioinformatics. It is crucial to devise a distance metric for scRNA-seq data. Almost all existing clustering methods based on spectral clustering algorithms work in three separate steps: similarity graph construction; continuous labels learning; discretization of the learned labels by k-means clustering. However, this common practice has potential flaws that may lead to severe information loss and degradation of performance. Furthermore, the performance of a kernel method is largely determined by the selected kernel; a self-weighted multiple kernel learning model can help choose the most suitable kernel for scRNA-seq data. To this end, we propose to automatically learn similarity information from data. We present a new clustering method in the form of a multiple kernel combination that can directly discover groupings in scRNA-seq data. The main proposition is that automatically learned similarity information from scRNA-seq data is used to transform the candidate solution into a new solution that better approximates the discrete one. The proposed model can be efficiently solved by the standard support vector machine (SVM) solvers. Experiments on benchmark scRNA-Seq data validate the superior performance of the proposed model. Spectral clustering with multiple kernels is implemented in Matlab, licensed under Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and freely available from the Github website, https://github.com/Cuteu/SMSC/.
39152499	2024	Genome biology	scParser: sparse representation learning for scalable single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis.	The rapid rise in the availability and scale of scRNA-seq data needs scalable methods for integrative analysis. Though many methods for data integration have been developed, few focus on understanding the heterogeneous effects of biological conditions across different cell populations in integrative analysis. Our proposed scalable approach, scParser, models the heterogeneous effects from biological conditions, which unveils the key mechanisms by which gene expression contributes to phenotypes. Notably, the extended scParser pinpoints biological processes in cell subpopulations that contribute to disease pathogenesis. scParser achieves favorable performance in cell clustering compared to state-of-the-art methods and has a broad and diverse applicability.

RNA velocity, which reflects the balance between nascent RNA synthesis and mature RNA degradation, provides a kinetic perspective to explore gene expression dynamics and cellular state transitions, offering profound insights into diverse biological processes and disease mechanisms. Deciphering RNA velocity patterns across cell types and contexts will deepen our understanding of the temporal logic of gene regulation and facilitating the discovery of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Here, we present RNAPaceDB (http://biocclab.cn/RNAPaceDB/), a dedicated database to dissect RNA velocity across diverse cell types.

32152598	2020	Nature biotechnology	Dissecting cellular crosstalk by sequencing physically interacting cells.	Crosstalk between neighboring cells underlies many biological processes, including cell signaling, proliferation and differentiation. Current single-cell genomic technologies profile each cell separately after tissue dissociation, losing information on cell-cell interactions. In the present study, we present an approach for sequencing physically interacting cells (PIC-seq), which combines cell sorting of physically interacting cells (PICs) with single-cell RNA-sequencing. Using computational modeling, PIC-seq systematically maps in situ cellular interactions and characterizes their molecular crosstalk. We apply PIC-seq to interrogate diverse interactions including immune-epithelial PICs in neonatal murine lungs. Focusing on interactions between T cells and dendritic cells (DCs) in vitro and in vivo, we map T cell-DC interaction preferences, and discover regulatory T cells as a major T cell subtype interacting with DCs in mouse draining lymph nodes. Analysis of T cell-DC pairs reveals an interaction-specific program between pathogen-presenting migratory DCs and T cells. PIC-seq provides a direct and broadly applicable technology to characterize intercellular interaction-specific pathways at high resolution.
31510671	2019	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Block HSIC Lasso: model-free biomarker detection for ultra-high dimensional data.	MOTIVATION: Finding non-linear relationships between biomolecules and a biological outcome is computationally expensive and statistically challenging. Existing methods have important drawbacks, including among others lack of parsimony, non-convexity and computational overhead. Here we propose block HSIC Lasso, a non-linear feature selector that does not present the previous drawbacks. RESULTS: We compare block HSIC Lasso to other state-of-the-art feature selection techniques in both synthetic and real data, including experiments over three common types of genomic data: gene-expression microarrays, single-cell RNA sequencing and genome-wide association studies. In all cases, we observe that features selected by block HSIC Lasso retain more information about the underlying biology than those selected by other techniques. As a proof of concept, we applied block HSIC Lasso to a single-cell RNA sequencing experiment on mouse hippocampus. We discovered that many genes linked in the past to brain development and function are involved in the biological differences between the types of neurons. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Block HSIC Lasso is implemented in the Python 2/3 package pyHSICLasso, available on PyPI. Source code is available on GitHub (https://github.com/riken-aip/pyHSICLasso). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
38809943	2024	PLoS computational biology	Clustering and visualization of single-cell RNA-seq data using path metrics.	Recent advances in single-cell technologies have enabled high-resolution characterization of tissue and cancer compositions. Although numerous tools for dimension reduction and clustering are available for single-cell data analyses, these methods often fail to simultaneously preserve local cluster structure and global data geometry. To address these challenges, we developed a novel analyses framework, Single-Cell Path Metrics Profiling (scPMP), using power-weighted path metrics, which measure distances between cells in a data-driven way. Unlike Euclidean distance and other commonly used distance metrics, path metrics are density sensitive and respect the underlying data geometry. By combining path metrics with multidimensional scaling, a low dimensional embedding of the data is obtained which preserves both the global data geometry and cluster structure. We evaluate the method both for clustering quality and geometric fidelity, and it outperforms current scRNAseq clustering algorithms on a wide range of benchmarking data sets.
30371680	2018	Nature biotechnology	Identification of spatially associated subpopulations by combining scRNAseq and sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization data.	How intrinsic gene-regulatory networks interact with a cell's spatial environment to define its identity remains poorly understood. We developed an approach to distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic effects on global gene expression by integrating analysis of sequencing-based and imaging-based single-cell transcriptomic profiles, using cross-platform cell type mapping combined with a hidden Markov random field model. We applied this approach to dissect the cell-type- and spatial-domain-associated heterogeneity in the mouse visual cortex region. Our analysis identified distinct spatially associated, cell-type-independent signatures in the glutamatergic and astrocyte cell compartments. Using these signatures to analyze single-cell RNA sequencing data, we identified previously unknown spatially associated subpopulations, which were validated by comparison with anatomical structures and Allen Brain Atlas images.
39103939	2024	Genome biology	STdGCN: spatial transcriptomic cell-type deconvolution using graph convolutional networks.	Spatially resolved transcriptomics integrates high-throughput transcriptome measurements with preserved spatial cellular organization information. However, many technologies cannot reach single-cell resolution. We present STdGCN, a graph model leveraging single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) as reference for cell-type deconvolution in spatial transcriptomic (ST) data. STdGCN incorporates expression profiles from scRNA-seq and spatial localization from ST data for deconvolution. Extensive benchmarking on multiple datasets demonstrates that STdGCN outperforms 17 state-of-the-art models. In a human breast cancer Visium dataset, STdGCN delineates stroma, lymphocytes, and cancer cells, aiding tumor microenvironment analysis. In human heart ST data, STdGCN identifies changes in endothelial-cardiomyocyte communications during tissue development.
41231963	2025	PLoS computational biology	Library size-stabilized metacells construction enhances co-expression network analysis in single-cell data.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) deciphers cell type-specific co-expression networks to resolve biological functions but remains constrained by data sparsity and compositional biases. Conventional metacells construction strategies mitigate sparsity by aggregating transcriptionally similar cells but often neglect systematic biases introduced by compositional data. This problem leads to spurious co-expression correlations and obscuring biologically meaningful interactions. Through mathematical modeling and simulations, we demonstrate that uncontrolled library size variance in traditional metacells inflates false-positive correlations and distorts co-expression networks. Here, we present LSMetacell (Library Size-stabilized Metacells), a computational framework that explicitly stabilizes library sizes across metacells to reduce compositional noise while preserving cellular heterogeneity. LSMetacell addresses this by stabilizing library sizes during metacells aggregation, thereby enhancing the accuracy of downstream analyses such as Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA). Applied to a postmortem Alzheimer's disease brain scRNA-seq dataset, LSMetacell revealed robust, cell type-specific co-expression modules enriched for disease-relevant pathways, outperforming the conventional metacells approach. Our work establishes a principled strategy for resolving compositional biases in scRNA-seq data, advancing the reliability of co-expression network inference in studying complex biological systems. This framework provides a generalizable solution for improving transcriptional analyses in single-cell studies.
38197309	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Integrated bulk and single-cell transcriptomes reveal pyroptotic signature in prognosis and therapeutic options of hepatocellular carcinoma by combining deep learning.	Although some pyroptosis-related (PR) prognostic models for cancers have been reported, pyroptosis-based features have not been fully discovered at the single-cell level in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, by deeply integrating single-cell and bulk transcriptome data, we systematically investigated significance of the shared pyroptotic signature at both single-cell and bulk levels in HCC prognosis. Based on the pyroptotic signature, a robust PR risk system was constructed to quantify the prognostic risk of individual patient. To further verify capacity of the pyroptotic signature on predicting patients' prognosis, an attention mechanism-based deep neural network classification model was constructed. The mechanisms of prognostic difference in the patients with distinct PR risk were dissected on tumor stemness, cancer pathways, transcriptional regulation, immune infiltration and cell communications. A nomogram model combining PR risk with clinicopathologic data was constructed to evaluate the prognosis of individual patients in clinic. The PR risk could also evaluate therapeutic response to neoadjuvant therapies in HCC patients. In conclusion, the constructed PR risk system enables a comprehensive assessment of tumor microenvironment characteristics, accurate prognosis prediction and rational therapeutic options in HCC.
39075577	2024	Genome biology	Mining alternative splicing patterns in scRNA-seq data using scASfind.	Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) is widely used for transcriptome profiling, but most analyses focus on gene-level events, with less attention devoted to alternative splicing. Here, we present scASfind, a novel computational method to allow for quantitative analysis of cell type-specific splicing events using full-length scRNA-seq data. ScASfind utilizes an efficient data structure to store the percent spliced-in value for each splicing event. This makes it possible to exhaustively search for patterns among all differential splicing events, allowing us to identify marker events, mutually exclusive events, and events involving large blocks of exons that are specific to one or more cell types.
39311699	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	COFFEE: consensus single cell-type specific inference for gene regulatory networks.	The inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is crucial to understanding the regulatory mechanisms that govern biological processes. GRNs may be represented as edges in a graph, and hence, it have been inferred computationally for scRNA-seq data. A wisdom of crowds approach to integrate edges from several GRNs to create one composite GRN has demonstrated improved performance when compared with individual algorithm implementations on bulk RNA-seq and microarray data. In an effort to extend this approach to scRNA-seq data, we present COFFEE (COnsensus single cell-type speciFic inFerence for gEnE regulatory networks), a Borda voting-based consensus algorithm that integrates information from 10 established GRN inference methods. We conclude that COFFEE has improved performance across synthetic, curated, and experimental datasets when compared with baseline methods. Additionally, we show that a modified version of COFFEE can be leveraged to improve performance on newer cell-type specific GRN inference methods. Overall, our results demonstrate that consensus-based methods with pertinent modifications continue to be valuable for GRN inference at the single cell level. While COFFEE is benchmarked on 10 algorithms, it is a flexible strategy that can incorporate any set of GRN inference algorithms according to user preference. A Python implementation of COFFEE may be found on GitHub: https://github.com/lodimk2/coffee.
40156041	2025	Genome biology	Benchmarking spatial transcriptomics technologies with the multi-sample SpatialBenchVisium dataset.	BACKGROUND: Spatial transcriptomics allows gene expression to be measured within complex tissue contexts. Among the array of spatial capture technologies available is 10x Genomics' Visium platform, a popular method which enables transcriptome-wide profiling of tissue sections. Visium offers a range of sample handling and library construction methods which introduces a need for benchmarking to compare data quality and assess how well the technology can recover expected tissue features and biological signatures. RESULTS: Here we present SpatialBenchVisium, a unique reference dataset generated from spleen tissue of mice responding to malaria infection spanning several tissue preparation protocols (both fresh frozen and FFPE, with either manual or CytAssist tissue placement). We note better quality control metrics in reference samples prepared using probe-based capture methods, particularly those processed with CytAssist, validating the improvement in data quality produced with the platform. Our analysis of replicate samples extends to explore spatially variable gene detection, the outcomes of clustering and cell deconvolution using matched single-cell RNA-sequencing data and publicly available reference data to identify cell types and tissue regions expected in the spleen. Multi-sample differential expression analysis recovered known gene signatures related to biological sex or gene knockout.
40481363	2025	Nature methods	CellNEST reveals cell-cell relay networks using attention mechanisms on spatial transcriptomics.	Dysregulation of communication between cells mediates complex diseases such as cancer and diabetes; however, detecting cell-cell communication at scale remains one of the greatest challenges in transcriptomics. Most current single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics computational approaches exhibit high false-positive rates, do not detect signals between individual cells and only identify single ligand-receptor communication. To overcome these challenges, we developed Cell Neural Networks on Spatial Transcriptomics (CellNEST) to decipher patterns of communication. Our model introduces a new type of relay-network communication detection that identifies putative ligand-receptor-ligand-receptor communication. CellNEST detects T cell homing signals in human lymph nodes, identifies aggressive cancer communication in lung adenocarcinoma and colorectal cancer, and predicts new patterns of communication that may act as relay networks in pancreatic cancer. Along with CellNEST, we provide a web-based, interactive visualization method to explore in situ communication. CellNEST is available at https://github.com/schwartzlab-methods/CellNEST .
41168487	2025	Nature methods	Nicheformer: a foundation model for single-cell and spatial omics.	Tissue makeup depends on the local cellular microenvironment. Spatial single-cell genomics enables scalable and unbiased interrogation of these interactions. Here we introduce Nicheformer, a transformer-based foundation model trained on both human and mouse dissociated single-cell and targeted spatial transcriptomics data. Pretrained on SpatialCorpus-110M, a curated collection of over 57 million dissociated and 53 million spatially resolved cells across 73 tissues on cellular reconstruction, Nicheformer learns cell representations that capture spatial context. It excels in linear-probing and fine-tuning scenarios for a newly designed set of downstream tasks, in particular spatial composition prediction and spatial label prediction. Critically, we show that models trained only on dissociated data fail to recover the complexity of spatial microenvironments, underscoring the need for multiscale integration. Nicheformer enables the prediction of the spatial context of dissociated cells, allowing the transfer of rich spatial information to scRNA-seq datasets. Overall, Nicheformer sets the stage for the next generation of machine-learning models in spatial single-cell analysis.
37387155	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Robust reconstruction of single-cell RNA-seq data with iterative gene weight updates.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA-sequencing technologies have greatly enhanced our understanding of heterogeneous cell populations and underlying regulatory processes. However, structural (spatial or temporal) relations between cells are lost during cell dissociation. These relations are crucial for identifying associated biological processes. Many existing tissue-reconstruction algorithms use prior information about subsets of genes that are informative with respect to the structure or process to be reconstructed. When such information is not available, and in the general case when the input genes code for multiple processes, including being susceptible to noise, biological reconstruction is often computationally challenging. RESULTS: We propose an algorithm that iteratively identifies manifold-informative genes using existing reconstruction algorithms for single-cell RNA-seq data as subroutine. We show that our algorithm improves the quality of tissue reconstruction for diverse synthetic and real scRNA-seq data, including data from the mammalian intestinal epithelium and liver lobules. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The code and data for benchmarking are available at github.com/syq2012/iterative_weight_update_for_reconstruction.
36413065	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	GeoWaVe: geometric median clustering with weighted voting for ensemble clustering of cytometry data.	MOTIVATION: Clustering is an unsupervised method for identifying structure in unlabelled data. In the context of cytometry, it is typically used to categorize cells into subpopulations of similar phenotypes. However, clustering is greatly dependent on hyperparameters and the data to which it is applied as each algorithm makes different assumptions and generates a different 'view' of the dataset. As such, the choice of clustering algorithm can significantly influence results, and there is often not one preferred method but different insights to be obtained from different methods. To overcome these limitations, consensus approaches are needed that directly address the effect of competing algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, consensus clustering algorithms designed specifically for the analysis of cytometry data are lacking. RESULTS: We present a novel ensemble clustering methodology based on geometric median clustering with weighted voting (GeoWaVe). Compared to graph ensemble clustering methods that have gained popularity in single-cell RNA sequencing analysis, GeoWaVe performed favourably on different sets of high-dimensional mass and flow cytometry data. Our findings provide proof of concept for the power of consensus methods to make the analysis, visualization and interpretation of cytometry data more robust and reproducible. The wide availability of ensemble clustering methods is likely to have a profound impact on our understanding of cellular responses, clinical conditions and therapeutic and diagnostic options. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: GeoWaVe is available as part of the CytoCluster package https://github.com/burtonrj/CytoCluster and published on the Python Package Index https://pypi.org/project/cytocluster. Benchmarking data described are available from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7134723. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

39951474	2025	PLoS computational biology	Integrating multiscale mathematical modeling and multidimensional data reveals the effects of epigenetic instability on acquired drug resistance in cancer.	Biological and dynamic mechanisms by which Drug-tolerant persister (DTP) cells contribute to the development of acquired drug resistance have not been fully elucidated. Here, by integrating multidimensional data from drug-treated PC9 cells, we developed a novel multiscale mathematical model from an evolutionary perspective that encompasses epigenetic and cellular population dynamics. By coupling stochastic simulation with quantitative analysis, we identified epigenetic instability as the most prominent kinetic feature related to the emergence of DTP cell subpopulations and the effectiveness of intermittent treatment. Moreover, we revealed the optimal schedule for intermittent treatment, including the optimal area for therapeutic time and drug holidays. By leveraging single-cell RNA-seq data characterizing the drug tolerance of lung cancer, we validated the predictions made by our model and further revealed previously unrecognized biological features of DTP cells, such as cell autophagy and migration, as well as new biomarker genes of therapeutic tolerance. Our work not only provides a paradigm for the integration of multiscale mathematical models with newly emerging genomics data but also improves our understanding of the crucial roles of DTP cells and offers guidance for developing new intermittent treatment strategies against acquired drug resistance in cancer.
31754020	2019	Genome research	Murine single-cell RNA-seq reveals cell-identity- and tissue-specific trajectories of aging.	Aging is a pleiotropic process affecting many aspects of mammalian physiology. Mammals are composed of distinct cell type identities and tissue environments, but the influence of these cell identities and environments on the trajectory of aging in individual cells remains unclear. Here, we performed single-cell RNA-seq on >50,000 individual cells across three tissues in young and old mice to allow for direct comparison of aging phenotypes across cell types. We found transcriptional features of aging common across many cell types, as well as features of aging unique to each type. Leveraging matrix factorization and optimal transport methods, we found that both cell identities and tissue environments exert influence on the trajectory and magnitude of aging, with cell identity influence predominating. These results suggest that aging manifests with unique directionality and magnitude across the diverse cell identities in mammals.
32138770	2020	Genome biology	Decontamination of ambient RNA in single-cell RNA-seq with DecontX.	Droplet-based microfluidic devices have become widely used to perform single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). However, ambient RNA present in the cell suspension can be aberrantly counted along with a cell's native mRNA and result in cross-contamination of transcripts between different cell populations. DecontX is a novel Bayesian method to estimate and remove contamination in individual cells. DecontX accurately predicts contamination levels in a mouse-human mixture dataset and removes aberrant expression of marker genes in PBMC datasets. We also compare the contamination levels between four different scRNA-seq protocols. Overall, DecontX can be incorporated into scRNA-seq workflows to improve downstream analyses.
30763315	2019	PLoS computational biology	IRIS-EDA: An integrated RNA-Seq interpretation system for gene expression data analysis.	Next-Generation Sequencing has made available substantial amounts of large-scale Omics data, providing unprecedented opportunities to understand complex biological systems. Specifically, the value of RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) data has been confirmed in inferring how gene regulatory systems will respond under various conditions (bulk data) or cell types (single-cell data). RNA-Seq can generate genome-scale gene expression profiles that can be further analyzed using correlation analysis, co-expression analysis, clustering, differential gene expression (DGE), among many other studies. While these analyses can provide invaluable information related to gene expression, integration and interpretation of the results can prove challenging. Here we present a tool called IRIS-EDA, which is a Shiny web server for expression data analysis. It provides a straightforward and user-friendly platform for performing numerous computational analyses on user-provided RNA-Seq or Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) data. Specifically, three commonly used R packages (edgeR, DESeq2, and limma) are implemented in the DGE analysis with seven unique experimental design functionalities, including a user-specified design matrix option. Seven discovery-driven methods and tools (correlation analysis, heatmap, clustering, biclustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)) are provided for gene expression exploration which is useful for designing experimental hypotheses and determining key factors for comprehensive DGE analysis. Furthermore, this platform integrates seven visualization tools in a highly interactive manner, for improved interpretation of the analyses. It is noteworthy that, for the first time, IRIS-EDA provides a framework to expedite submission of data and results to NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus following the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) Data Principles. IRIS-EDA is freely available at http://bmbl.sdstate.edu/IRIS/.
28967890	2017	Nature methods	Long-term expansion of alveolar stem cells derived from human iPS cells in organoids.	The stable expansion of tissue-specific stem cells in vitro has contributed to research on several organs. Alveolar epithelial type II (AT2) cells function as tissue stem cells in the lung, but robust models for studying human AT2 cells are lacking. Here we report a method for the efficient generation and long-term expansion of alveolar organoids (AOs) harboring SFTPC(+) alveolar stem cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). hiPSC-derived SFTPC(+) cells self-renewed, with transcriptomes and morphology consistent with those of AT2 cells, and were able to differentiate into alveolar epithelial type I (AT1)-like cells. Single-cell RNA-seq of SFTPC(+) cells and their progenitors demonstrated that their differentiation process and cellular heterogeneity resembled those of developing AT2 cells in vivo. AOs were applicable to drug toxicology studies recapitulating AT2-cell-specific phenotypes. Our methods can help scientists overcome the limitations of current approaches to the modeling of human alveoli and should be useful for disease modeling and regenerative medicine.
31925417	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	SCDC: bulk gene expression deconvolution by multiple single-cell RNA sequencing references.	Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enable characterization of transcriptomic profiles with single-cell resolution and circumvent averaging artifacts associated with traditional bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. Here, we propose SCDC, a deconvolution method for bulk RNA-seq that leverages cell-type specific gene expression profiles from multiple scRNA-seq reference datasets. SCDC adopts an ENSEMBLE method to integrate deconvolution results from different scRNA-seq datasets that are produced in different laboratories and at different times, implicitly addressing the problem of batch-effect confounding. SCDC is benchmarked against existing methods using both in silico generated pseudo-bulk samples and experimentally mixed cell lines, whose known cell-type compositions serve as ground truths. We show that SCDC outperforms existing methods with improved accuracy of cell-type decomposition under both settings. To illustrate how the ENSEMBLE framework performs in complex tissues under different scenarios, we further apply our method to a human pancreatic islet dataset and a mouse mammary gland dataset. SCDC returns results that are more consistent with experimental designs and that reproduce more significant associations between cell-type proportions and measured phenotypes.
36253792	2022	Genome biology	Evaluation of cell-cell interaction methods by integrating single-cell RNA sequencing data with spatial information.	BACKGROUND: Cell-cell interactions are important for information exchange between different cells, which are the fundamental basis of many biological processes. Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enable the characterization of cell-cell interactions using computational methods. However, it is hard to evaluate these methods since no ground truth is provided. Spatial transcriptomics (ST) data profiles the relative position of different cells. We propose that the spatial distance suggests the interaction tendency of different cell types, thus could be used for evaluating cell-cell interaction tools. RESULTS: We benchmark 16 cell-cell interaction methods by integrating scRNA-seq with ST data. We characterize cell-cell interactions into short-range and long-range interactions using spatial distance distributions between ligands and receptors. Based on this classification, we define the distance enrichment score and apply an evaluation workflow to 16 cell-cell interaction tools using 15 simulated and 5 real scRNA-seq and ST datasets. We also compare the consistency of the results from single tools with the commonly identified interactions. Our results suggest that the interactions predicted by different tools are highly dynamic, and the statistical-based methods show overall better performance than network-based methods and ST-based methods. CONCLUSIONS: Our study presents a comprehensive evaluation of cell-cell interaction tools for scRNA-seq. CellChat, CellPhoneDB, NicheNet, and ICELLNET show overall better performance than other tools in terms of consistency with spatial tendency and software scalability. We recommend using results from at least two methods to ensure the accuracy of identified interactions. We have packaged the benchmark workflow with detailed documentation at GitHub ( https://github.com/wanglabtongji/CCI ).
30668675	2019	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	The ReproGenomics Viewer: a multi-omics and cross-species resource compatible with single-cell studies for the reproductive science community.	MOTIVATION: Recent advances in transcriptomics have enabled unprecedented insight into gene expression analysis at a single-cell resolution. While it is anticipated that the number of publications based on such technologies will increase in the next decade, there is currently no public resource to centralize and enable scientists to explore single-cell datasets published in the field of reproductive biology. RESULTS: Here, we present a major update of the ReproGenomics Viewer, a cross-species and cross-technology web-based resource of manually-curated sequencing datasets related to reproduction. The redesign of the ReproGenomics Viewer's architecture is accompanied by significant growth of the database content including several landmark single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets. The implementation of additional tools enables users to visualize and browse the complex, high-dimensional data now being generated in the reproductive field. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The ReproGenomics Viewer resource is freely accessible at http://rgv.genouest.org. The website is implemented in Python, JavaScript and MongoDB, and is compatible with all major browsers. Source codes can be downloaded from https://github.com/fchalmel/RGV.

34643729	2022	Nucleic acids research	scAPAatlas: an atlas of alternative polyadenylation across cell types in human and mouse.	Alternative polyadenylation (APA) has been widely recognized as a crucial step during the post-transcriptional regulation of eukaryotic genes. Recent studies have demonstrated that APA exerts key regulatory roles in many biological processes and often occurs in a tissue- and cell-type-specific manner. However, to our knowledge, there is no database incorporating information about APA at the cell-type level. Single-cell RNA-seq is a rapidly evolving and powerful tool that enable APA analysis at the cell-type level. Here, we present a comprehensive resource, scAPAatlas (http://www.bioailab.com:3838/scAPAatlas), for exploring APA across different cell types, and interpreting potential biological functions. Based on the curated scRNA-seq data from 24 human and 25 mouse normal tissues, we systematically identified cell-type-specific APA events for different cell types and examined the correlations between APA and gene expression level. We also estimated the crosstalk between cell-type-specific APA events and microRNAs or RNA-binding proteins. A user-friendly web interface has been constructed to support browsing, searching and visualizing multi-layer information of cell-type-specific APA events. Overall, scAPAatlas, incorporating a rich resource for exploration of APA at the cell-type level, will greatly help researchers chart cell type with APA and elucidate the biological functions of APA.
31932729	2020	Nature biotechnology	Titrating gene expression using libraries of systematically attenuated CRISPR guide RNAs.	A lack of tools to precisely control gene expression has limited our ability to evaluate relationships between expression levels and phenotypes. Here, we describe an approach to titrate expression of human genes using CRISPR interference and series of single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) with systematically modulated activities. We used large-scale measurements across multiple cell models to characterize activities of sgRNAs containing mismatches to their target sites and derived rules governing mismatched sgRNA activity using deep learning. These rules enabled us to synthesize a compact sgRNA library to titrate expression of ~2,400 genes essential for robust cell growth and to construct an in silico sgRNA library spanning the human genome. Staging cells along a continuum of gene expression levels combined with single-cell RNA-seq readout revealed sharp transitions in cellular behaviors at gene-specific expression thresholds. Our work provides a general tool to control gene expression, with applications ranging from tuning biochemical pathways to identifying suppressors for diseases of dysregulated gene expression.
30097058	2018	Genome biology	Single-cell RNAseq for the study of isoforms-how is that possible?	Single-cell RNAseq and alternative splicing studies have recently become two of the most prominent applications of RNAseq. However, the combination of both is still challenging, and few research efforts have been dedicated to the intersection between them. Cell-level insight on isoform expression is required to fully understand the biology of alternative splicing, but it is still an open question to what extent isoform expression analysis at the single-cell level is actually feasible. Here, we establish a set of four conditions that are required for a successful single-cell-level isoform study and evaluate how these conditions are met by these technologies in published research.
26387834	2015	Genome biology	Single-cell transcriptomic reconstruction reveals cell cycle and multi-lineage differentiation defects in Bcl11a-deficient hematopoietic stem cells.	BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are a rare cell type with the ability of long-term self-renewal and multipotency to reconstitute all blood lineages. HSCs are typically purified from the bone marrow using cell surface markers. Recent studies have identified significant cellular heterogeneities in the HSC compartment with subsets of HSCs displaying lineage bias. We previously discovered that the transcription factor Bcl11a has critical functions in the lymphoid development of the HSC compartment. RESULTS: In this report, we employ single-cell transcriptomic analysis to dissect the molecular heterogeneities in HSCs. We profile the transcriptomes of 180 highly purified HSCs (Bcl11a (+/+) and Bcl11a (-/-)). Detailed analysis of the RNA-seq data identifies cell cycle activity as the major source of transcriptomic variation in the HSC compartment, which allows reconstruction of HSC cell cycle progression in silico. Single-cell RNA-seq profiling of Bcl11a (-/-) HSCs reveals abnormal proliferative phenotypes. Analysis of lineage gene expression suggests that the Bcl11a (-/-) HSCs are constituted of two distinct myeloerythroid-restricted subpopulations. Remarkably, similar myeloid-restricted cells could also be detected in the wild-type HSC compartment, suggesting selective elimination of lymphoid-competent HSCs after Bcl11a deletion. These defects are experimentally validated in serial transplantation experiments where Bcl11a (-/-) HSCs are myeloerythroid-restricted and defective in self-renewal. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the power of single-cell transcriptomics in dissecting cellular process and lineage heterogeneities in stem cell compartments, and further reveals the molecular and cellular defects in the Bcl11a-deficient HSC compartment.
35610053	2022	Nucleic acids research	WebCSEA: web-based cell-type-specific enrichment analysis of genes.	Human complex traits and common diseases show tissue- and cell-type- specificity. Recently, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has successfully depicted cellular heterogeneity in human tissue, providing an unprecedented opportunity to understand the context-specific expression of complex trait-associated genes in human tissue-cell types (TCs). Here, we present the first web-based application to quickly assess the cell-type-specificity of genes, named Web-based Cell-type Specific Enrichment Analysis of Genes (WebCSEA, available at https://bioinfo.uth.edu/webcsea/). Specifically, we curated a total of 111 scRNA-seq panels of human tissues and 1,355 TCs from 61 different general tissues across 11 human organ systems. We adapted our previous decoding tissue-specificity (deTS) algorithm to measure the enrichment for each tissue-cell type (TC). To overcome the potential bias from the number of signature genes between different TCs, we further developed a permutation-based method that accurately estimates the TC-specificity of a given inquiry gene list. WebCSEA also provides an interactive heatmap that displays the cell-type specificity across 1355 human TCs, and other interactive and static visualizations of cell-type specificity by human organ system, developmental stage, and top-ranked tissues and cell types. In short, WebCSEA is a one-click application that provides a comprehensive exploration of the TC-specificity of genes among human major TC map.
34634794	2022	Nucleic acids research	CeDR Atlas: a knowledgebase of cellular drug response.	Drug response to many diseases varies dramatically due to the complex genomics and functional features and contexts. Cellular diversity of human tissues, especially tumors, is one of the major contributing factors to the different drug response in different samples. With the accumulation of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, it is now possible to study the drug response to different treatments at the single cell resolution. Here, we present CeDR Atlas (available at https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/cedr), a knowledgebase reporting computational inference of cellular drug response for hundreds of cell types from various tissues. We took advantage of the high-throughput profiling of drug-induced gene expression available through the Connectivity Map resource (CMap) as well as hundreds of scRNA-seq data covering cells from a wide variety of organs/tissues, diseases, and conditions. Currently, CeDR maintains the results for more than 582 single cell data objects for human, mouse and cell lines, including about 140 phenotypes and 1250 tissue-cell combination types. All the results can be explored and searched by keywords for drugs, cell types, tissues, diseases, and signature genes. Overall, CeDR fine maps drug response at cellular resolution and sheds lights on the design of combinatorial treatments, drug resistance and even drug side effects.
41052280	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Network based simultaneous embedding of cells and marker genes from scRNA-seq studies.	The complexity of scRNA-sequencing datasets highlights the urgent need for enhanced clustering and visualization methods. Here, we propose Stardust, an iterative, force-directed graph layout algorithm that enables the simultaneous embedding of cells and marker genes. Stardust, for the first time, allows a single-stop visualization of cells and marker genes on a single 2D map. While Stardust provides its own visualization pipeline, it can be plugged in with state-of-the-art methods such as Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE). We benchmarked Stardust against popular visualization and clustering tools on both scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics datasets. In all cases, Stardust performs competitively in identifying and visualizing cell types in an accurate and spatially coherent manner.
34424948	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	DeepDRIM: a deep neural network to reconstruct cell-type-specific gene regulatory network using single-cell RNA-seq data.	Single-cell RNA sequencing has enabled to capture the gene activities at single-cell resolution, thus allowing reconstruction of cell-type-specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs). The available algorithms for reconstructing GRNs are commonly designed for bulk RNA-seq data, and few of them are applicable to analyze scRNA-seq data by dealing with the dropout events and cellular heterogeneity. In this paper, we represent the joint gene expression distribution of a gene pair as an image and propose a novel supervised deep neural network called DeepDRIM which utilizes the image of the target TF-gene pair and the ones of the potential neighbors to reconstruct GRN from scRNA-seq data. Due to the consideration of TF-gene pair's neighborhood context, DeepDRIM can effectively eliminate the false positives caused by transitive gene-gene interactions. We compared DeepDRIM with nine GRN reconstruction algorithms designed for either bulk or single-cell RNA-seq data. It achieves evidently better performance for the scRNA-seq data collected from eight cell lines. The simulated data show that DeepDRIM is robust to the dropout rate, the cell number and the size of the training data. We further applied DeepDRIM to the scRNA-seq gene expression of B cells from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of the patients with mild and severe coronavirus disease 2019. We focused on the cell-type-specific GRN alteration and observed targets of TFs that were differentially expressed between the two statuses to be enriched in lysosome, apoptosis, response to decreased oxygen level and microtubule, which had been proved to be associated with coronavirus infection.
36847692	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	IBRAP: integrated benchmarking single-cell RNA-sequencing analytical pipeline.	Single-cell ribonucleic acid (RNA)-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool to study cellular heterogeneity. The high dimensional data generated from this technology are complex and require specialized expertise for analysis and interpretation. The core of scRNA-seq data analysis contains several key analytical steps, which include pre-processing, quality control, normalization, dimensionality reduction, integration and clustering. Each step often has many algorithms developed with varied underlying assumptions and implications. With such a diverse choice of tools available, benchmarking analyses have compared their performances and demonstrated that tools operate differentially according to the data types and complexity. Here, we present Integrated Benchmarking scRNA-seq Analytical Pipeline (IBRAP), which contains a suite of analytical components that can be interchanged throughout the pipeline alongside multiple benchmarking metrics that enable users to compare results and determine the optimal pipeline combinations for their data. We apply IBRAP to single- and multi-sample integration analysis using primary pancreatic tissue, cancer cell line and simulated data accompanied with ground truth cell labels, demonstrating the interchangeable and benchmarking functionality of IBRAP. Our results confirm that the optimal pipelines are dependent on individual samples and studies, further supporting the rationale and necessity of our tool. We then compare reference-based cell annotation with unsupervised analysis, both included in IBRAP, and demonstrate the superiority of the reference-based method in identifying robust major and minor cell types. Thus, IBRAP presents a valuable tool to integrate multiple samples and studies to create reference maps of normal and diseased tissues, facilitating novel biological discovery using the vast volume of scRNA-seq data available.

27150006	2016	Genome biology	In silico lineage tracing through single cell transcriptomics identifies a neural stem cell population in planarians.	BACKGROUND: The planarian Schmidtea mediterranea is a master regenerator with a large adult stem cell compartment. The lack of transgenic labeling techniques in this animal has hindered the study of lineage progression and has made understanding the mechanisms of tissue regeneration a challenge. However, recent advances in single-cell transcriptomics and analysis methods allow for the discovery of novel cell lineages as differentiation progresses from stem cell to terminally differentiated cell. RESULTS: Here we apply pseudotime analysis and single-cell transcriptomics to identify adult stem cells belonging to specific cellular lineages and identify novel candidate genes for future in vivo lineage studies. We purify 168 single stem and progeny cells from the planarian head, which were subjected to single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). Pseudotime analysis with Waterfall and gene set enrichment analysis predicts a molecularly distinct neoblast sub-population with neural character (nuNeoblasts) as well as a novel alternative lineage. Using the predicted nuNeoblast markers, we demonstrate that a novel proliferative stem cell population exists adjacent to the brain. CONCLUSIONS: scRNAseq coupled with in silico lineage analysis offers a new approach for studying lineage progression in planarians. The lineages identified here are extracted from a highly heterogeneous dataset with minimal prior knowledge of planarian lineages, demonstrating that lineage purification by transgenic labeling is not a prerequisite for this approach. The identification of the nuNeoblast lineage demonstrates the usefulness of the planarian system for computationally predicting cellular lineages in an adult context coupled with in vivo verification.
33830183	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	MicroCellClust: mining rare and highly specific subpopulations from single-cell expression data.	MOTIVATION: Identifying rare subpopulations of cells is a critical step in order to extract knowledge from single-cell expression data, especially when the available data is limited and rare subpopulations only contain a few cells. In this paper, we present a data mining method to identify small subpopulations of cells that present highly specific expression profiles. This objective is formalized as a constrained optimization problem that jointly identifies a small group of cells and a corresponding subset of specific genes. The proposed method extends the max-sum submatrix problem to yield genes that are, for instance, highly expressed inside a small number of cells, but have a low expression in the remaining ones. RESULTS: We show through controlled experiments on scRNA-seq data that the MicroCellClust method achieves a high F1 score to identify rare subpopulations of artificially planted human T cells. The effectiveness of MicroCellClust is confirmed as it reveals a subpopulation of CD4 T cells with a specific phenotype from breast cancer samples, and a subpopulation linked to a specific stage in the cell cycle from breast cancer samples as well. Finally, three rare subpopulations in mouse embryonic stem cells are also identified with MicroCellClust. These results illustrate the proposed method outperforms typical alternatives at identifying small subsets of cells with highly specific expression profiles. AVAILABILITYAND IMPLEMENTATION: The R and Scala implementation of MicroCellClust is freely available on GitHub, at https://github.com/agerniers/MicroCellClust/ The data underlying this article are available on Zenodo, at https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4580332.

35639509	2022	Nucleic acids research	Disentangling single-cell omics representation with a power spectral density-based feature extraction.	Emerging single-cell technologies provide high-resolution measurements of distinct cellular modalities opening new avenues for generating detailed cellular atlases of many and diverse tissues. The high dimensionality, sparsity, and inaccuracy of single cell sequencing measurements, however, can obscure discriminatory information, mask cellular subtype variations and complicate downstream analyses which can limit our understanding of cell function and tissue heterogeneity. Here, we present a novel pre-processing method (scPSD) inspired by power spectral density analysis that enhances the accuracy for cell subtype separation from large-scale single-cell omics data. We comprehensively benchmarked our method on a wide range of single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets and showed that scPSD pre-processing, while being fast and scalable, significantly reduces data complexity, enhances cell-type separation, and enables rare cell identification. Additionally, we applied scPSD to transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility cell atlases and demonstrated its capacity to discriminate over 100 cell types across the whole organism and across different modalities of single-cell omics data.
25406327	2015	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	WemIQ: an accurate and robust isoform quantification method for RNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: The deconvolution of isoform expression from RNA-seq remains challenging because of non-uniform read sampling and subtle differences among isoforms. RESULTS: We present a weighted-log-likelihood expectation maximization method on isoform quantification (WemIQ). WemIQ integrates an effective bias removal with a weighted expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to distribute reads among isoforms efficiently. The weight represents the oversampling or undersampling of sequence reads and is estimated through a generalized Poisson model without any presumption on the bias sources and formats. WemIQ significantly improves the quantification of isoform and gene expression as well as the derived exon inclusion rates. It provides robust expression estimates across different laboratories and protocols, which is valuable for the integrative analysis of RNA-seq. For the recent single-cell RNA-seq data, WemIQ also provides the opportunity to distinguish bias heterogeneity from true biological heterogeneity and uncovers smaller cell-to-cell expression variability.
32820322	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	LncAS2Cancer: a comprehensive database for alternative splicing of lncRNAs across human cancers.	Accumulating studies demonstrated that the roles of lncRNAs for tumorigenesis were isoform-dependent and their aberrant splicing patterns in cancers contributed to function specificity. However, there is no existing database focusing on cancer-related alternative splicing of lncRNAs. Here, we developed a comprehensive database called LncAS2Cancer, which collected 5335 bulk RNA sequencing and 1826 single-cell RNA sequencing samples, covering over 30 cancer types. By applying six state-of-the-art splicing algorithms, 50 859 alternative splicing events for 8 splicing types were identified and deposited in the database. In addition, the database contained the following information: (i) splicing patterns of lncRNAs under seven different conditions, such as gene interference, which facilitated to infer potential regulators; (ii) annotation information derived from eight sources and manual curation, to understand the functional impact of affected sequences; (iii) survival analysis to explore potential biomarkers; as well as (iv) a suite of tools to browse, search, visualize and download interesting information. LncAS2Cancer could not only confirm the known cancer-associated lncRNA isoforms but also indicate novel ones. Using the data deposited in LncAS2Cancer, we compared gene model and transcript overlap between lncRNAs and protein-coding genes and discusses how these factors, along with sequencing depth, affected the interpretation of splicing signals. Based on recurrent signals and potential confounders, we proposed a reliable score to prioritize splicing events for further elucidation. Together, with the broad collection of lncRNA splicing patterns and annotation, LncAS2Cancer will provide important new insights into the diverse functional roles of lncRNA isoforms in human cancers. LncAS2Cancer is freely available at https://lncrna2as.cd120.com/.
32968798	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	Unveiling COVID-19-associated organ-specific cell types and cell-specific pathway cascade.	The novel coronavirus or COVID-19 has first been found in Wuhan, China, and became pandemic. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) plays a key role in the host cells as a receptor of Spike-I Glycoprotein of COVID-19 which causes final infection. ACE2 is highly expressed in the bladder, ileum, kidney and liver, comparing with ACE2 expression in the lung-specific pulmonary alveolar type II cells. In this study, the single-cell RNAseq data of the five tissues from different humans are curated and cell types with high expressions of ACE2 are identified. Subsequently, the protein-protein interaction networks have been established. From the network, potential biomarkers which can form functional hubs, are selected based on k-means network clustering. It is observed that angiotensin PPAR family proteins show important roles in the functional hubs. To understand the functions of the potential markers, corresponding pathways have been researched thoroughly through the pathway semantic networks. Subsequently, the pathways have been ranked according to their influence and dependency in the network using PageRank algorithm. The outcomes show some important facts in terms of infection. Firstly, renin-angiotensin system and PPAR signaling pathway can play a vital role for enhancing the infection after its intrusion through ACE2. Next, pathway networks consist of few basic metabolic and influential pathways, e.g. insulin resistance. This information corroborate the fact that diabetic patients are more vulnerable to COVID-19 infection. Interestingly, the key regulators of the aforementioned pathways are angiontensin and PPAR family proteins. Hence, angiotensin and PPAR family proteins can be considered as possible therapeutic targets.

36627114	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Structure-preserved dimension reduction using joint triplets sampling for multi-batch integration of single-cell transcriptomic data.	Dimension reduction (DR) plays an important role in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), such as data interpretation, visualization and other downstream analysis. A desired DR method should be applicable to various application scenarios, including identifying cell types, preserving the inherent structure of data and handling with batch effects. However, most of the existing DR methods fail to accommodate these requirements simultaneously, especially removing batch effects. In this paper, we develop a novel structure-preserved dimension reduction (SPDR) method using intra- and inter-batch triplets sampling. The constructed triplets jointly consider each anchor's mutual nearest neighbors from inter-batch, k-nearest neighbors from intra-batch and randomly selected cells from the whole data, which capture higher order structure information and meanwhile account for batch information of the data. Then we minimize a robust loss function for the chosen triplets to obtain a structure-preserved and batch-corrected low-dimensional representation. Comprehensive evaluations show that SPDR outperforms other competing DR methods, such as INSCT, IVIS, Trimap, Scanorama, scVI and UMAP, in removing batch effects, preserving biological variation, facilitating visualization and improving clustering accuracy. Besides, the two-dimensional (2D) embedding of SPDR presents a clear and authentic expression pattern, and can guide researchers to determine how many cell types should be identified. Furthermore, SPDR is robust to complex data characteristics (such as down-sampling, duplicates and outliers) and varying hyperparameter settings. We believe that SPDR will be a valuable tool for characterizing complex cellular heterogeneity.
39992219	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	COME: contrastive mapping learning for spatial reconstruction of single-cell RNA sequencing data.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables high-throughput transcriptomic profiling at single-cell resolution. The inherent spatial location is crucial for understanding how single cells orchestrate multicellular functions and drive diseases. However, spatial information is often lost during tissue dissociation. Spatial transcriptomic (ST) technologies can provide precise spatial gene expression atlas, while their practicality is constrained by the number of genes they can assay or the associated costs at a larger scale and the fine-grained cell-type annotation. By transferring knowledge between scRNA-seq and ST data through cell correspondence learning, it is possible to recover the spatial properties inherent in scRNA-seq datasets. RESULTS: In this study, we introduce COME, a COntrastive Mapping lEarning approach that learns mapping between ST and scRNA-seq data to recover the spatial information of scRNA-seq data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed COME method effectively captures precise cell-spot relationships and outperforms previous methods in recovering spatial location for scRNA-seq data. More importantly, our method is capable of precisely identifying biologically meaningful information within the data, such as the spatial structure of missing genes, spatial hierarchical patterns, and the cell-type compositions for each spot. These results indicate that the proposed COME method can help to understand the heterogeneity and activities among cells within tissue environments. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The COME is freely available in GitHub (https://github.com/cindyway/COME).
34850092	2022	Nucleic acids research	Integration of single cell data by disentangled representation learning.	Recent developments of single cell RNA-sequencing technologies lead to the exponential growth of single cell sequencing datasets across different conditions. Combining these datasets helps to better understand cellular identity and function. However, it is challenging to integrate different datasets from different laboratories or technologies due to batch effect, which are interspersed with biological variances. To overcome this problem, we have proposed Single Cell Integration by Disentangled Representation Learning (SCIDRL), a domain adaption-based method, to learn low-dimensional representations invariant to batch effect. This method can efficiently remove batch effect while retaining cell type purity. We applied it to thirteen diverse simulated and real datasets. Benchmark results show that SCIDRL outperforms other methods in most cases and exhibits excellent performances in two common situations: (i) effective integration of batch-shared rare cell types and preservation of batch-specific rare cell types; (ii) reliable integration of datasets with different cell compositions. This demonstrates SCIDRL will offer a valuable tool for researchers to decode the enigma of cell heterogeneity.
36941114	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	SoCube: an innovative end-to-end doublet detection algorithm for analyzing scRNA-seq data.	Doublets formed during single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) severely affect downstream studies, such as differentially expressed gene analysis and cell trajectory inference, and limit the cellular throughput of scRNA-seq. Several doublet detection algorithms are currently available, but their generalization performance could be further improved due to the lack of effective feature-embedding strategies with suitable model architectures. Therefore, SoCube, a novel deep learning algorithm, was developed to precisely detect doublets in various types of scRNA-seq data. SoCube (i) proposed a novel 3D composite feature-embedding strategy that embedded latent gene information and (ii) constructed a multikernel, multichannel CNN-ensembled architecture in conjunction with the feature-embedding strategy. With its excellent performance on benchmark evaluation and several downstream tasks, it is expected to be a powerful algorithm to detect and remove doublets in scRNA-seq data. SoCube is freely provided as an end-to-end tool on the Python official package site PyPi (https://pypi.org/project/socube/) and open-source on GitHub (https://github.com/idrblab/socube/).
38662553	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	CASCC: a co-expression-assisted single-cell RNA-seq data clustering method.	SUMMARY: Existing clustering methods for characterizing cell populations from single-cell RNA sequencing are constrained by several limitations stemming from the fact that clusters often cannot be homogeneous, particularly for transitioning populations. On the other hand, dominant cell populations within samples can be identified independently by their strong gene co-expression signatures using methods unrelated to partitioning. Here, we introduce a clustering method, CASCC (co-expression-assisted single-cell clustering), designed to improve biological accuracy using gene co-expression features identified using an unsupervised adaptive attractor algorithm. CASCC outperformed other methods as evidenced by multiple evaluation metrics, and our results suggest that CASCC can improve the analysis of single-cell transcriptomics, enabling potential new discoveries related to underlying biological mechanisms. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The CASCC R package is publicly available at https://github.com/LingyiC/CASCC and https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10648327.
31829268	2019	Genome biology	scPred: accurate supervised method for cell-type classification from single-cell RNA-seq data.	Single-cell RNA sequencing has enabled the characterization of highly specific cell types in many tissues, as well as both primary and stem cell-derived cell lines. An important facet of these studies is the ability to identify the transcriptional signatures that define a cell type or state. In theory, this information can be used to classify an individual cell based on its transcriptional profile. Here, we present scPred, a new generalizable method that is able to provide highly accurate classification of single cells, using a combination of unbiased feature selection from a reduced-dimension space, and machine-learning probability-based prediction method. We apply scPred to scRNA-seq data from pancreatic tissue, mononuclear cells, colorectal tumor biopsies, and circulating dendritic cells and show that scPred is able to classify individual cells with high accuracy. The generalized method is available at https://github.com/powellgenomicslab/scPred/.
32990747	2020	Nucleic acids research	Hybridization-based in situ sequencing (HybISS) for spatially resolved transcriptomics in human and mouse brain tissue.	Visualization of the transcriptome in situ has proven to be a valuable tool in exploring single-cell RNA-sequencing data, providing an additional spatial dimension to investigate multiplexed gene expression, cell types, disease architecture or even data driven discoveries. In situ sequencing (ISS) method based on padlock probes and rolling circle amplification has been used to spatially resolve gene transcripts in tissue sections of various origins. Here, we describe the next iteration of ISS, HybISS, hybridization-based in situ sequencing. Modifications in probe design allows for a new barcoding system via sequence-by-hybridization chemistry for improved spatial detection of RNA transcripts. Due to the amplification of probes, amplicons can be visualized with standard epifluorescence microscopes for high-throughput efficiency and the new sequencing chemistry removes limitations bound by sequence-by-ligation chemistry of ISS. HybISS design allows for increased flexibility and multiplexing, increased signal-to-noise, all without compromising throughput efficiency of imaging large fields of view. Moreover, the current protocol is demonstrated to work on human brain tissue samples, a source that has proven to be difficult to work with image-based spatial analysis techniques. Overall, HybISS technology works as a targeted amplification detection method for improved spatial transcriptomic visualization, and importantly, with an ease of implementation.
39653820	2025	Nature methods	Multiplexing cortical brain organoids for the longitudinal dissection of developmental traits at single-cell resolution.	Dissecting human neurobiology at high resolution and with mechanistic precision requires a major leap in scalability, given the need for experimental designs that include multiple individuals and, prospectively, population cohorts. To lay the foundation for this, we have developed and benchmarked complementary strategies to multiplex brain organoids by pooling cells from different pluripotent stem cell (PSC) lines either during organoid generation (mosaic models) or before single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) library preparation (downstream multiplexing). We have also developed a new computational method, SCanSNP, and a consensus call to deconvolve cell identities, overcoming current criticalities in doublets and low-quality cell identification. We validated both multiplexing methods for charting neurodevelopmental trajectories at high resolution, thus linking specific individuals' trajectories to genetic variation. Finally, we modeled their scalability across different multiplexing combinations and showed that mosaic organoids represent an enabling method for high-throughput settings. Together, this multiplexing suite of experimental and computational methods provides a highly scalable resource for brain disease and neurodiversity modeling.
36253801	2022	Genome biology	scGWAS: landscape of trait-cell type associations by integrating single-cell transcriptomics-wide and genome-wide association studies.	BACKGROUND: The rapid accumulation of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data presents unique opportunities to decode the genetically mediated cell-type specificity in complex diseases. Here, we develop a new method, scGWAS, which effectively leverages scRNA-seq data to achieve two goals: (1) to infer the cell types in which the disease-associated genes manifest and (2) to construct cellular modules which imply disease-specific activation of different processes. RESULTS: scGWAS only utilizes the average gene expression for each cell type followed by virtual search processes to construct the null distributions of module scores, making it scalable to large scRNA-seq datasets. We demonstrated scGWAS in 40 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) datasets (average sample size N  approximately  154,000) using 18 scRNA-seq datasets from nine major human/mouse tissues (totaling 1.08 million cells) and identified 2533 trait and cell-type associations, each with significant modules for further investigation. The module genes were validated using disease or clinically annotated references from ClinVar, OMIM, and pLI variants. CONCLUSIONS: We showed that the trait-cell type associations identified by scGWAS, while generally constrained to trait-tissue associations, could recapitulate many well-studied relationships and also reveal novel relationships, providing insights into the unsolved trait-tissue associations. Moreover, in each specific cell type, the associations with different traits were often mediated by different sets of risk genes, implying disease-specific activation of driving processes. In summary, scGWAS is a powerful tool for exploring the genetic basis of complex diseases at the cell type level using single-cell expression data.
38741206	2024	Genome biology	EmptyDropsMultiome discriminates real cells from background in single-cell multiomics assays.	Multiomic droplet-based technologies allow different molecular modalities, such as chromatin accessibility and gene expression (scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq), to be probed in the same nucleus. We develop EmptyDropsMultiome, an approach that distinguishes true nuclei-containing droplets from background. Using simulations, we show that EmptyDropsMultiome has higher statistical power and accuracy than existing approaches, including CellRanger-arc and EmptyDrops. On real datasets, we observe that CellRanger-arc misses more than half of the nuclei identified by EmptyDropsMultiome and, moreover, is biased against certain cell types, some of which have a retrieval rate lower than 20%.
37387141	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Cell type matching across species using protein embeddings and transfer learning.	MOTIVATION: Knowing the relation between cell types is crucial for translating experimental results from mice to humans. Establishing cell type matches, however, is hindered by the biological differences between the species. A substantial amount of evolutionary information between genes that could be used to align the species is discarded by most of the current methods since they only use one-to-one orthologous genes. Some methods try to retain the information by explicitly including the relation between genes, however, not without caveats. RESULTS: In this work, we present a model to transfer and align cell types in cross-species analysis (TACTiCS). First, TACTiCS uses a natural language processing model to match genes using their protein sequences. Next, TACTiCS employs a neural network to classify cell types within a species. Afterward, TACTiCS uses transfer learning to propagate cell type labels between species. We applied TACTiCS on scRNA-seq data of the primary motor cortex of human, mouse, and marmoset. Our model can accurately match and align cell types on these datasets. Moreover, our model outperforms Seurat and the state-of-the-art method SAMap. Finally, we show that our gene matching method results in better cell type matches than BLAST in our model. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The implementation is available on GitHub (https://github.com/kbiharie/TACTiCS). The preprocessed datasets and trained models can be downloaded from Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7582460).
33839756	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	iSMNN: batch effect correction for single-cell RNA-seq data via iterative supervised mutual nearest neighbor refinement.	Batch effect correction is an essential step in the integrative analysis of multiple single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. One state-of-the-art strategy for batch effect correction is via unsupervised or supervised detection of mutual nearest neighbors (MNNs). However, both types of methods only detect MNNs across batches of uncorrected data, where the large batch effects may affect the MNN search. To address this issue, we presented a batch effect correction approach via iterative supervised MNN (iSMNN) refinement across data after correction. Our benchmarking on both simulation and real datasets showed the advantages of the iterative refinement of MNNs on the performance of correction. Compared to popular alternative methods, our iSMNN is able to better mix the cells of the same cell type across batches. In addition, iSMNN can also facilitate the identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that are relevant to the biological function of certain cell types. These results indicated that iSMNN will be a valuable method for integrating multiple scRNA-seq datasets that can facilitate biological and medical studies at single-cell level.
34083791	2021	Nature biotechnology	Spatial transcriptomics at subspot resolution with BayesSpace.	Recent spatial gene expression technologies enable comprehensive measurement of transcriptomic profiles while retaining spatial context. However, existing analysis methods do not address the limited resolution of the technology or use the spatial information efficiently. Here, we introduce BayesSpace, a fully Bayesian statistical method that uses the information from spatial neighborhoods for resolution enhancement of spatial transcriptomic data and for clustering analysis. We benchmark BayesSpace against current methods for spatial and non-spatial clustering and show that it improves identification of distinct intra-tissue transcriptional profiles from samples of the brain, melanoma, invasive ductal carcinoma and ovarian adenocarcinoma. Using immunohistochemistry and an in silico dataset constructed from scRNA-seq data, we show that BayesSpace resolves tissue structure that is not detectable at the original resolution and identifies transcriptional heterogeneity inaccessible to histological analysis. Our results illustrate BayesSpace's utility in facilitating the discovery of biological insights from spatial transcriptomic datasets.
40210438	2025	Genome research	TFcomb identifies transcription factor combinations for cellular reprogramming based on single-cell multiomics data.	Reprogramming cell state transitions provides the potential for cell engineering and regenerative therapy. Finding the reprogramming transcription factors (TFs) and their combinations that can direct the desired state transition is crucial for the task. Computational methods have been developed to identify such reprogramming TFs. However, most of them can only generate a ranked list of individual TFs and ignore the identification of TF combinations. Even for individual reprogramming TF identification, current methods often fail to put the real effective reprogramming TFs at the top. To address these challenges, we developed TFcomb, a computational method that leverages single-cell multiomics data to identify reprogramming TFs and TF combinations. We modeled the task of finding reprogramming TFs and their combinations as an inverse problem, and used Tikhonov regularization to guarantee the generalization ability of solutions. For the coefficient matrix of the model, we designed a graph attention network to augment gene regulatory networks built with single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data. Benchmarking experiments on data of human embryonic stem cells demonstrate superior performance of TFcomb against existing methods for identifying individual TFs. We curate data sets of multiple cell reprogramming cases and demonstrate that TFcomb can efficiently identify reprogramming TF combinations from vast potential combinations. We apply TFcomb on a data set of mouse hair follicle development and find key TFs in cell differentiation. All experiments show that TFcomb is powerful in identifying reprogramming TFs and TF combinations from single-cell data sets to empower future cell engineering.
41261731	2025	Nucleic acids research	NONCODE v7.0: updated lncRNA resource integrating scRNA-seq data encompassing immune baseline, development, and disease.	The rapid advancement of single-cell multi-omics technologies, typified by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), has provided systematic methodologies for dissecting gene expression heterogeneity within cell populations. However, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) research is hindered by a lack of databases covering diverse tissues, disease contexts, and integrated multi-dimensional single-cell annotations. To address this gap, we updated NONCODE v7.0 (available at https://v7.noncode.org/) through the integration of scRNA-seq data, enabling systematic analysis of lncRNA expression. NONCODE v7.0 incorporates 2061 human scRNA-seq samples from 229 datasets, covering a spectrum of 6 categories, with 3 core ones including Physiological Control as an immune baseline, Physiological Development, and Pathological Disease. Following standardized quality control and processing, the database encompasses 14 million high-quality cells and annotates 94 843 lncRNAs (98.5% of human lncRNAs in NONCODE v6.0). Furthermore, we extended the database through the integration of single-cell-tailored functional modules, encompassing data query and retrieval, interactive visualization (including cell composition, UMAP/t-SNE clustering, marker gene heatmaps, and lncRNA expression profiles), and comparative analysis functionalities. The analytical module facilitates the identification of cell-type-specific differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs across distinct disease states, thus establishing a foundational resource platform to facilitate the advancement of downstream functional investigations into lncRNAs.
34213536	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Non-parametric modelling of temporal and spatial counts data from RNA-seq experiments.	MOTIVATION: The negative binomial distribution has been shown to be a good model for counts data from both bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). Gaussian process (GP) regression provides a useful non-parametric approach for modelling temporal or spatial changes in gene expression. However, currently available GP regression methods that implement negative binomial likelihood models do not scale to the increasingly large datasets being produced by single-cell and spatial transcriptomics. RESULTS: The GPcounts package implements GP regression methods for modelling counts data using a negative binomial likelihood function. Computational efficiency is achieved through the use of variational Bayesian inference. The GP function models changes in the mean of the negative binomial likelihood through a logarithmic link function and the dispersion parameter is fitted by maximum likelihood. We validate the method on simulated time course data, showing better performance to identify changes in over-dispersed counts data than methods based on Gaussian or Poisson likelihoods. To demonstrate temporal inference, we apply GPcounts to single-cell RNA-seq datasets after pseudotime and branching inference. To demonstrate spatial inference, we apply GPcounts to data from the mouse olfactory bulb to identify spatially variable genes and compare to two published GP methods. We also provide the option of modelling additional dropout using a zero-inflated negative binomial. Our results show that GPcounts can be used to model temporal and spatial counts data in cases where simpler Gaussian and Poisson likelihoods are unrealistic. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: GPcounts is implemented using the GPflow library in Python and is available at https://github.com/ManchesterBioinference/GPcounts along with the data, code and notebooks required to reproduce the results presented here. The version used for this paper is archived at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5027066. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
41159728	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Hi-C3: a statistical inference-based model for reconstructing higher-order cell-cell communication networks.	Multicellular organisms are composed of diverse cell types that must coordinate their behaviors through communication. Cell-cell communication (CCC) is essential for growth, development, differentiation, and immune response. Recent computational methods have leveraged single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to infer CCC via ligand-receptor interactions (LRIs), with most approaches focusing on pairwise interactions. However, many biological processes are driven by the coordinated action of multiple cell types, underscoring the need to model higher-order cellular interactions beyond pairwise interactions. Inspired by principles of network diffusion and epidemic dynamics, we first model the receptor expression as: a Poisson-distributed random variable biologically regulated by the collective signaling of multiple ligand-producing cell types. Then, we propose Hi-C3, a unified statistical inference-based framework for inferring both conventional pairwise and new higher-order CCC patterns from scRNA-seq data, which is solved via an efficient likelihood-based (EM) algorithm. Particularly, Hi-C3 employed a modified PageRank algorithm to assess the importance of individual cells or cell types within the higher-order network, revealing key cellular communication hubs supported by independent spatial and biological evidence. When applied to diverse datasets from Arabidopsis thaliana and colorectal cancer, Hi-C3 achieved comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods in the inferring pairwise communication while uniquely uncovering complex higher-order cellular communication structures. Collectively, Hi-C3 offers a powerful statistical model and computational framework for uncovering complex and coordinated multicellular signaling structures disregarded by pairwise communication inference methods, and offers novel biology network insights into the logic of cellular organization and communication in both development and disease.
38856169	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	CACIMAR: cross-species analysis of cell identities, markers, regulations, and interactions using single-cell RNA sequencing data.	Transcriptomic analysis across species is increasingly used to reveal conserved gene regulations which implicate crucial regulators. Cross-species analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data provides new opportunities to identify the cellular and molecular conservations, especially for cell types and cell type-specific gene regulations. However, few methods have been developed to analyze cross-species scRNA-seq data to uncover both molecular and cellular conservations. Here, we built a tool called CACIMAR, which can perform cross-species analysis of cell identities, markers, regulations, and interactions using scRNA-seq profiles. Based on the weighted sum models of the conserved features, we developed different conservation scores to measure the conservation of cell types, regulatory networks, and intercellular interactions. Using publicly available scRNA-seq data on retinal regeneration in mice, zebrafish, and chick, we demonstrated four main functions of CACIMAR. First, CACIMAR allows to identify conserved cell types even in evolutionarily distant species. Second, the tool facilitates the identification of evolutionarily conserved or species-specific marker genes. Third, CACIMAR enables the identification of conserved intracellular regulations, including cell type-specific regulatory subnetworks and regulators. Lastly, CACIMAR provides a unique feature for identifying conserved intercellular interactions. Overall, CACIMAR facilitates the identification of evolutionarily conserved cell types, marker genes, intracellular regulations, and intercellular interactions, providing insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of species evolution.
29843817	2018	Genome biology	BGP: identifying gene-specific branching dynamics from single-cell data with a branching Gaussian process.	High-throughput single-cell gene expression experiments can be used to uncover branching dynamics in cell populations undergoing differentiation through pseudotime methods. We develop the branching Gaussian process (BGP), a non-parametric model that is able to identify branching dynamics for individual genes and provide an estimate of branching times for each gene with an associated credible region. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on simulated data, a single-cell RNA-seq haematopoiesis study and mouse embryonic stem cells generated using droplet barcoding. The method is robust to high levels of technical variation and dropout, which are common in single-cell data.
34244789	2021	Nucleic acids research	Inferring single cell expression profiles from overlapped pooling sequencing data with compressed sensing strategy.	Though single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have been well developed, the acquisition of large-scale single cell expression data may still lead to high costs. Single cell expression profile has its inherent sparse properties, which makes it compressible, thus providing opportunities for solutions. Here, by computational simulation as well as experiment of 54 single cells, we propose that expression profiles can be compressed from the dimension of samples by overlapped assigning each cell into plenty of pools. And we prove that expression profiles can be inferred from these pool expression data with overlapped pooling design and compressed sensing strategy. We also show that by combining this approach with plate-based scRNA-seq measurement, it can maintain its superiorities in gene detection sensitivity and individual identity and recover the expression profile with high precision, while saving about half of the library cost. This method can inspire novel conceptions on the measurement, storage or computation improvements for other compressible signals in many biological areas.
36321662	2023	Nucleic acids research	TISCH2: expanded datasets and new tools for single-cell transcriptome analyses of the tumor microenvironment.	The Tumor Immune Single Cell Hub 2 (TISCH2) is a resource of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data from human and mouse tumors, which enables comprehensive characterization of gene expression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) across multiple cancer types. As an increasing number of datasets are generated in the public domain, in this update, TISCH2 has included 190 tumor scRNA-seq datasets covering 6 million cells in 50 cancer types, with 110 newly collected datasets and almost tripling the number of cells compared with the previous release. Furthermore, TISCH2 includes several new functions that allow users to better utilize the large-scale scRNA-seq datasets. First, in the Dataset module, TISCH2 provides the cell-cell communication results in each dataset, facilitating the analyses of interacted cell types and the discovery of significant ligand-receptor pairs between cell types. TISCH2 also includes the transcription factor analyses for each dataset and visualization of the top enriched transcription factors of each cell type. Second, in the Gene module, TISCH2 adds functions for identifying correlated genes and providing survival information for the input genes. In summary, TISCH2 is a user-friendly, up-to-date and well-maintained data resource for gene expression analyses in the TME. TISCH2 is freely available at http://tisch.comp-genomics.org/.
40973453	2025	Nucleic acids research	Absolute copy number aware CNV calling of sub-megabase segments in ultra-low coverage single-cell DNA sequencing data.	Recent advances in ultra-low coverage whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of single cells have enabled detailed analysis of copy number variation at a throughput approaching that of single-cell RNA sequencing. However, downstream computational methods have not seen comparable advances and are largely adaptations of deep sequencing methodology with reduced precision. Here, we present ASCENT, a computational method built to take full advantage of modern direct tagmentation-based WGS at ultra-low depth. Using joint segmentation with high-resolution bins, we accurately detect small segments, achieving accurate copy number profiles even at 100 000 reads per cell. ASCENT implements true absolute copy state inference for single cells, based on statistical modeling of coverage rather than comparison to a reference, while taking variable segment copy state into account. Further, ASCENT implements per-segment copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (LOH) calling without the need for non-tumor or bulk WGS reference. When applied to a pediatric B-ALL sample, ASCENT finds copy-neutral LOH in a small segment and a minor subclone defined by breakpoints missed in bulk WGS. Thus, by applying appropriate computational methods, single-cell WGS provides clear advantages over bulk, even at a relatively low cell number and sequencing depth.
40037709	2025	Nucleic acids research	Deep learning-based cell-specific gene regulatory networks inferred from single-cell multiome data.	Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) provide a global representation of how genetic/genomic information is transferred in living systems and are a key component in understanding genome regulation. Single-cell multiome data provide unprecedented opportunities to reconstruct GRNs at fine-grained resolution. However, the inference of GRNs is hindered by insufficient single omic profiles due to the characteristic high loss rate of single-cell sequencing data. In this study, we developed scMultiomeGRN, a deep learning framework to infer transcription factor (TF) regulatory networks via unique integration of single-cell genomic (single-cell RNA sequencing) and epigenomic (single-cell ATAC sequencing) data. We create scMultiomeGRN to elucidate these networks by conceptualizing TF network graph structures. Specifically, we build modality-specific neighbor aggregators and cross-modal attention modules to learn latent representations of TFs from single-cell multi-omics. We demonstrate that scMultiomeGRN outperforms state-of-the-art models on multiple benchmark datasets involved in diseases and health. Via scMultiomeGRN, we identified Alzheimer's disease-relevant regulatory network of SPI1 and RUNX1 for microglia. In summary, scMultiomeGRN offers a deep learning framework to identify cell type-specific gene regulatory network from single-cell multiome data.
29115968	2017	Genome biology	f-scLVM: scalable and versatile factor analysis for single-cell RNA-seq.	Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows studying heterogeneity in gene expression in large cell populations. Such heterogeneity can arise due to technical or biological factors, making decomposing sources of variation difficult. We here describe f-scLVM (factorial single-cell latent variable model), a method based on factor analysis that uses pathway annotations to guide the inference of interpretable factors underpinning the heterogeneity. Our model jointly estimates the relevance of individual factors, refines gene set annotations, and infers factors without annotation. In applications to multiple scRNA-seq datasets, we find that f-scLVM robustly decomposes scRNA-seq datasets into interpretable components, thereby facilitating the identification of novel subpopulations.
29457792	2018	Nature methods	On the design of CRISPR-based single-cell molecular screens.	Several groups recently coupled CRISPR perturbations and single-cell RNA-seq for pooled genetic screens. We demonstrate that vector designs of these studies are susceptible to  approximately 50% swapping of guide RNA-barcode associations because of lentiviral template switching. We optimized a published alternative, CROP-seq, in which the guide RNA also serves as the barcode, and here confirm that this strategy performs robustly and doubled the rate at which guides are assigned to cells to 94%.
24056876	2013	Nature methods	Accounting for technical noise in single-cell RNA-seq experiments.	Single-cell RNA-seq can yield valuable insights about the variability within a population of seemingly homogeneous cells. We developed a quantitative statistical method to distinguish true biological variability from the high levels of technical noise in single-cell experiments. Our approach quantifies the statistical significance of observed cell-to-cell variability in expression strength on a gene-by-gene basis. We validate our approach using two independent data sets from Arabidopsis thaliana and Mus musculus.
34987056	2022	Genome research	Zebrafish transposable elements show extensive diversification in age, genomic distribution, and developmental expression.	There is considerable interest in understanding the effect of transposable elements (TEs) on embryonic development. Studies in humans and mice are limited by the difficulty of working with mammalian embryos and by the relative scarcity of active TEs in these organisms. The zebrafish is an outstanding model for the study of vertebrate development, and over half of its genome consists of diverse TEs. However, zebrafish TEs remain poorly characterized. Here we describe the demography and genomic distribution of zebrafish TEs and their expression throughout embryogenesis using bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing data. These results reveal a highly dynamic genomic ecosystem comprising nearly 2000 distinct TE families, which vary in copy number by four orders of magnitude and span a wide range of ages. Longer retroelements tend to be retained in intergenic regions, whereas short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) and DNA transposons are more frequently found nearby or within genes. Locus-specific mapping of TE expression reveals extensive TE transcription during development. Although two-thirds of TE transcripts are likely driven by nearby gene promoters, we still observe stage- and tissue-specific expression patterns in self-regulated TEs. Long terminal repeat (LTR) retroelements are most transcriptionally active immediately following zygotic genome activation, whereas DNA transposons are enriched among transcripts expressed in later stages of development. Single-cell analysis reveals several endogenous retroviruses expressed in specific somatic cell lineages. Overall, our study provides a valuable resource for using zebrafish as a model to study the impact of TEs on vertebrate development.
40471991	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	ScInfeR: an efficient method for annotating cell types and sub-types in single-cell RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and spatial omics.	Cell-type annotation remains a major challenge in single-cell and spatial omics analysis. Most existing methods rely on single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) references or predefined marker sets. However, the scarcity of high-quality scRNA-seq references and marker sets makes relying on a single approach prone to bias and limits usability. Furthermore, available methods for cell-type annotation in single-cell ATAC-sequencing (scATAC-seq) and spatial transcriptomics datasets perform poorly. Here, we present ScInfeR, a graph-based cell-type annotation method that combines information from both scRNA-seq references and marker sets. By integrating these two data sources, ScInfeR can accurately annotate broad range of cell-types. It employs a hierarchical framework inspired by message-passing layers in graph neural networks to accurately identify cell subtypes. ScInfeR is highly versatile, supporting cell annotation across scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, and spatial omics datasets. For scATAC-seq, it effectively utilizes chromatin accessibility data, while for spatial transcriptomics, it incorporates spatial coordinate information. Additionally, ScInfeR supports weighted positive and negative markers, allowing users to define marker importance in cell-type classification. Our extensive benchmarking across multiple atlas-scale scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, and spatial datasets, evaluating 10 existing tools in over 100 cell-type prediction tasks, demonstrated ScInfeR's superior performance. Noteworthy, it exhibits robustness against batch effects arising in these datasets. To facilitate seamless annotation, we developed ScInfeRDB, an interactive database containing manually curated scRNA-seq references and marker sets for 329 cell-types, covering 2497 gene markers in 28 tissue types from human and plant. ScInfeR is available as an R package, with both the tool and database publicly accessible at https://www.swainasish.in/scinfer.
33974001	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scConnect: a method for exploratory analysis of cell-cell communication based on single-cell RNA-sequencing data.	MOTIVATION: Cell to cell communication is critical for all multicellular organisms, and single-cell sequencing facilitates the construction of full connectivity graphs between cell types in tissues. Such complex data structures demand novel analysis methods and tools for exploratory analysis. RESULTS: We propose a method to predict the putative ligand-receptor interactions between cell types from single-cell RNA-sequencing data. This is achieved by inferring and incorporating interactions in a multi-directional graph, thereby enabling contextual exploratory analysis. We demonstrate that our approach can detect common and specific interactions between cell types in mouse brain and human tumors, and that these interactions fit with expected outcomes. These interactions also include predictions made with molecular ligands integrating information from several types of genes necessary for ligand production and transport. Our implementation is general and can be appended to any transcriptome analysis pipeline to provide unbiased hypothesis generation regarding ligand to receptor interactions between cell populations or for network analysis in silico. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: scConnect is open source and available as a Python package at https://github.com/JonETJakobsson/scConnect. scConnect is directly compatible with Scanpy scRNA-sequencing pipelines. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
29540203	2018	Genome biology	Single-cell RNA-seq analysis unveils a prevalent epithelial/mesenchymal hybrid state during mouse organogenesis.	BACKGROUND: Organogenesis is crucial for proper organ formation during mammalian embryonic development. However, the similarities and shared features between different organs and the cellular heterogeneity during this process at single-cell resolution remain elusive. RESULTS: We perform single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of 1916 individual cells from eight organs and tissues of E9.5 to E11.5 mouse embryos, namely, the forebrain, hindbrain, skin, heart, somite, lung, liver, and intestine. Based on the regulatory activities rather than the expression patterns, all cells analyzed can be well classified into four major groups with epithelial, mesodermal, hematopoietic, and neuronal identities. For different organs within the same group, the similarities and differences of their features and developmental paths are revealed and reconstructed. CONCLUSIONS: We identify mutual interactions between epithelial and mesenchymal cells and detect epithelial cells with prevalent mesenchymal features during organogenesis, which are similar to the features of intermediate epithelial/mesenchymal cells during tumorigenesis. The comprehensive transcriptome at single-cell resolution profiled in our study paves the way for future mechanistic studies of the gene-regulatory networks governing mammalian organogenesis.
33837133	2021	Genome research	Bayesian estimation of cell type-specific gene expression with prior derived from single-cell data.	When assessed over a large number of samples, bulk RNA sequencing provides reliable data for gene expression at the tissue level. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) deepens those analyses by evaluating gene expression at the cellular level. Both data types lend insights into disease etiology. With current technologies, scRNA-seq data are known to be noisy. Constrained by costs, scRNA-seq data are typically generated from a relatively small number of subjects, which limits their utility for some analyses, such as identification of gene expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). To address these issues while maintaining the unique advantages of each data type, we develop a Bayesian method (bMIND) to integrate bulk and scRNA-seq data. With a prior derived from scRNA-seq data, we propose to estimate sample-level cell type-specific (CTS) expression from bulk expression data. The CTS expression enables large-scale sample-level downstream analyses, such as detection of CTS differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and eQTLs. Through simulations, we show that bMIND improves the accuracy of sample-level CTS expression estimates and increases the power to discover CTS DEGs when compared to existing methods. To further our understanding of two complex phenotypes, autism spectrum disorder and Alzheimer's disease, we apply bMIND to gene expression data of relevant brain tissue to identify CTS DEGs. Our results complement findings for CTS DEGs obtained from snRNA-seq studies, replicating certain DEGs in specific cell types while nominating other novel genes for those cell types. Finally, we calculate CTS eQTLs for 11 brain regions by analyzing Genotype-Tissue Expression Project data, creating a new resource for biological insights.
