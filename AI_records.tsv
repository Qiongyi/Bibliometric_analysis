24931975	2014	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Deep learning of the tissue-regulated splicing code.	MOTIVATION: Alternative splicing (AS) is a regulated process that directs the generation of different transcripts from single genes. A computational model that can accurately predict splicing patterns based on genomic features and cellular context is highly desirable, both in understanding this widespread phenomenon, and in exploring the effects of genetic variations on AS. METHODS: Using a deep neural network, we developed a model inferred from mouse RNA-Seq data that can predict splicing patterns in individual tissues and differences in splicing patterns across tissues. Our architecture uses hidden variables that jointly represent features in genomic sequences and tissue types when making predictions. A graphics processing unit was used to greatly reduce the training time of our models with millions of parameters. RESULTS: We show that the deep architecture surpasses the performance of the previous Bayesian method for predicting AS patterns. With the proper optimization procedure and selection of hyperparameters, we demonstrate that deep architectures can be beneficial, even with a moderately sparse dataset. An analysis of what the model has learned in terms of the genomic features is presented.	RNA-seq_records.filtered.tsv
26873929	2016	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Gene expression inference with deep learning.	MOTIVATION: Large-scale gene expression profiling has been widely used to characterize cellular states in response to various disease conditions, genetic perturbations, etc. Although the cost of whole-genome expression profiles has been dropping steadily, generating a compendium of expression profiling over thousands of samples is still very expensive. Recognizing that gene expressions are often highly correlated, researchers from the NIH LINCS program have developed a cost-effective strategy of profiling only  approximately 1000 carefully selected landmark genes and relying on computational methods to infer the expression of remaining target genes. However, the computational approach adopted by the LINCS program is currently based on linear regression (LR), limiting its accuracy since it does not capture complex nonlinear relationship between expressions of genes. RESULTS: We present a deep learning method (abbreviated as D-GEX) to infer the expression of target genes from the expression of landmark genes. We used the microarray-based Gene Expression Omnibus dataset, consisting of 111K expression profiles, to train our model and compare its performance to those from other methods. In terms of mean absolute error averaged across all genes, deep learning significantly outperforms LR with 15.33% relative improvement. A gene-wise comparative analysis shows that deep learning achieves lower error than LR in 99.97% of the target genes. We also tested the performance of our learned model on an independent RNA-Seq-based GTEx dataset, which consists of 2921 expression profiles. Deep learning still outperforms LR with 6.57% relative improvement, and achieves lower error in 81.31% of the target genes.

28882000	2017	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Integrative deep models for alternative splicing.	MOTIVATION: Advancements in sequencing technologies have highlighted the role of alternative splicing (AS) in increasing transcriptome complexity. This role of AS, combined with the relation of aberrant splicing to malignant states, motivated two streams of research, experimental and computational. The first involves a myriad of techniques such as RNA-Seq and CLIP-Seq to identify splicing regulators and their putative targets. The second involves probabilistic models, also known as splicing codes, which infer regulatory mechanisms and predict splicing outcome directly from genomic sequence. To date, these models have utilized only expression data. In this work, we address two related challenges: Can we improve on previous models for AS outcome prediction and can we integrate additional sources of data to improve predictions for AS regulatory factors. RESULTS: We perform a detailed comparison of two previous modeling approaches, Bayesian and Deep Neural networks, dissecting the confounding effects of datasets and target functions. We then develop a new target function for AS prediction in exon skipping events and show it significantly improves model accuracy. Next, we develop a modeling framework that leverages transfer learning to incorporate CLIP-Seq, knockdown and over expression experiments, which are inherently noisy and suffer from missing values. Using several datasets involving key splice factors in mouse brain, muscle and heart we demonstrate both the prediction improvements and biological insights offered by our new models. Overall, the framework we propose offers a scalable integrative solution to improve splicing code modeling as vast amounts of relevant genomic data become available.

28419223	2017	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Removal of batch effects using distribution-matching residual networks.	MOTIVATION: Sources of variability in experimentally derived data include measurement error in addition to the physical phenomena of interest. This measurement error is a combination of systematic components, originating from the measuring instrument and random measurement errors. Several novel biological technologies, such as mass cytometry and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), are plagued with systematic errors that may severely affect statistical analysis if the data are not properly calibrated. RESULTS: We propose a novel deep learning approach for removing systematic batch effects. Our method is based on a residual neural network, trained to minimize the Maximum Mean Discrepancy between the multivariate distributions of two replicates, measured in different batches. We apply our method to mass cytometry and scRNA-seq datasets, and demonstrate that it effectively attenuates batch effects.

29850911	2018	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	A graph-embedded deep feedforward network for disease outcome classification and feature selection using gene expression data.	MOTIVATION: Gene expression data represents a unique challenge in predictive model building, because of the small number of samples (n) compared with the huge amount of features (p). This 'n<<p' property has hampered application of deep learning techniques for disease outcome classification. Sparse learning by incorporating external gene network information could be a potential solution to this issue. Still, the problem is very challenging because (i) there are tens of thousands of features and only hundreds of training samples, (ii) the scale-free structure of the gene network is unfriendly to the setup of convolutional neural networks. RESULTS: To address these issues and build a robust classification model, we propose the Graph-Embedded Deep Feedforward Networks (GEDFN), to integrate external relational information of features into the deep neural network architecture. The method is able to achieve sparse connection between network layers to prevent overfitting. To validate the method's capability, we conducted both simulation experiments and real data analysis using a breast invasive carcinoma RNA-seq dataset and a kidney renal clear cell carcinoma RNA-seq dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The resulting high classification accuracy and easily interpretable feature selection results suggest the method is a useful addition to the current graph-guided classification models and feature selection procedures. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The method is available at https://github.com/yunchuankong/GEDFN. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

29949959	2018	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	COSSMO: predicting competitive alternative splice site selection using deep learning.	MOTIVATION: Alternative splice site selection is inherently competitive and the probability of a given splice site to be used also depends on the strength of neighboring sites. Here, we present a new model named the competitive splice site model (COSSMO), which explicitly accounts for these competitive effects and predicts the percent selected index (PSI) distribution over any number of putative splice sites. We model an alternative splicing event as the choice of a 3' acceptor site conditional on a fixed upstream 5' donor site or the choice of a 5' donor site conditional on a fixed 3' acceptor site. We build four different architectures that use convolutional layers, communication layers, long short-term memory and residual networks, respectively, to learn relevant motifs from sequence alone. We also construct a new dataset from genome annotations and RNA-Seq read data that we use to train our model. RESULTS: COSSMO is able to predict the most frequently used splice site with an accuracy of 70% on unseen test data, and achieve an R2 of 0.6 in modeling the PSI distribution. We visualize the motifs that COSSMO learns from sequence and show that COSSMO recognizes the consensus splice site sequences and many known splicing factors with high specificity. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Model predictions, our training dataset, and code are available from http://cossmo.genes.toronto.edu.

31510656	2019	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Deep learning with multimodal representation for pancancer prognosis prediction.	MOTIVATION: Estimating the future course of patients with cancer lesions is invaluable to physicians; however, current clinical methods fail to effectively use the vast amount of multimodal data that is available for cancer patients. To tackle this problem, we constructed a multimodal neural network-based model to predict the survival of patients for 20 different cancer types using clinical data, mRNA expression data, microRNA expression data and histopathology whole slide images (WSIs). We developed an unsupervised encoder to compress these four data modalities into a single feature vector for each patient, handling missing data through a resilient, multimodal dropout method. Encoding methods were tailored to each data type-using deep highway networks to extract features from clinical and genomic data, and convolutional neural networks to extract features from WSIs. RESULTS: We used pancancer data to train these feature encodings and predict single cancer and pancancer overall survival, achieving a C-index of 0.78 overall. This work shows that it is possible to build a pancancer model for prognosis that also predicts prognosis in single cancer sites. Furthermore, our model handles multiple data modalities, efficiently analyzes WSIs and represents patient multimodal data flexibly into an unsupervised, informative representation. We thus present a powerful automated tool to accurately determine prognosis, a key step towards personalized treatment for cancer patients.

31510700	2019	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	MOLI: multi-omics late integration with deep neural networks for drug response prediction.	MOTIVATION: Historically, gene expression has been shown to be the most informative data for drug response prediction. Recent evidence suggests that integrating additional omics can improve the prediction accuracy which raises the question of how to integrate the additional omics. Regardless of the integration strategy, clinical utility and translatability are crucial. Thus, we reasoned a multi-omics approach combined with clinical datasets would improve drug response prediction and clinical relevance. RESULTS: We propose MOLI, a multi-omics late integration method based on deep neural networks. MOLI takes somatic mutation, copy number aberration and gene expression data as input, and integrates them for drug response prediction. MOLI uses type-specific encoding sub-networks to learn features for each omics type, concatenates them into one representation and optimizes this representation via a combined cost function consisting of a triplet loss and a binary cross-entropy loss. The former makes the representations of responder samples more similar to each other and different from the non-responders, and the latter makes this representation predictive of the response values. We validate MOLI on in vitro and in vivo datasets for five chemotherapy agents and two targeted therapeutics. Compared to state-of-the-art single-omics and early integration multi-omics methods, MOLI achieves higher prediction accuracy in external validations. Moreover, a significant improvement in MOLI's performance is observed for targeted drugs when training on a pan-drug input, i.e. using all the drugs with the same target compared to training only on drug-specific inputs. MOLI's high predictive power suggests it may have utility in precision oncology. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: https://github.com/hosseinshn/MOLI.

31627739	2019	Genome biology	DeepImpute: an accurate, fast, and scalable deep neural network method to impute single-cell RNA-seq data.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers new opportunities to study gene expression of tens of thousands of single cells simultaneously. We present DeepImpute, a deep neural network-based imputation algorithm that uses dropout layers and loss functions to learn patterns in the data, allowing for accurate imputation. Overall, DeepImpute yields better accuracy than other six publicly available scRNA-seq imputation methods on experimental data, as measured by the mean squared error or Pearson's correlation coefficient. DeepImpute is an accurate, fast, and scalable imputation tool that is suited to handle the ever-increasing volume of scRNA-seq data, and is freely available at https://github.com/lanagarmire/DeepImpute .	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
31412909	2019	Genome biology	scAlign: a tool for alignment, integration, and rare cell identification from scRNA-seq data.	scRNA-seq dataset integration occurs in different contexts, such as the identification of cell type-specific differences in gene expression across conditions or species, or batch effect correction. We present scAlign, an unsupervised deep learning method for data integration that can incorporate partial, overlapping, or a complete set of cell labels, and estimate per-cell differences in gene expression across datasets. scAlign performance is state-of-the-art and robust to cross-dataset variation in cell type-specific expression and cell type composition. We demonstrate that scAlign reveals gene expression programs for rare populations of malaria parasites. Our framework is widely applicable to integration challenges in other domains.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
30923373	2019	Nature methods	Deep-learning augmented RNA-seq analysis of transcript splicing.	A major limitation of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of alternative splicing is its reliance on high sequencing coverage. We report DARTS (https://github.com/Xinglab/DARTS), a computational framework that integrates deep-learning-based predictions with empirical RNA-seq evidence to infer differential alternative splicing between biological samples. DARTS leverages public RNA-seq big data to provide a knowledge base of splicing regulation via deep learning, thereby helping researchers better characterize alternative splicing using RNA-seq datasets even with modest coverage.

30785874	2019	PLoS computational biology	Machine learning analysis of gene expression data reveals novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and identifies therapeutic targets for soft tissue sarcomas.	Based on morphology it is often challenging to distinguish between the many different soft tissue sarcoma subtypes. Moreover, outcome of disease is highly variable even between patients with the same disease. Machine learning on transcriptome sequencing data could be a valuable new tool to understand differences between and within entities. Here we used machine learning analysis to identify novel diagnostic and prognostic markers and therapeutic targets for soft tissue sarcomas. Gene expression data was used from the Cancer Genome Atlas, the Genotype-Tissue Expression project and the French Sarcoma Group. We identified three groups of tumors that overlap in their molecular profiles as seen with unsupervised t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding clustering and a deep neural network. The three groups corresponded to subtypes that are morphologically overlapping. Using a random forest algorithm, we identified novel diagnostic markers for soft tissue sarcoma that distinguished between synovial sarcoma and MPNST, and that we validated using qRT-PCR in an independent series. Next, we identified prognostic genes that are strong predictors of disease outcome when used in a k-nearest neighbor algorithm. The prognostic genes were further validated in expression data from the French Sarcoma Group. One of these, HMMR, was validated in an independent series of leiomyosarcomas using immunohistochemistry on tissue micro array as a prognostic gene for disease-free interval. Furthermore, reconstruction of regulatory networks combined with data from the Connectivity Map showed, amongst others, that HDAC inhibitors could be a potential effective therapy for multiple soft tissue sarcoma subtypes. A viability assay with two HDAC inhibitors confirmed that both leiomyosarcoma and synovial sarcoma are sensitive to HDAC inhibition. In this study we identified novel diagnostic markers, prognostic markers and therapeutic leads from multiple soft tissue sarcoma gene expression datasets. Thus, machine learning algorithms are powerful new tools to improve our understanding of rare tumor entities.	EST_or_microarray_records.tsv
31483777	2019	PLoS computational biology	Integrating thermodynamic and sequence contexts improves protein-RNA binding prediction.	Predicting RNA-binding protein (RBP) specificity is important for understanding gene expression regulation and RNA-mediated enzymatic processes. It is widely believed that RBP binding specificity is determined by both the sequence and structural contexts of RNAs. Existing approaches, including traditional machine learning algorithms and more recently, deep learning models, have been extensively applied to integrate RNA sequence and its predicted or experimental RNA structural probabilities for improving the accuracy of RBP binding prediction. Such models were trained mostly on the large-scale in vitro datasets, such as the RNAcompete dataset. However, in RNAcompete, most synthetic RNAs are unstructured, which makes machine learning methods not effectively extract RBP-binding structural preferences. Furthermore, RNA structure may be variable or multi-modal according to both theoretical and experimental evidence. In this work, we propose ThermoNet, a thermodynamic prediction model by integrating a new sequence-embedding convolutional neural network model over a thermodynamic ensemble of RNA secondary structures. First, the sequence-embedding convolutional neural network generalizes the existing k-mer based methods by jointly learning convolutional filters and k-mer embeddings to represent RNA sequence contexts. Second, the thermodynamic average of deep-learning predictions is able to explore structural variability and improves the prediction, especially for the structured RNAs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, including RCK, DeepBind and several other recent state-of-the-art methods for predictions on both in vitro and in vivo data. The implementation of ThermoNet is available at https://github.com/suyufeng/ThermoNet.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
31504186	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	DeepCOP: deep learning-based approach to predict gene regulating effects of small molecules.	MOTIVATION: Recent advances in the areas of bioinformatics and chemogenomics are poised to accelerate the discovery of small molecule regulators of cell development. Combining large genomics and molecular data sources with powerful deep learning techniques has the potential to revolutionize predictive biology. In this study, we present Deep gene COmpound Profiler (DeepCOP), a deep learning based model that can predict gene regulating effects of low-molecular weight compounds. This model can be used for direct identification of a drug candidate causing a desired gene expression response, without utilizing any information on its interactions with protein target(s). RESULTS: In this study, we successfully combined molecular fingerprint descriptors and gene descriptors (derived from gene ontology terms) to train deep neural networks that predict differential gene regulation endpoints collected in LINCS database. We achieved 10-fold cross-validation RAUC scores of and above 0.80, as well as enrichment factors of >5. We validated our models using an external RNA-Seq dataset generated in-house that described the effect of three potent antiandrogens (with different modes of action) on gene expression in LNCaP prostate cancer cell line. The results of this pilot study demonstrate that deep learning models can effectively synergize molecular and genomic descriptors and can be used to screen for novel drug candidates with the desired effect on gene expression. We anticipate that such models can find a broad use in developing novel cancer therapeutics and can facilitate precision oncology efforts.

32657403	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Factorized embeddings learns rich and biologically meaningful embedding spaces using factorized tensor decomposition.	MOTIVATION: The recent development of sequencing technologies revolutionized our understanding of the inner workings of the cell as well as the way disease is treated. A single RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) experiment, however, measures tens of thousands of parameters simultaneously. While the results are information rich, data analysis provides a challenge. Dimensionality reduction methods help with this task by extracting patterns from the data by compressing it into compact vector representations. RESULTS: We present the factorized embeddings (FE) model, a self-supervised deep learning algorithm that learns simultaneously, by tensor factorization, gene and sample representation spaces. We ran the model on RNA-Seq data from two large-scale cohorts and observed that the sample representation captures information on single gene and global gene expression patterns. Moreover, we found that the gene representation space was organized such that tissue-specific genes, highly correlated genes as well as genes participating in the same GO terms were grouped. Finally, we compared the vector representation of samples learned by the FE model to other similar models on 49 regression tasks. We report that the representations trained with FE rank first or second in all of the tasks, surpassing, sometimes by a considerable margin, other representations. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: A toy example in the form of a Jupyter Notebook as well as the code and trained embeddings for this project can be found at: https://github.com/TrofimovAssya/FactorizedEmbeddings.

33026062	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Style transfer with variational autoencoders is a promising approach to RNA-Seq data harmonization and analysis.	MOTIVATION: The transcriptomic data are being frequently used in the research of biomarker genes of different diseases and biological states. The most common tasks there are the data harmonization and treatment outcome prediction. Both of them can be addressed via the style transfer approach. Either technical factors or any biological details about the samples which we would like to control (gender, biological state, treatment, etc.) can be used as style components. RESULTS: The proposed style transfer solution is based on Conditional Variational Autoencoders, Y-Autoencoders and adversarial feature decomposition. To quantitatively measure the quality of the style transfer, neural network classifiers which predict the style and semantics after training on real expression were used. Comparison with several existing style-transfer based approaches shows that proposed model has the highest style prediction accuracy on all considered datasets while having comparable or the best semantics prediction accuracy.

32657401	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Improved survival analysis by learning shared genomic information from pan-cancer data.	MOTIVATION: Recent advances in deep learning have offered solutions to many biomedical tasks. However, there remains a challenge in applying deep learning to survival analysis using human cancer transcriptome data. As the number of genes, the input variables of survival model, is larger than the amount of available cancer patient samples, deep-learning models are prone to overfitting. To address the issue, we introduce a new deep-learning architecture called VAECox. VAECox uses transfer learning and fine tuning. RESULTS: We pre-trained a variational autoencoder on all RNA-seq data in 20 TCGA datasets and transferred the trained weights to our survival prediction model. Then we fine-tuned the transferred weights during training the survival model on each dataset. Results show that our model outperformed other previous models such as Cox Proportional Hazard with LASSO and ridge penalty and Cox-nnet on the 7 of 10 TCGA datasets in terms of C-index. The results signify that the transferred information obtained from entire cancer transcriptome data helped our survival prediction model reduce overfitting and show robust performance in unseen cancer patient samples. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Our implementation of VAECox is available at https://github.com/dmis-lab/VAECox. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

32415966	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scVAE: variational auto-encoders for single-cell gene expression data.	MOTIVATION: Models for analysing and making relevant biological inferences from massive amounts of complex single-cell transcriptomic data typically require several individual data-processing steps, each with their own set of hyperparameter choices. With deep generative models one can work directly with count data, make likelihood-based model comparison, learn a latent representation of the cells and capture more of the variability in different cell populations. RESULTS: We propose a novel method based on variational auto-encoders (VAEs) for analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. It avoids data preprocessing by using raw count data as input and can robustly estimate the expected gene expression levels and a latent representation for each cell. We tested several count likelihood functions and a variant of the VAE that has a priori clustering in the latent space. We show for several scRNA-seq datasets that our method outperforms recently proposed scRNA-seq methods in clustering cells and that the resulting clusters reflect cell types. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Our method, called scVAE, is implemented in Python using the TensorFlow machine-learning library, and it is freely available at https://github.com/scvae/scvae.

32176273	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Interpretable factor models of single-cell RNA-seq via variational autoencoders.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA-seq makes possible the investigation of variability in gene expression among cells, and dependence of variation on cell type. Statistical inference methods for such analyses must be scalable, and ideally interpretable. RESULTS: We present an approach based on a modification of a recently published highly scalable variational autoencoder framework that provides interpretability without sacrificing much accuracy. We demonstrate that our approach enables identification of gene programs in massive datasets. Our strategy, namely the learning of factor models with the auto-encoding variational Bayes framework, is not domain specific and may be useful for other applications.

33381839	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Conditional out-of-distribution generation for unpaired data using transfer VAE.	MOTIVATION: While generative models have shown great success in sampling high-dimensional samples conditional on low-dimensional descriptors (stroke thickness in MNIST, hair color in CelebA, speaker identity in WaveNet), their generation out-of-distribution poses fundamental problems due to the difficulty of learning compact joint distribution across conditions. The canonical example of the conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE), for instance, does not explicitly relate conditions during training and, hence, has no explicit incentive of learning such a compact representation. RESULTS: We overcome the limitation of the CVAE by matching distributions across conditions using maximum mean discrepancy in the decoder layer that follows the bottleneck. This introduces a strong regularization both for reconstructing samples within the same condition and for transforming samples across conditions, resulting in much improved generalization. As this amount to solving a style-transfer problem, we refer to the model as transfer VAE (trVAE). Benchmarking trVAE on high-dimensional image and single-cell RNA-seq, we demonstrate higher robustness and higher accuracy than existing approaches. We also show qualitatively improved predictions by tackling previously problematic minority classes and multiple conditions in the context of cellular perturbation response to treatment and disease based on high-dimensional single-cell gene expression data. For generic tasks, we improve Pearson correlations of high-dimensional estimated means and variances with their ground truths from 0.89 to 0.97 and 0.75 to 0.87, respectively. We further demonstrate that trVAE learns cell-type-specific responses after perturbation and improves the prediction of most cell-type-specific genes by 65%.

The results of this article can be reproduced via github.com/theislab/trvae_reproducibility.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
31808789	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	SpaCell: integrating tissue morphology and spatial gene expression to predict disease cells.	MOTIVATION: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technology is increasingly being applied because it enables the measurement of spatial gene expression in an intact tissue along with imaging morphology of the same tissue. However, current analysis methods for ST data do not use image pixel information, thus missing the quantitative links between gene expression and tissue morphology. RESULTS: We developed a user-friendly deep learning software, SpaCell, to integrate millions of pixel intensity values with thousands of gene expression measurements from spatially barcoded spots in a tissue. We show the integration approach outperforms the use of gene-count data alone or imaging data alone to build deep learning models to identify cell types or predict labels of tissue images with high resolution and accuracy.

32657371	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	AITL: Adversarial Inductive Transfer Learning with input and output space adaptation for pharmacogenomics.	MOTIVATION: The goal of pharmacogenomics is to predict drug response in patients using their single- or multi-omics data. A major challenge is that clinical data (i.e. patients) with drug response outcome is very limited, creating a need for transfer learning to bridge the gap between large pre-clinical pharmacogenomics datasets (e.g. cancer cell lines), as a source domain, and clinical datasets as a target domain. Two major discrepancies exist between pre-clinical and clinical datasets: (i) in the input space, the gene expression data due to difference in the basic biology, and (ii) in the output space, the different measures of the drug response. Therefore, training a computational model on cell lines and testing it on patients violates the i.i.d assumption that train and test data are from the same distribution. RESULTS: We propose Adversarial Inductive Transfer Learning (AITL), a deep neural network method for addressing discrepancies in input and output space between the pre-clinical and clinical datasets. AITL takes gene expression of patients and cell lines as the input, employs adversarial domain adaptation and multi-task learning to address these discrepancies, and predicts the drug response as the output. To the best of our knowledge, AITL is the first adversarial inductive transfer learning method to address both input and output discrepancies. Experimental results indicate that AITL outperforms state-of-the-art pharmacogenomics and transfer learning baselines and may guide precision oncology more accurately.

33381841	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	DeepCDR: a hybrid graph convolutional network for predicting cancer drug response.	MOTIVATION: Accurate prediction of cancer drug response (CDR) is challenging due to the uncertainty of drug efficacy and heterogeneity of cancer patients. Strong evidences have implicated the high dependence of CDR on tumor genomic and transcriptomic profiles of individual patients. Precise identification of CDR is crucial in both guiding anti-cancer drug design and understanding cancer biology. RESULTS: In this study, we present DeepCDR which integrates multi-omics profiles of cancer cells and explores intrinsic chemical structures of drugs for predicting CDR. Specifically, DeepCDR is a hybrid graph convolutional network consisting of a uniform graph convolutional network and multiple subnetworks. Unlike prior studies modeling hand-crafted features of drugs, DeepCDR automatically learns the latent representation of topological structures among atoms and bonds of drugs. Extensive experiments showed that DeepCDR outperformed state-of-the-art methods in both classification and regression settings under various data settings. We also evaluated the contribution of different types of omics profiles for assessing drug response. Furthermore, we provided an exploratory strategy for identifying potential cancer-associated genes concerning specific cancer types. Our results highlighted the predictive power of DeepCDR and its potential translational value in guiding disease-specific drug design.

32560708	2020	Genome biology	Enhanced Integrated Gradients: improving interpretability of deep learning models using splicing codes as a case study.	Despite the success and fast adaptation of deep learning models in biomedical domains, their lack of interpretability remains an issue. Here, we introduce Enhanced Integrated Gradients (EIG), a method to identify significant features associated with a specific prediction task. Using RNA splicing prediction as well as digit classification as case studies, we demonstrate that EIG improves upon the original Integrated Gradients method and produces sets of informative features. We then apply EIG to identify A1CF as a key regulator of liver-specific alternative splicing, supporting this finding with subsequent analysis of relevant A1CF functional (RNA-seq) and binding data (PAR-CLIP).

32650816	2020	Genome biology	DISC: a highly scalable and accurate inference of gene expression and structure for single-cell transcriptomes using semi-supervised deep learning.	Dropouts distort gene expression and misclassify cell types in single-cell transcriptome. Although imputation may improve gene expression and downstream analysis to some degree, it also inevitably introduces false signals. We develop DISC, a novel deep learning network with semi-supervised learning to infer gene structure and expression obscured by dropouts. Compared with seven state-of-the-art imputation approaches on ten real-world datasets, we show that DISC consistently outperforms the other approaches. Its applicability, scalability, and reliability make DISC a promising approach to recover gene expression, enhance gene and cell structures, and improve cell type identification for sparse scRNA-seq data.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
32746932	2020	Genome biology	Knowledge-primed neural networks enable biologically interpretable deep learning on single-cell sequencing data.	BACKGROUND: Deep learning has emerged as a versatile approach for predicting complex biological phenomena. However, its utility for biological discovery has so far been limited, given that generic deep neural networks provide little insight into the biological mechanisms that underlie a successful prediction. Here we demonstrate deep learning on biological networks, where every node has a molecular equivalent, such as a protein or gene, and every edge has a mechanistic interpretation, such as a regulatory interaction along a signaling pathway. RESULTS: With knowledge-primed neural networks (KPNNs), we exploit the ability of deep learning algorithms to assign meaningful weights in multi-layered networks, resulting in a widely applicable approach for interpretable deep learning. We present a learning method that enhances the interpretability of trained KPNNs by stabilizing node weights in the presence of redundancy, enhancing the quantitative interpretability of node weights, and controlling for uneven connectivity in biological networks. We validate KPNNs on simulated data with known ground truth and demonstrate their practical use and utility in five biological applications with single-cell RNA-seq data for cancer and immune cells. CONCLUSIONS: We introduce KPNNs as a method that combines the predictive power of deep learning with the interpretability of biological networks. While demonstrated here on single-cell sequencing data, this method is broadly relevant to other research areas where prior domain knowledge can be represented as networks.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
33303016	2020	Genome biology	GCNG: graph convolutional networks for inferring gene interaction from spatial transcriptomics data.	Most methods for inferring gene-gene interactions from expression data focus on intracellular interactions. The availability of high-throughput spatial expression data opens the door to methods that can infer such interactions both within and between cells. To achieve this, we developed Graph Convolutional Neural networks for Genes (GCNG). GCNG encodes the spatial information as a graph and combines it with expression data using supervised training. GCNG improves upon prior methods used to analyze spatial transcriptomics data and can propose novel pairs of extracellular interacting genes. The output of GCNG can also be used for downstream analysis including functional gene assignment.Supporting website with software and data: https://github.com/xiaoyeye/GCNG .	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
32907883	2020	Genome research	Molecular barcoding of native RNAs using nanopore sequencing and deep learning.	Nanopore sequencing enables direct measurement of RNA molecules without conversion to cDNA, thus opening the gates to a new era for RNA biology. However, the lack of molecular barcoding of direct RNA nanopore sequencing data sets severely affects the applicability of this technology to biological samples, where RNA availability is often limited. Here, we provide the first experimental protocol and associated algorithm to barcode and demultiplex direct RNA nanopore sequencing data sets. Specifically, we present a novel and robust approach to accurately classify raw nanopore signal data by transforming current intensities into images or arrays of pixels, followed by classification using a deep learning algorithm. We demonstrate the power of this strategy by developing the first experimental protocol for barcoding and demultiplexing direct RNA sequencing libraries. Our method, DeePlexiCon, can classify 93% of reads with 95.1% accuracy or 60% of reads with 99.9% accuracy. The availability of an efficient and simple multiplexing strategy for native RNA sequencing will improve the cost-effectiveness of this technology, as well as facilitate the analysis of lower-input biological samples. Overall, our work exemplifies the power, simplicity, and robustness of signal-to-image conversion for nanopore data analysis using deep learning.	RNA-seq_records.filtered.tsv
31932729	2020	Nature biotechnology	Titrating gene expression using libraries of systematically attenuated CRISPR guide RNAs.	A lack of tools to precisely control gene expression has limited our ability to evaluate relationships between expression levels and phenotypes. Here, we describe an approach to titrate expression of human genes using CRISPR interference and series of single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) with systematically modulated activities. We used large-scale measurements across multiple cell models to characterize activities of sgRNAs containing mismatches to their target sites and derived rules governing mismatched sgRNA activity using deep learning. These rules enabled us to synthesize a compact sgRNA library to titrate expression of ~2,400 genes essential for robust cell growth and to construct an in silico sgRNA library spanning the human genome. Staging cells along a continuum of gene expression levels combined with single-cell RNA-seq readout revealed sharp transitions in cellular behaviors at gene-specific expression thresholds. Our work provides a general tool to control gene expression, with applications ranging from tuning biochemical pathways to identifying suppressors for diseases of dysregulated gene expression.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
33077966	2020	Nature methods	MARS: discovering novel cell types across heterogeneous single-cell experiments.	Although tremendous effort has been put into cell-type annotation, identification of previously uncharacterized cell types in heterogeneous single-cell RNA-seq data remains a challenge. Here we present MARS, a meta-learning approach for identifying and annotating known as well as new cell types. MARS overcomes the heterogeneity of cell types by transferring latent cell representations across multiple datasets. MARS uses deep learning to learn a cell embedding function as well as a set of landmarks in the cell embedding space. The method has a unique ability to discover cell types that have never been seen before and annotate experiments that are as yet unannotated. We apply MARS to a large mouse cell atlas and show its ability to accurately identify cell types, even when it has never seen them before. Further, MARS automatically generates interpretable names for new cell types by probabilistically defining a cell type in the embedding space.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
32232416	2020	Nucleic acids research	Uncovering the key dimensions of high-throughput biomolecular data using deep learning.	Recent advances in high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq have enabled us to measure thousands of gene expression levels at single-cell resolution. However, the transcriptomic profiles are high-dimensional and sparse in nature. To address it, a deep learning framework based on auto-encoder, termed DeepAE, is proposed to elucidate high-dimensional transcriptomic profiling data in an encode-decode manner. Comparative experiments were conducted on nine transcriptomic profiling datasets to compare DeepAE with four benchmark methods. The results demonstrate that the proposed DeepAE outperforms the benchmark methods with robust performance on uncovering the key dimensions of single-cell RNA-seq data. In addition, we also investigate the performance of DeepAE in other contexts and platforms such as mass cytometry and metabolic profiling in a comprehensive manner. Gene ontology enrichment and pathology analysis are conducted to reveal the mechanisms behind the robust performance of DeepAE by uncovering its key dimensions.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
32588900	2020	Nucleic acids research	scIGANs: single-cell RNA-seq imputation using generative adversarial networks.	Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables the characterization of transcriptomic profiles at the single-cell resolution with increasingly high throughput. However, it suffers from many sources of technical noises, including insufficient mRNA molecules that lead to excess false zero values, termed dropouts. Computational approaches have been proposed to recover the biologically meaningful expression by borrowing information from similar cells in the observed dataset. However, these methods suffer from oversmoothing and removal of natural cell-to-cell stochasticity in gene expression. Here, we propose the generative adversarial networks (GANs) for scRNA-seq imputation (scIGANs), which uses generated cells rather than observed cells to avoid these limitations and balances the performance between major and rare cell populations. Evaluations based on a variety of simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets show that scIGANs is effective for dropout imputation and enhances various downstream analysis. ScIGANs is robust to small datasets that have very few genes with low expression and/or cell-to-cell variance. ScIGANs works equally well on datasets from different scRNA-seq protocols and is scalable to datasets with over 100 000 cells. We demonstrated in many ways with compelling evidence that scIGANs is not only an application of GANs in omics data but also represents a competing imputation method for the scRNA-seq data.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
32706788	2020	PLoS computational biology	A practical application of generative adversarial networks for RNA-seq analysis to predict the molecular progress of Alzheimer's disease.	Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has become a powerful tool for dissecting the molecular and pathological signatures of a variety of human diseases. However, the limited availability of biological samples from different disease stages is a major hurdle in studying disease progressions and identifying early pathological changes. Deep learning techniques have recently begun to be applied to analyze NGS data and thereby predict the progression of biological processes. In this study, we applied a deep learning technique called generative adversarial networks (GANs) to predict the molecular progress of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We successfully applied GANs to analyze RNA-seq data from a 5xFAD mouse model of AD, which recapitulates major AD features of massive amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation in the brain. We examined how the generator is featured to have specific-sample generation and biological gene association. Based on the above observations, we suggested virtual disease progress by latent space interpolation to yield the transition curves of various genes with pathological changes from normal to AD state. By performing pathway analysis based on the transition curve patterns, we identified several pathological processes with progressive changes, such as inflammatory systems and synapse functions, which have previously been demonstrated to be involved in the pathogenesis of AD. Interestingly, our analysis indicates that alteration of cholesterol biosynthesis begins at a very early stage of AD, suggesting that it is the first effect to mediate the cholesterol metabolism of AD downstream of Abeta accumulation. Here, we suggest that GANs are a useful tool to study disease progression, leading to the identification of early pathological signatures.	RNA-seq_records.filtered.tsv
33325516	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Helixer: cross-species gene annotation of large eukaryotic genomes using deep learning.	MOTIVATION: Current state-of-the-art tools for the de novo annotation of genes in eukaryotic genomes have to be specifically fitted for each species and still often produce annotations that can be improved much further. The fundamental algorithmic architecture for these tools has remained largely unchanged for about two decades, limiting learning capabilities. Here, we set out to improve the cross-species annotation of genes from DNA sequence alone with the help of deep learning. The goal is to eliminate the dependency on a closely related gene model while also improving the predictive quality in general with a fundamentally new architecture. RESULTS: We present Helixer, a framework for the development and usage of a cross-species deep learning model that improves significantly on performance and generalizability when compared to more traditional methods. We evaluate our approach by building a single vertebrate model for the base-wise annotation of 186 animal genomes and a separate land plant model for 51 plant genomes. Our predictions are shown to be much less sensitive to the length of the genome than those of a current state-of-the-art tool. We also present two novel post-processing techniques that each worked to further strengthen our annotations and show in-depth results of an RNA-Seq based comparison of our predictions. Our method does not yet produce comprehensive gene models but rather outputs base pair wise probabilities.

33244583	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Novel SARS-CoV-2 encoded small RNAs in the passage to humans.	MOTIVATION: The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has recently emerged as the responsible for the pandemic outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019. This virus is closely related to coronaviruses infecting bats and Malayan pangolins, species suspected to be an intermediate host in the passage to humans. Several genomic mutations affecting viral proteins have been identified, contributing to the understanding of the recent animal-to-human transmission. However, the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to encode functional putative microRNAs (miRNAs) remains largely unexplored. RESULTS: We have used deep learning to discover 12 candidate stem-loop structures hidden in the viral protein-coding genome. Among the precursors, the expression of eight mature miRNAs-like sequences was confirmed in small RNA-seq data from SARS-CoV-2 infected human cells. Predicted miRNAs are likely to target a subset of human genes of which 109 are transcriptionally deregulated upon infection. Remarkably, 28 of those genes potentially targeted by SARS-CoV-2 miRNAs are down-regulated in infected human cells. Interestingly, most of them have been related to respiratory diseases and viral infection, including several afflictions previously associated with SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. The comparison of SARS-CoV-2 pre-miRNA sequences with those from bat and pangolin coronaviruses suggests that single nucleotide mutations could have helped its progenitors jumping inter-species boundaries, allowing the gain of novel mature miRNAs targeting human mRNAs. Our results suggest that the recent acquisition of novel miRNAs-like sequences in the SARS-CoV-2 genome may have contributed to modulate the transcriptional reprograming of the new host upon infection.

30768159	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Dhaka: variational autoencoder for unmasking tumor heterogeneity from single cell genomic data.	MOTIVATION: Intra-tumor heterogeneity is one of the key confounding factors in deciphering tumor evolution. Malignant cells exhibit variations in their gene expression, copy numbers and mutation even when originating from a single progenitor cell. Single cell sequencing of tumor cells has recently emerged as a viable option for unmasking the underlying tumor heterogeneity. However, extracting features from single cell genomic data in order to infer their evolutionary trajectory remains computationally challenging due to the extremely noisy and sparse nature of the data. RESULTS: Here we describe 'Dhaka', a variational autoencoder method which transforms single cell genomic data to a reduced dimension feature space that is more efficient in differentiating between (hidden) tumor subpopulations. Our method is general and can be applied to several different types of genomic data including copy number variation from scDNA-Seq and gene expression from scRNA-Seq experiments. We tested the method on synthetic and six single cell cancer datasets where the number of cells ranges from 250 to 6000 for each sample. Analysis of the resulting feature space revealed subpopulations of cells and their marker genes. The features are also able to infer the lineage and/or differentiation trajectory between cells greatly improving upon prior methods suggested for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction of such data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: All the datasets used in the paper are publicly available and developed software package and supporting info is available on Github https://github.com/MicrosoftGenomics/Dhaka.

33974010	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	MAT2: manifold alignment of single-cell transcriptomes with cell triplets.	MOTIVATION: Aligning single-cell transcriptomes is important for the joint analysis of multiple single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, which in turn is vital to establishing a holistic cellular landscape of certain biological processes. Although numbers of approaches have been proposed for this problem, most of which only consider mutual neighbors when aligning the cells without taking into account known cell type annotations. RESULTS: In this work, we present MAT2 that aligns cells in the manifold space with a deep neural network employing contrastive learning strategy. Compared with other manifold-based approaches, MAT2 has two-fold advantages. Firstly, with cell triplets defined based on known cell type annotations, the consensus manifold yielded by the alignment procedure is more robust especially for datasets with limited common cell types. Secondly, the batch-effect-free gene expression reconstructed by MAT2 can better help annotate cell types. Benchmarking results on real scRNA-seq datasets demonstrate that MAT2 outperforms existing popular methods. Moreover, with MAT2, the hematopoietic stem cells are found to differentiate at different paces between human and mouse.

33226074	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Deep feature extraction of single-cell transcriptomes by generative adversarial network.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers the opportunity to dissect heterogeneous cellular compositions and interrogate the cell-type-specific gene expression patterns across diverse conditions. However, batch effects such as laboratory conditions and individual-variability hinder their usage in cross-condition designs. RESULTS: Here, we present a single-cell Generative Adversarial Network (scGAN) to simultaneously acquire patterns from raw data while minimizing the confounding effect driven by technical artifacts or other factors inherent to the data. Specifically, scGAN models the data likelihood of the raw scRNA-seq counts by projecting each cell onto a latent embedding. Meanwhile, scGAN attempts to minimize the correlation between the latent embeddings and the batch labels across all cells. We demonstrate scGAN on three public scRNA-seq datasets and show that our method confers superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods in forming clusters of known cell types and identifying known psychiatric genes that are associated with major depressive disorder. AVAILABILITYAND IMPLEMENTATION: The scGAN code and the information for the public scRNA-seq datasets are available at https://github.com/li-lab-mcgill/singlecell-deepfeature.

34028557	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Deep cross-omics cycle attention model for joint analysis of single-cell multi-omics data.	MOTIVATION: Joint profiling of single-cell transcriptomics and epigenomics data enables us to characterize cell states and transcriptomics regulatory programs related to cellular heterogeneity. However, the highly different features on sparsity, heterogeneity and dimensionality between multi-omics data have severely hindered its integrative analysis. RESULTS: We proposed deep cross-omics cycle attention (DCCA) model, a computational tool for joint analysis of single-cell multi-omics data, by combining variational autoencoders (VAEs) and attention-transfer. Specifically, we show that DCCA can leverage one omics data to fine-tune the network trained for another omics data, given a dataset of parallel multi-omics data within the same cell. Studies on both simulated and real datasets from various platforms, DCCA demonstrates its superior capability: (i) dissecting cellular heterogeneity; (ii) denoising and aggregating data and (iii) constructing the link between multi-omics data, which is used to infer new transcriptional regulatory relations. In our applications, DCCA was demonstrated to have a superior power to generate missing stages or omics in a biologically meaningful manner, which provides a new way to analyze and also understand complicated biological processes. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: DCCA source code is available at https://github.com/cmzuo11/DCCA, and has been deposited in archived format at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4762065.

34128955	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	A convolutional neural network for common coordinate registration of high-resolution histology images.	MOTIVATION: Registration of histology images from multiple sources is a pressing problem in large-scale studies of spatial -omics data. Researchers often perform 'common coordinate registration', akin to segmentation, in which samples are partitioned based on tissue type to allow for quantitative comparison of similar regions across samples. Accuracy in such registration requires both high image resolution and global awareness, which mark a difficult balancing act for contemporary deep learning architectures. RESULTS: We present a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that combines (i) a local classification CNN that extracts features from image patches sampled sparsely across the tissue surface and (ii) a global segmentation CNN that operates on these extracted features. This hybrid network can be trained in an end-to-end manner, and we demonstrate its relative merits over competing approaches on a reference histology dataset as well as two published spatial transcriptomics datasets. We believe that this paradigm will greatly enhance our ability to process spatial -omics data, and has general purpose applications for the processing of high-resolution histology images on commercially available GPUs.

33126245	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	Identification of pan-cancer Ras pathway activation with deep learning.	The identification of hidden responders is often an essential challenge in precision oncology. A recent attempt based on machine learning has been proposed for classifying aberrant pathway activity from multiomic cancer data. However, we note several critical limitations there, such as high-dimensionality, data sparsity and model performance. Given the central importance and broad impact of precision oncology, we propose nature-inspired deep Ras activation pan-cancer (NatDRAP), a deep neural network (DNN) model, to address those restrictions for the identification of hidden responders. In this study, we develop the nature-inspired deep learning model that integrates bulk RNA sequencing, copy number and mutation data from PanCanAltas to detect pan-cancer Ras pathway activation. In NatDRAP, we propose to synergize the nature-inspired artificial bee colony algorithm with different gradient-based optimizers in one framework for optimizing DNNs in a collaborative manner. Multiple experiments were conducted on 33 different cancer types across PanCanAtlas. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed NatDRAP can provide superior performance over other benchmark methods with strong robustness towards diagnosing RAS aberrant pathway activity across different cancer types. In addition, gene ontology enrichment and pathological analysis are conducted to reveal novel insights into the RAS aberrant pathway activity identification and characterization. NatDRAP is written in Python and available at https://github.com/lixt314/NatDRAP1.	RNA-seq_records.filtered.tsv
34424948	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	DeepDRIM: a deep neural network to reconstruct cell-type-specific gene regulatory network using single-cell RNA-seq data.	Single-cell RNA sequencing has enabled to capture the gene activities at single-cell resolution, thus allowing reconstruction of cell-type-specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs). The available algorithms for reconstructing GRNs are commonly designed for bulk RNA-seq data, and few of them are applicable to analyze scRNA-seq data by dealing with the dropout events and cellular heterogeneity. In this paper, we represent the joint gene expression distribution of a gene pair as an image and propose a novel supervised deep neural network called DeepDRIM which utilizes the image of the target TF-gene pair and the ones of the potential neighbors to reconstruct GRN from scRNA-seq data. Due to the consideration of TF-gene pair's neighborhood context, DeepDRIM can effectively eliminate the false positives caused by transitive gene-gene interactions. We compared DeepDRIM with nine GRN reconstruction algorithms designed for either bulk or single-cell RNA-seq data. It achieves evidently better performance for the scRNA-seq data collected from eight cell lines. The simulated data show that DeepDRIM is robust to the dropout rate, the cell number and the size of the training data. We further applied DeepDRIM to the scRNA-seq gene expression of B cells from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of the patients with mild and severe coronavirus disease 2019. We focused on the cell-type-specific GRN alteration and observed targets of TFs that were differentially expressed between the two statuses to be enriched in lysosome, apoptosis, response to decreased oxygen level and microtubule, which had been proved to be associated with coronavirus infection.

33876191	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	Deep learning of gene relationships from single cell time-course expression data.	Time-course gene-expression data have been widely used to infer regulatory and signaling relationships between genes. Most of the widely used methods for such analysis were developed for bulk expression data. Single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) data offer several advantages including the large number of expression profiles available and the ability to focus on individual cells rather than averages. However, the data also raise new computational challenges. Using a novel encoding for scRNA-Seq expression data, we develop deep learning methods for interaction prediction from time-course data. Our methods use a supervised framework which represents the data as 3D tensor and train convolutional and recurrent neural networks for predicting interactions. We tested our time-course deep learning (TDL) models on five different time-series scRNA-Seq datasets. As we show, TDL can accurately identify causal and regulatory gene-gene interactions and can also be used to assign new function to genes. TDL improves on prior methods for the above tasks and can be generally applied to new time-series scRNA-Seq data.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
33822890	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	DeepDRK: a deep learning framework for drug repurposing through kernel-based multi-omics integration.	Recent pharmacogenomic studies that generate sequencing data coupled with pharmacological characteristics for patient-derived cancer cell lines led to large amounts of multi-omics data for precision cancer medicine. Among various obstacles hindering clinical translation, lacking effective methods for multimodal and multisource data integration is becoming a bottleneck. Here we proposed DeepDRK, a machine learning framework for deciphering drug response through kernel-based data integration. To transfer information among different drugs and cancer types, we trained deep neural networks on more than 20 000 pan-cancer cell line-anticancer drug pairs. These pairs were characterized by kernel-based similarity matrices integrating multisource and multi-omics data including genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, chemical properties of compounds and known drug-target interactions. Applied to benchmark cancer cell line datasets, our model surpassed previous approaches with higher accuracy and better robustness. Then we applied our model on newly established patient-derived cancer cell lines and achieved satisfactory performance with AUC of 0.84 and AUPRC of 0.77. Moreover, DeepDRK was used to predict clinical response of cancer patients. Notably, the prediction of DeepDRK correlated well with clinical outcome of patients and revealed multiple drug repurposing candidates. In sum, DeepDRK provided a computational method to predict drug response of cancer cells from integrating pharmacogenomic datasets, offering an alternative way to prioritize repurposing drugs in precision cancer treatment. The DeepDRK is freely available via https://github.com/wangyc82/DeepDRK.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
33341877	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	PharmKG: a dedicated knowledge graph benchmark for bomedical data mining.	Biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs), which can help with the understanding of complex biological systems and pathologies, have begun to play a critical role in medical practice and research. However, challenges remain in their embedding and use due to their complex nature and the specific demands of their construction. Existing studies often suffer from problems such as sparse and noisy datasets, insufficient modeling methods and non-uniform evaluation metrics. In this work, we established a comprehensive KG system for the biomedical field in an attempt to bridge the gap. Here, we introduced PharmKG, a multi-relational, attributed biomedical KG, composed of more than 500 000 individual interconnections between genes, drugs and diseases, with 29 relation types over a vocabulary of ~8000 disambiguated entities. Each entity in PharmKG is attached with heterogeneous, domain-specific information obtained from multi-omics data, i.e. gene expression, chemical structure and disease word embedding, while preserving the semantic and biomedical features. For baselines, we offered nine state-of-the-art KG embedding (KGE) approaches and a new biological, intuitive, graph neural network-based KGE method that uses a combination of both global network structure and heterogeneous domain features. Based on the proposed benchmark, we conducted extensive experiments to assess these KGE models using multiple evaluation metrics. Finally, we discussed our observations across various downstream biological tasks and provide insights and guidelines for how to use a KG in biomedicine. We hope that the unprecedented quality and diversity of PharmKG will lead to advances in biomedical KG construction, embedding and application.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv

Simultaneous profiling transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility information in the same individual cells offers an unprecedented resolution to understand cell states. However, computationally effective methods for the integration of these inherent sparse and heterogeneous data are lacking. Here, we present a single-cell multimodal variational autoencoder model, which combines three types of joint-learning strategies with a probabilistic Gaussian Mixture Model to learn the joint latent features that accurately represent these multilayer profiles. Studies on both simulated datasets and real datasets demonstrate that it has more preferable capability (i) dissecting cellular heterogeneity in the joint-learning space, (ii) denoising and imputing data and (iii) constructing the association between multilayer omics data, which can be used for understanding transcriptional regulatory mechanisms.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv

Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) profiles gene expression with high resolution. Here, we develop a stepwise computational method-called SCAPTURE to identify, evaluate, and quantify cleavage and polyadenylation sites (PASs) from 3' tag-based scRNA-seq. SCAPTURE detects PASs de novo in single cells with high sensitivity and accuracy, enabling detection of previously unannotated PASs. Quantified alternative PAS transcripts refine cell identity analysis beyond gene expression, enriching information extracted from scRNA-seq data. Using SCAPTURE, we show changes of PAS usage in PBMCs from infected versus healthy individuals at single-cell resolution.	RNA-seq_records.filtered.tsv

Deep generative models such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) generate and manipulate high-dimensional images. We systematically assess the complementary strengths and weaknesses of these models on single-cell gene expression data. We also develop MichiGAN, a novel neural network that combines the strengths of VAEs and GANs to sample from disentangled representations without sacrificing data generation quality. We learn disentangled representations of three large single-cell RNA-seq datasets and use MichiGAN to sample from these representations. MichiGAN allows us to manipulate semantically distinct aspects of cellular identity and predict single-cell gene expression response to drug treatment.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv

The integration of single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets from multiple sources is critical for deciphering cell-to-cell heterogeneities and interactions in complex biological systems. We present a novel unsupervised batch effect removal framework, called iMAP, based on both deep autoencoders and generative adversarial networks. Compared with current methods, iMAP shows superior, robust, and scalable performance in terms of both reliably detecting the batch-specific cells and effectively mixing distributions of the batch-shared cell types. Applying iMAP to tumor microenvironment datasets from two platforms, Smart-seq2 and 10x Genomics, we find that iMAP can leverage the powers of both platforms to discover novel cell-cell interactions.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
34035047	2021	Genome research	A joint deep learning model enables simultaneous batch effect correction, denoising, and clustering in single-cell transcriptomics.	Recent developments of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) technologies have led to enormous biological discoveries. As the scale of scRNA-seq studies increases, a major challenge in analysis is batch effects, which are inevitable in studies involving human tissues. Most existing methods remove batch effects in a low-dimensional embedding space. Although useful for clustering, batch effects are still present in the gene expression space, leaving downstream gene-level analysis susceptible to batch effects. Recent studies have shown that batch effect correction in the gene expression space is much harder than in the embedding space. Methods such as Seurat 3.0 rely on the mutual nearest neighbor (MNN) approach to remove batch effects in gene expression, but MNN can only analyze two batches at a time, and it becomes computationally infeasible when the number of batches is large. Here, we present CarDEC, a joint deep learning model that simultaneously clusters and denoises scRNA-seq data while correcting batch effects both in the embedding and the gene expression space. Comprehensive evaluations spanning different species and tissues showed that CarDEC outperforms Scanorama, DCA + Combat, scVI, and MNN. With CarDEC denoising, non-highly variable genes offer as much signal for clustering as the highly variable genes (HVGs), suggesting that CarDEC substantially boosted information content in scRNA-seq. We also showed that trajectory analysis using CarDEC's denoised and batch-corrected expression as input revealed marker genes and transcription factors that are otherwise obscured in the presence of batch effects. CarDEC is computationally fast, making it a desirable tool for large-scale scRNA-seq studies.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
34301623	2021	Genome research	A graph neural network model to estimate cell-wise metabolic flux using single-cell RNA-seq data.	The metabolic heterogeneity and metabolic interplay between cells are known as significant contributors to disease treatment resistance. However, with the lack of a mature high-throughput single-cell metabolomics technology, we are yet to establish systematic understanding of the intra-tissue metabolic heterogeneity and cooperative mechanisms. To mitigate this knowledge gap, we developed a novel computational method, namely, single-cell flux estimation analysis (scFEA), to infer the cell-wise fluxome from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. scFEA is empowered by a systematically reconstructed human metabolic map as a factor graph, a novel probabilistic model to leverage the flux balance constraints on scRNA-seq data, and a novel graph neural network-based optimization solver. The intricate information cascade from transcriptome to metabolome was captured using multilayer neural networks to capitulate the nonlinear dependency between enzymatic gene expressions and reaction rates. We experimentally validated scFEA by generating an scRNA-seq data set with matched metabolomics data on cells of perturbed oxygen and genetic conditions. Application of scFEA on this data set showed the consistency between predicted flux and the observed variation of metabolite abundance in the matched metabolomics data. We also applied scFEA on five publicly available scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data sets and identified context- and cell group-specific metabolic variations. The cell-wise fluxome predicted by scFEA empowers a series of downstream analyses including identification of metabolic modules or cell groups that share common metabolic variations, sensitivity evaluation of enzymes with regards to their impact on the whole metabolic flux, and inference of cell-tissue and cell-cell metabolic communications.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
34711971	2021	Nature methods	Deep learning and alignment of spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomes with Tangram.	Charting an organs' biological atlas requires us to spatially resolve the entire single-cell transcriptome, and to relate such cellular features to the anatomical scale. Single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq (sc/snRNA-seq) can profile cells comprehensively, but lose spatial information. Spatial transcriptomics allows for spatial measurements, but at lower resolution and with limited sensitivity. Targeted in situ technologies solve both issues, but are limited in gene throughput. To overcome these limitations we present Tangram, a method that aligns sc/snRNA-seq data to various forms of spatial data collected from the same region, including MERFISH, STARmap, smFISH, Spatial Transcriptomics (Visium) and histological images. Tangram can map any type of sc/snRNA-seq data, including multimodal data such as those from SHARE-seq, which we used to reveal spatial patterns of chromatin accessibility. We demonstrate Tangram on healthy mouse brain tissue, by reconstructing a genome-wide anatomically integrated spatial map at single-cell resolution of the visual and somatomotor areas.

34500471	2021	Nucleic acids research	scDeepSort: a pre-trained cell-type annotation method for single-cell transcriptomics using deep learning with a weighted graph neural network.	Advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have furthered the simultaneous classification of thousands of cells in a single assay based on transcriptome profiling. In most analysis protocols, single-cell type annotation relies on marker genes or RNA-seq profiles, resulting in poor extrapolation. Still, the accurate cell-type annotation for single-cell transcriptomic data remains a great challenge. Here, we introduce scDeepSort (https://github.com/ZJUFanLab/scDeepSort), a pre-trained cell-type annotation tool for single-cell transcriptomics that uses a deep learning model with a weighted graph neural network (GNN). Using human and mouse scRNA-seq data resources, we demonstrate the high performance and robustness of scDeepSort in labeling 764 741 cells involving 56 human and 32 mouse tissues. Significantly, scDeepSort outperformed other known methods in annotating 76 external test datasets, reaching an 83.79% accuracy across 265 489 cells in humans and mice. Moreover, we demonstrate the universality of scDeepSort using more challenging datasets and using references from different scRNA-seq technology. Above all, scDeepSort is the first attempt to annotate cell types of scRNA-seq data with a pre-trained GNN model, which can realize the accurate cell-type annotation without additional references, i.e. markers or RNA-seq profiles.

33619564	2021	Nucleic acids research	Discovery of molecular features underlying the morphological landscape by integrating spatial transcriptomic data with deep features of tissue images.	Profiling molecular features associated with the morphological landscape of tissue is crucial for investigating the structural and spatial patterns that underlie the biological function of tissues. In this study, we present a new method, spatial gene expression patterns by deep learning of tissue images (SPADE), to identify important genes associated with morphological contexts by combining spatial transcriptomic data with coregistered images. SPADE incorporates deep learning-derived image patterns with spatially resolved gene expression data to extract morphological context markers. Morphological features that correspond to spatial maps of the transcriptome were extracted by image patches surrounding each spot and were subsequently represented by image latent features. The molecular profiles correlated with the image latent features were identified. The extracted genes could be further analyzed to discover functional terms and exploited to extract clusters maintaining morphological contexts. We apply our approach to spatial transcriptomic data from different tissues, platforms and types of images to demonstrate an unbiased method that is capable of obtaining image-integrated gene expression trends.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
33861746	2021	PLoS computational biology	Genome-wide analysis of lncRNA stability in human.	Transcript stability is associated with many biological processes, and the factors affecting mRNA stability have been extensively studied. However, little is known about the features related to human long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) stability. By inhibiting transcription and collecting samples in 10 time points, genome-wide RNA-seq studies was performed in human lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549) and RNA half-life datasets were constructed. The following observations were obtained. First, the half-life distributions of both lncRNAs and messanger RNAs (mRNAs) with one exon (lnc-human1 and m-human1) were significantly different from those of both lncRNAs and mRNAs with more than one exon (lnc-human2 and m-human2). Furthermore, some factors such as full-length transcript secondary structures played a contrary role in lnc-human1 and m-human2. Second, through the half-life comparisons of nucleus- and cytoplasm-specific and common lncRNAs and mRNAs, lncRNAs (mRNAs) in the nucleus were found to be less stable than those in the cytoplasm, which was derived from transcripts themselves rather than cellular location. Third, kmers-based protein-RNA or RNA-RNA interactions promoted lncRNA stability from lnc-human1 and decreased mRNA stability from m-human2 with high probability. Finally, through applying deep learning-based regression, a non-linear relationship was found to exist between the half-lives of lncRNAs (mRNAs) and related factors. The present study established lncRNA and mRNA half-life regulation networks in the A549 cell line and shed new light on the degradation behaviors of both lncRNAs and mRNAs.

34634029	2021	PLoS computational biology	Improved prediction of smoking status via isoform-aware RNA-seq deep learning models.	Most predictive models based on gene expression data do not leverage information related to gene splicing, despite the fact that splicing is a fundamental feature of eukaryotic gene expression. Cigarette smoking is an important environmental risk factor for many diseases, and it has profound effects on gene expression. Using smoking status as a prediction target, we developed deep neural network predictive models using gene, exon, and isoform level quantifications from RNA sequencing data in 2,557 subjects in the COPDGene Study. We observed that models using exon and isoform quantifications clearly outperformed gene-level models when using data from 5 genes from a previously published prediction model. Whereas the test set performance of the previously published model was 0.82 in the original publication, our exon-based models including an exon-to-isoform mapping layer achieved a test set AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic) of 0.88, which improved to an AUC of 0.94 using exon quantifications from a larger set of genes. Isoform variability is an important source of latent information in RNA-seq data that can be used to improve clinical prediction models.	RNA-seq_records.filtered.tsv
33939691	2021	PLoS computational biology	Pseudocell Tracer-A method for inferring dynamic trajectories using scRNAseq and its application to B cells undergoing immunoglobulin class switch recombination.	Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) can be used to infer a temporal ordering of cellular states. Current methods for the inference of cellular trajectories rely on unbiased dimensionality reduction techniques. However, such biologically agnostic ordering can prove difficult for modeling complex developmental or differentiation processes. The cellular heterogeneity of dynamic biological compartments can result in sparse sampling of key intermediate cell states. To overcome these limitations, we develop a supervised machine learning framework, called Pseudocell Tracer, which infers trajectories in pseudospace rather than in pseudotime. The method uses a supervised encoder, trained with adjacent biological information, to project scRNAseq data into a low-dimensional manifold that maps the transcriptional states a cell can occupy. Then a generative adversarial network (GAN) is used to simulate pesudocells at regular intervals along a virtual cell-state axis. We demonstrate the utility of Pseudocell Tracer by modeling B cells undergoing immunoglobulin class switch recombination (CSR) during a prototypic antigen-induced antibody response. Our results revealed an ordering of key transcription factors regulating CSR to the IgG1 isotype, including the concomitant expression of Nfkb1 and Stat6 prior to the upregulation of Bach2 expression. Furthermore, the expression dynamics of genes encoding cytokine receptors suggest a poised IL-4 signaling state that preceeds CSR to the IgG1 isotype.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
34191792	2021	PLoS computational biology	Mixture-of-Experts Variational Autoencoder for clustering and generating from similarity-based representations on single cell data.	Clustering high-dimensional data, such as images or biological measurements, is a long-standing problem and has been studied extensively. Recently, Deep Clustering has gained popularity due to its flexibility in fitting the specific peculiarities of complex data. Here we introduce the Mixture-of-Experts Similarity Variational Autoencoder (MoE-Sim-VAE), a novel generative clustering model. The model can learn multi-modal distributions of high-dimensional data and use these to generate realistic data with high efficacy and efficiency. MoE-Sim-VAE is based on a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), where the decoder consists of a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. This specific architecture allows for various modes of the data to be automatically learned by means of the experts. Additionally, we encourage the lower dimensional latent representation of our model to follow a Gaussian mixture distribution and to accurately represent the similarities between the data points. We assess the performance of our model on the MNIST benchmark data set and challenging real-world tasks of clustering mouse organs from single-cell RNA-sequencing measurements and defining cell subpopulations from mass cytometry (CyTOF) measurements on hundreds of different datasets. MoE-Sim-VAE exhibits superior clustering performance on all these tasks in comparison to the baselines as well as competitor methods.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
35266505	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	GraphGONet: a self-explaining neural network encapsulating the Gene Ontology graph for phenotype prediction on gene expression.	MOTIVATION: Medical care is becoming more and more specific to patients' needs due to the increased availability of omics data. The application to these data of sophisticated machine learning models, in particular deep learning (DL), can improve the field of precision medicine. However, their use in clinics is limited as their predictions are not accompanied by an explanation. The production of accurate and intelligible predictions can benefit from the inclusion of domain knowledge. Therefore, knowledge-based DL models appear to be a promising solution. RESULTS: In this article, we propose GraphGONet, where the Gene Ontology is encapsulated in the hidden layers of a new self-explaining neural network. Each neuron in the layers represents a biological concept, combining the gene expression profile of a patient and the information from its neighboring neurons. The experiments described in the article confirm that our model not only performs as accurately as the state-of-the-art (non-explainable ones) but also automatically produces stable and intelligible explanations composed of the biological concepts with the highest contribution. This feature allows experts to use our tool in a medical setting. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: GraphGONet is freely available at https://forge.ibisc.univ-evry.fr/vbourgeais/GraphGONet.git. The microarray dataset is accessible from the ArrayExpress database under the identifier E-MTAB-3732. The TCGA datasets can be downloaded from the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) data portal.

34788368	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Deep graph representations embed network information for robust disease marker identification.	MOTIVATION: Accurate disease diagnosis and prognosis based on omics data rely on the effective identification of robust prognostic and diagnostic markers that reflect the states of the biological processes underlying the disease pathogenesis and progression. In this article, we present GCNCC, a Graph Convolutional Network-based approach for Clustering and Classification, that can identify highly effective and robust network-based disease markers. Based on a geometric deep learning framework, GCNCC learns deep network representations by integrating gene expression data with protein interaction data to identify highly reproducible markers with consistently accurate prediction performance across independent datasets possibly from different platforms. GCNCC identifies these markers by clustering the nodes in the protein interaction network based on latent similarity measures learned by the deep architecture of a graph convolutional network, followed by a supervised feature selection procedure that extracts clusters that are highly predictive of the disease state. RESULTS: By benchmarking GCNCC based on independent datasets from different diseases (psychiatric disorder and cancer) and different platforms (microarray and RNA-seq), we show that GCNCC outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and reproducibility.

34623402	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	SMILE: mutual information learning for integration of single-cell omics data.	MOTIVATION: Deep learning approaches have empowered single-cell omics data analysis in many ways and generated new insights from complex cellular systems. As there is an increasing need for single-cell omics data to be integrated across sources, types and features of data, the challenges of integrating single-cell omics data are rising. Here, we present an unsupervised deep learning algorithm that learns discriminative representations for single-cell data via maximizing mutual information, SMILE (Single-cell Mutual Information Learning). RESULTS: Using a unique cell-pairing design, SMILE successfully integrates multisource single-cell transcriptome data, removing batch effects and projecting similar cell types, even from different tissues, into the shared space. SMILE can also integrate data from two or more modalities, such as joint-profiling technologies using single-cell ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, DNA methylation, Hi-C and ChIP data. When paired cells are known, SMILE can integrate data with unmatched feature, such as genes for RNA-seq and genome-wide peaks for ATAC-seq. Integrated representations learned from joint-profiling technologies can then be used as a framework for comparing independent single source data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code of SMILE including analyses of key results in the study can be found at: https://github.com/rpmccordlab/SMILE, implemented in Python.

36063052	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	ABEILLE: a novel method for ABerrant Expression Identification empLoying machine LEarning from RNA-sequencing data.	MOTIVATION: Current advances in omics technologies are paving the diagnosis of rare diseases proposing a complementary assay to identify the responsible gene. The use of transcriptomic data to identify aberrant gene expression (AGE) has demonstrated to yield potential pathogenic events. However, popular approaches for AGE identification are limited by the use of statistical tests that imply the choice of arbitrary cut-off for significance assessment and the availability of several replicates not always possible in clinical contexts. RESULTS: Hence, we developed ABerrant Expression Identification empLoying machine LEarning from sequencing data (ABEILLE) a variational autoencoder (VAE)-based method for the identification of AGEs from the analysis of RNA-seq data without the need for replicates or a control group. ABEILLE combines the use of a VAE, able to model any data without specific assumptions on their distribution, and a decision tree to classify genes as AGE or non-AGE. An anomaly score is associated with each gene in order to stratify AGE by the severity of aberration. We tested ABEILLE on a semi-synthetic and an experimental dataset demonstrating the importance of the flexibility of the VAE configuration to identify potential pathogenic candidates. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: ABEILLE source code is freely available at: https://github.com/UCA-MSI/ABEILLE. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

35771600	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	ResPAN: a powerful batch correction model for scRNA-seq data through residual adversarial networks.	MOTIVATION: With the advancement of technology, we can generate and access large-scale, high dimensional and diverse genomics data, especially through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). However, integrative downstream analysis from multiple scRNA-seq datasets remains challenging due to batch effects. RESULTS: In this article, we propose a light-structured deep learning framework called ResPAN for scRNA-seq data integration. ResPAN is based on Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) combined with random walk mutual nearest neighbor pairing and fully skip-connected autoencoders to reduce the differences among batches. We also discuss the limitations of existing methods and demonstrate the advantages of our model over seven other methods through extensive benchmarking studies on both simulated data under various scenarios and real datasets across different scales. Our model achieves leading performance on both batch correction and biological information conservation and maintains scalable to datasets with over half a million cells.

36250784	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scGNN 2.0: a graph neural network tool for imputation and clustering of single-cell RNA-Seq data.	MOTIVATION: Gene expression imputation has been an essential step of the single-cell RNA-Seq data analysis workflow. Among several deep-learning methods, the debut of scGNN gained substantial recognition in 2021 for its superior performance and the ability to produce a cell-cell graph. However, the implementation of scGNN was relatively time-consuming and its performance could still be optimized. RESULTS: The implementation of scGNN 2.0 is significantly faster than scGNN thanks to a simplified close-loop architecture. For all eight datasets, cell clustering performance was increased by 85.02% on average in terms of adjusted rand index, and the imputation Median L1 Error was reduced by 67.94% on average. With the built-in visualizations, users can quickly assess the imputation and cell clustering results, compare against benchmarks and interpret the cell-cell interaction. The expanded input and output formats also pave the way for custom workflows that integrate scGNN 2.0 with other scRNA-Seq toolkits on both Python and R platforms. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: scGNN 2.0 is implemented in Python (as of version 3.8) with the source code available at https://github.com/OSU-BMBL/scGNN2.0.

35179571	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	ACTIVA: realistic single-cell RNA-seq generation with automatic cell-type identification using introspective variational autoencoders.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) technologies allow for measurements of gene expression at a single-cell resolution. This provides researchers with a tremendous advantage for detecting heterogeneity, delineating cellular maps or identifying rare subpopulations. However, a critical complication remains: the low number of single-cell observations due to limitations by rarity of subpopulation, tissue degradation or cost. This absence of sufficient data may cause inaccuracy or irreproducibility of downstream analysis. In this work, we present Automated Cell-Type-informed Introspective Variational Autoencoder (ACTIVA): a novel framework for generating realistic synthetic data using a single-stream adversarial variational autoencoder conditioned with cell-type information. Within a single framework, ACTIVA can enlarge existing datasets and generate specific subpopulations on demand, as opposed to two separate models [such as single-cell GAN (scGAN) and conditional scGAN (cscGAN)]. Data generation and augmentation with ACTIVA can enhance scRNAseq pipelines and analysis, such as benchmarking new algorithms, studying the accuracy of classifiers and detecting marker genes. ACTIVA will facilitate analysis of smaller datasets, potentially reducing the number of patients and animals necessary in initial studies. RESULTS: We train and evaluate models on multiple public scRNAseq datasets. In comparison to GAN-based models (scGAN and cscGAN), we demonstrate that ACTIVA generates cells that are more realistic and harder for classifiers to identify as synthetic which also have better pair-wise correlation between genes. Data augmentation with ACTIVA significantly improves classification of rare subtypes (more than 45% improvement compared with not augmenting and 4% better than cscGAN) all while reducing run-time by an order of magnitude in comparison to both models. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The codes and datasets are hosted on Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5879639). Tutorials are available at https://github.com/SindiLab/ACTIVA.

35639705	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scPreGAN, a deep generative model for predicting the response of single-cell expression to perturbation.	MOTIVATION: Rapid developments of single-cell RNA sequencing technologies allow study of responses to external perturbations at individual cell level. However, in many cases, it is hard to collect the perturbed cells, such as knowing the response of a cell type to the drug before actual medication to a patient. Prediction in silicon could alleviate the problem and save cost. Although several tools have been developed, their prediction accuracy leaves much room for improvement. RESULTS: In this article, we propose scPreGAN (Single-Cell data Prediction base on GAN), a deep generative model for predicting the response of single-cell expression to perturbation. ScPreGAN integrates autoencoder and generative adversarial network, the former is to extract common information of the unperturbed data and the perturbed data, the latter is to predict the perturbed data. Experiments on three real datasets show that scPreGAN outperforms three state-of-the-art methods, which can capture the complicated distribution of cell expression and generate the prediction data with the same expression abundance as the real data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The implementation of scPreGAN is available via https://github.com/JaneJiayiDong/scPreGAN.

36193998	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scSemiGAN: a single-cell semi-supervised annotation and dimensionality reduction framework based on generative adversarial network.	MOTIVATION: Cell-type annotation plays a crucial role in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data analysis. As more and more well-annotated scRNA-seq reference data are publicly available, automatical label transference algorithms are gaining popularity over manual marker gene-based annotation methods. However, most existing methods fail to unify cell-type annotation with dimensionality reduction and are unable to generate deep latent representation from the perspective of data generation. RESULTS: In this article, we propose scSemiGAN, a single-cell semi-supervised cell-type annotation and dimensionality reduction framework based on a generative adversarial network, to overcome these challenges, modeling scRNA-seq data from the aspect of data generation. Our proposed scSemiGAN is capable of performing deep latent representation learning and cell-type label prediction simultaneously. Through extensive comparison with four state-of-the-art annotation methods on diverse simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets, scSemiGAN achieves competitive or superior performance in multiple downstream tasks including cell-type annotation, latent representation visualization, confounding factor removal and enrichment analysis.

34623390	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scMRA: a robust deep learning method to annotate scRNA-seq data with multiple reference datasets.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) has been widely used to resolve cellular heterogeneity. After collecting scRNA-seq data, the natural next step is to integrate the accumulated data to achieve a common ontology of cell types and states. Thus, an effective and efficient cell-type identification method is urgently needed. Meanwhile, high-quality reference data remain a necessity for precise annotation. However, such tailored reference data are always lacking in practice. To address this, we aggregated multiple datasets into a meta-dataset on which annotation is conducted. Existing supervised or semi-supervised annotation methods suffer from batch effects caused by different sequencing platforms, the effect of which increases in severity with multiple reference datasets. RESULTS: Herein, a robust deep learning-based single-cell Multiple Reference Annotator (scMRA) is introduced. In scMRA, a knowledge graph is constructed to represent the characteristics of cell types in different datasets, and a graphic convolutional network serves as a discriminator based on this graph. scMRA keeps intra-cell-type closeness and the relative position of cell types across datasets. scMRA is remarkably powerful at transferring knowledge from multiple reference datasets, to the unlabeled target domain, thereby gaining an advantage over other state-of-the-art annotation methods in multi-reference data experiments. Furthermore, scMRA can remove batch effects. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use multiple insufficient reference datasets to annotate target data, and it is, comparatively, the best annotation method for multiple scRNA-seq datasets. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: An implementation of scMRA is available from https://github.com/ddb-qiwang/scMRA-torch.

34999761	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scNAME: neighborhood contrastive clustering with ancillary mask estimation for scRNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: The rapid development of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) makes it possible to study the heterogeneity of individual cell characteristics. Cell clustering is a vital procedure in scRNA-seq analysis, providing insight into complex biological phenomena. However, the noisy, high-dimensional and large-scale nature of scRNA-seq data introduces challenges in clustering analysis. Up to now, many deep learning-based methods have emerged to learn underlying feature representations while clustering. However, these methods are inefficient when it comes to rare cell type identification and barely able to fully utilize gene dependencies or cell similarity integrally. As a result, they cannot detect a clear cell type structure which is required for clustering accuracy as well as downstream analysis. RESULTS: Here, we propose a novel scRNA-seq clustering algorithm called scNAME which incorporates a mask estimation task for gene pertinence mining and a neighborhood contrastive learning framework for cell intrinsic structure exploitation. The learned pattern through mask estimation helps reveal uncorrupted data structure and denoise the original single-cell data. In addition, the randomly created augmented data introduced in contrastive learning not only helps improve robustness of clustering, but also increases sample size in each cluster for better data capacity. Beyond this, we also introduce a neighborhood contrastive paradigm with an offline memory bank, global in scope, which can inspire discriminative feature representation and achieve intra-cluster compactness, yet inter-cluster separation. The combination of mask estimation task, neighborhood contrastive learning and global memory bank designed in scNAME is conductive to rare cell type detection. The experimental results of both simulations and real data confirm that our method is accurate, robust and scalable. We also implement biological analysis, including marker gene identification, gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis, to validate the biological significance of our method. To the best of our knowledge, we are among the first to introduce a gene relationship exploration strategy, as well as a global cellular similarity repository, in the single-cell field.

35394015	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scGraph: a graph neural network-based approach to automatically identify cell types.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell technologies play a crucial role in revolutionizing biological research over the past decade, which strengthens our understanding in cell differentiation, development and regulation from a single-cell level perspective. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is one of the most common single cell technologies, which enables probing transcriptional states in thousands of cells in one experiment. Identification of cell types from scRNA-seq measurements is a fundamental and crucial question to answer. Most previous studies directly take gene expression as input while ignoring the comprehensive gene-gene interactions. RESULTS: We propose scGraph, an automatic cell identification algorithm leveraging gene interaction relationships to enhance the performance of the cell-type identification. scGraph is based on a graph neural network to aggregate the information of interacting genes. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate that scGraph is accurate and outperforms eight comparison methods in the task of cell-type identification. Moreover, scGraph automatically learns the gene interaction relationships from biological data and the pathway enrichment analysis shows consistent findings with previous analysis, providing insights on the analysis of regulatory mechanism.

MOTIVATION: To develop and assess the accuracy of deep learning models that identify different retinal cell types, as well as different retinal ganglion cell (RGC) subtypes, based on patterns of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in multiple datasets. RESULTS: Deep domain adaptation models were developed and tested using three different datasets. The first dataset included 44 808 single retinal cells from mice (39 cell types) with 24 658 genes, the second dataset included 6225 single RGCs from mice (41 subtypes) with 13 616 genes and the third dataset included 35 699 single RGCs from mice (45 subtypes) with 18 222 genes. We used four loss functions in the learning process to align the source and target distributions, reduce misclassification errors and maximize robustness. Models were evaluated based on classification accuracy and confusion matrix. The accuracy of the model for correctly classifying 39 different retinal cell types in the first dataset was  approximately 92%. Accuracy in the second and third datasets reached  approximately 97% and 97% in correctly classifying 40 and 45 different RGCs subtypes, respectively. Across a range of seven different batches in the first dataset, the accuracy of the lead model ranged from 74% to nearly 100%. The lead model provided high accuracy in identifying retinal cell types and RGC subtypes based on scRNA-seq data. The performance was reasonable based on data from different batches as well. The validated model could be readily applied to scRNA-seq data to identify different retinal cell types and subtypes. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The code and datasets are available on https://github.com/DM2LL/Detecting-Retinal-Cell-Classes-and-Ganglion-Cell-Subtypes. We have also added the class labels of all samples to the datasets. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
34864918	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	HDMC: a novel deep learning-based framework for removing batch effects in single-cell RNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: With the development of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) techniques, increasingly more large-scale gene expression datasets become available. However, to analyze datasets produced by different experiments, batch effects among different datasets must be considered. Although several methods have been recently published to remove batch effects in scRNA-seq data, two problems remain to be challenging and not completely solved: (i) how to reduce the distribution differences of different batches more accurately; and (ii) how to align samples from different batches to recover the cell type clusters. RESULTS: We proposed a novel deep-learning approach, which is a hierarchical distribution-matching framework assisted with contrastive learning to address these two problems. Firstly, we design a hierarchical framework for distribution matching based on a deep autoencoder. This framework employs an adversarial training strategy to match the global distribution of different batches. This provides an improved foundation to further match the local distributions with a maximum mean discrepancy-based loss. For local matching, we divide cells in each batch into clusters and develop a contrastive learning mechanism to simultaneously align similar cluster pairs and keep noisy pairs apart from each other. This allows to obtain clusters with all cells of the same type (true positives), and avoid clusters with cells of different type (false positives). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both simulated and real datasets. Results show that our new method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and has the ability to prevent overcorrection. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The python code to generate results and figures in this article is available at https://github.com/zhanglabNKU/HDMC, the data underlying this article is also available at this github repository.

34864884	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	CellVGAE: an unsupervised scRNA-seq analysis workflow with graph attention networks.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing allows high-resolution views of individual cells for libraries of up to millions of samples, thus motivating the use of deep learning for analysis. In this study, we introduce the use of graph neural networks for the unsupervised exploration of scRNA-seq data by developing a variational graph autoencoder architecture with graph attention layers that operates directly on the connectivity between cells, focusing on dimensionality reduction and clustering. With the help of several case studies, we show that our model, named CellVGAE, can be effectively used for exploratory analysis even on challenging datasets, by extracting meaningful features from the data and providing the means to visualize and interpret different aspects of the model. RESULTS: We show that CellVGAE is more interpretable than existing scRNA-seq variational architectures by analysing the graph attention coefficients. By drawing parallels with other scRNA-seq studies on interpretability, we assess the validity of the relationships modelled by attention, and furthermore, we show that CellVGAE can intrinsically capture information such as pseudotime and NF-kB activation dynamics, the latter being a property that is not generally shared by existing neural alternatives. We then evaluate the dimensionality reduction and clustering performance on 9 difficult and well-annotated datasets by comparing with three leading neural and non-neural techniques, concluding that CellVGAE outperforms competing methods. Finally, we report a decrease in training times of up to x 20 on a dataset of 1.3 million cells compared to existing deep learning architectures.

36124793	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	GNN-SubNet: disease subnetwork detection with explainable graph neural networks.	MOTIVATION: The tremendous success of graphical neural networks (GNNs) already had a major impact on systems biology research. For example, GNNs are currently being used for drug target recognition in protein-drug interaction networks, as well as for cancer gene discovery and more. Important aspects whose practical relevance is often underestimated are comprehensibility, interpretability and explainability. RESULTS: In this work, we present a novel graph-based deep learning framework for disease subnetwork detection via explainable GNNs. Each patient is represented by the topology of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, and the nodes are enriched with multi-omics features from gene expression and DNA methylation. In addition, we propose a modification of the GNNexplainer that provides model-wide explanations for improved disease subnetwork detection. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The proposed methods and tools are implemented in the GNN-SubNet Python package, which we have made available on our GitHub for the international research community (https://github.com/pievos101/GNN-SubNet).

36271868	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	DeepPerVar: a multi-modal deep learning framework for functional interpretation of genetic variants in personal genome.	MOTIVATION: Understanding the functional consequence of genetic variants, especially the non-coding ones, is important but particularly challenging. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) or quantitative trait locus analyses may be subject to limited statistical power and linkage disequilibrium, and thus are less optimal to pinpoint the causal variants. Moreover, most existing machine-learning approaches, which exploit the functional annotations to interpret and prioritize putative causal variants, cannot accommodate the heterogeneity of personal genetic variations and traits in a population study, targeting a specific disease. RESULTS: By leveraging paired whole-genome sequencing data and epigenetic functional assays in a population study, we propose a multi-modal deep learning framework to predict genome-wide quantitative epigenetic signals by considering both personal genetic variations and traits. The proposed approach can further evaluate the functional consequence of non-coding variants on an individual level by quantifying the allelic difference of predicted epigenetic signals. By applying the approach to the ROSMAP cohort studying Alzheimer's disease (AD), we demonstrate that the proposed approach can accurately predict quantitative genome-wide epigenetic signals and in key genomic regions of AD causal genes, learn canonical motifs reported to regulate gene expression of AD causal genes, improve the partitioning heritability analysis and prioritize putative causal variants in a GWAS risk locus. Finally, we release the proposed deep learning model as a stand-alone Python toolkit and a web server. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: https://github.com/lichen-lab/DeepPerVar.

35323894	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	iGRLCDA: identifying circRNA-disease association based on graph representation learning.	While the technologies of ribonucleic acid-sequence (RNA-seq) and transcript assembly analysis have continued to improve, a novel topology of RNA transcript was uncovered in the last decade and is called circular RNA (circRNA). Recently, researchers have revealed that they compete with messenger RNA (mRNA) and long noncoding for combining with microRNA in gene regulation. Therefore, circRNA was assumed to be associated with complex disease and discovering the relationship between them would contribute to medical research. However, the work of identifying the association between circRNA and disease in vitro takes a long time and usually without direction. During these years, more and more associations were verified by experiments. Hence, we proposed a computational method named identifying circRNA-disease association based on graph representation learning (iGRLCDA) for the prediction of the potential association of circRNA and disease, which utilized a deep learning model of graph convolution network (GCN) and graph factorization (GF). In detail, iGRLCDA first derived the hidden feature of known associations between circRNA and disease using the Gaussian interaction profile (GIP) kernel combined with disease semantic information to form a numeric descriptor. After that, it further used the deep learning model of GCN and GF to extract hidden features from the descriptor. Finally, the random forest classifier is introduced to identify the potential circRNA-disease association. The five-fold cross-validation of iGRLCDA shows strong competitiveness in comparison with other excellent prediction models at the gold standard data and achieved an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.9289 and an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.9377. On reviewing the prediction results from the relevant literature, 22 of the top 30 predicted circRNA-disease associations were noted in recent published papers. These exceptional results make us believe that iGRLCDA can provide reliable circRNA-disease associations for medical research and reduce the blindness of wet-lab experiments.

34585236	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	Stratified neural networks in a time-to-event setting.	Deep neural networks are frequently employed to predict survival conditional on omics-type biomarkers, e.g., by employing the partial likelihood of Cox proportional hazards model as loss function. Due to the generally limited number of observations in clinical studies, combining different data sets has been proposed to improve learning of network parameters. However, if baseline hazards differ between the studies, the assumptions of Cox proportional hazards model are violated. Based on high dimensional transcriptome profiles from different tumor entities, we demonstrate how using a stratified partial likelihood as loss function allows for accounting for the different baseline hazards in a deep learning framework. Additionally, we compare the partial likelihood with the ranking loss, which is frequently employed as loss function in machine learning approaches due to its seemingly simplicity. Using RNA-seq data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) we show that use of stratified loss functions leads to an overall better discriminatory power and lower prediction error compared to their non-stratified counterparts. We investigate which genes are identified to have the greatest marginal impact on prediction of survival when using different loss functions. We find that while similar genes are identified, in particular known prognostic genes receive higher importance from stratified loss functions. Taken together, pooling data from different sources for improved parameter learning of deep neural networks benefits largely from employing stratified loss functions that consider potentially varying baseline hazards. For easy application, we provide PyTorch code for stratified loss functions and an explanatory Jupyter notebook in a GitHub repository.	RNA-seq_records.filtered.tsv
35849101	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	Spatial transcriptomics prediction from histology jointly through Transformer and graph neural networks.	The rapid development of spatial transcriptomics allows the measurement of RNA abundance at a high spatial resolution, making it possible to simultaneously profile gene expression, spatial locations of cells or spots, and the corresponding hematoxylin and eosin-stained histology images. It turns promising to predict gene expression from histology images that are relatively easy and cheap to obtain. For this purpose, several methods are devised, but they have not fully captured the internal relations of the 2D vision features or spatial dependency between spots. Here, we developed Hist2ST, a deep learning-based model to predict RNA-seq expression from histology images. Around each sequenced spot, the corresponding histology image is cropped into an image patch and fed into a convolutional module to extract 2D vision features. Meanwhile, the spatial relations with the whole image and neighbored patches are captured through Transformer and graph neural network modules, respectively. These learned features are then used to predict the gene expression by following the zero-inflated negative binomial distribution. To alleviate the impact by the small spatial transcriptomics data, a self-distillation mechanism is employed for efficient learning of the model. By comprehensive tests on cancer and normal datasets, Hist2ST was shown to outperform existing methods in terms of both gene expression prediction and spatial region identification. Further pathway analyses indicated that our model could reserve biological information. Thus, Hist2ST enables generating spatial transcriptomics data from histology images for elucidating molecular signatures of tissues.	RNA-seq_records.filtered.tsv
34472585	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	ScCAEs: deep clustering of single-cell RNA-seq via convolutional autoencoder embedding and soft K-means.	Clustering and cell type classification are a vital step of analyzing scRNA-seq data to reveal the complexity of the tissue (e.g. the number of cell types and the transcription characteristics of the respective cell type). Recently, deep learning-based single-cell clustering algorithms become popular since they integrate the dimensionality reduction with clustering. But these methods still have unstable clustering effects for the scRNA-seq datasets with high dropouts or noise. In this study, a novel single-cell RNA-seq deep embedding clustering via convolutional autoencoder embedding and soft K-means (scCAEs) is proposed by simultaneously learning the feature representation and clustering. It integrates the deep learning with convolutional autoencoder to characterize scRNA-seq data and proposes a regularized soft K-means algorithm to cluster cell populations in a learned latent space. Next, a novel constraint is introduced to the clustering objective function to iteratively optimize the clustering results, and more importantly, it is theoretically proved that this objective function optimization ensures the convergence. Moreover, it adds the reconstruction loss to the objective function combining the dimensionality reduction with clustering to find a more suitable embedding space for clustering. The proposed method is validated on a variety of datasets, in which the number of clusters in the mentioned datasets ranges from 4 to 46, and the number of cells ranges from 90 to 30 302. The experimental results show that scCAEs is superior to other state-of-the-art methods on the mentioned datasets, and it also keeps the satisfying compatibility and robustness. In addition, for single-cell datasets with the batch effects, scCAEs can ensure the cell separation while removing batch effects.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
34929734	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	Deep learning tackles single-cell analysis-a survey of deep learning for scRNA-seq analysis.	Since its selection as the method of the year in 2013, single-cell technologies have become mature enough to provide answers to complex research questions. With the growth of single-cell profiling technologies, there has also been a significant increase in data collected from single-cell profilings, resulting in computational challenges to process these massive and complicated datasets. To address these challenges, deep learning (DL) is positioned as a competitive alternative for single-cell analyses besides the traditional machine learning approaches. Here, we survey a total of 25 DL algorithms and their applicability for a specific step in the single cell RNA-seq processing pipeline. Specifically, we establish a unified mathematical representation of variational autoencoder, autoencoder, generative adversarial network and supervised DL models, compare the training strategies and loss functions for these models, and relate the loss functions of these models to specific objectives of the data processing step. Such a presentation will allow readers to choose suitable algorithms for their particular objective at each step in the pipeline. We envision that this survey will serve as an important information portal for learning the application of DL for scRNA-seq analysis and inspire innovative uses of DL to address a broader range of new challenges in emerging multi-omics and spatial single-cell sequencing.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
36168811	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	dynDeepDRIM: a dynamic deep learning model to infer direct regulatory interactions using time-course single-cell gene expression data.	Time-course single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data have been widely used to explore dynamic changes in gene expression of transcription factors (TFs) and their target genes. This information is useful to reconstruct cell-type-specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs). However, the existing tools are commonly designed to analyze either time-course bulk gene expression data or static scRNA-seq data via pseudo-time cell ordering. A few methods successfully utilize the information from multiple time points while also considering the characteristics of scRNA-seq data. We proposed dynDeepDRIM, a novel deep learning model to reconstruct GRNs using time-course scRNA-seq data. It represents the joint expression of a gene pair as an image and utilizes the image of the target TF-gene pair and the ones of the potential neighbors to reconstruct GRNs from time-course scRNA-seq data. dynDeepDRIM can effectively remove the transitive TF-gene interactions by considering neighborhood context and model the gene expression dynamics using high-dimensional tensors. We compared dynDeepDRIM with six GRN reconstruction methods on both simulation and four real time-course scRNA-seq data. dynDeepDRIM achieved substantially better performance than the other methods in inferring TF-gene interactions and eliminated the false positives effectively. We also applied dynDeepDRIM to annotate gene functions and found it achieved evidently better performance than the other tools due to considering the neighbor genes.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
35914950	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	Learning discriminative and structural samples for rare cell types with deep generative model.	Cell types (subpopulations) serve as bio-markers for the diagnosis and therapy of complex diseases, and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) measures expression of genes at cell level, paving the way for the identification of cell types. Although great efforts have been devoted to this issue, it remains challenging to identify rare cell types in scRNA-seq data because of the few-shot problem, lack of interpretability and separation of generating samples and clustering of cells. To attack these issues, a novel deep generative model for leveraging the small samples of cells (aka scLDS2) is proposed by precisely estimating the distribution of different cells, which discriminate the rare and non-rare cell types with adversarial learning. Specifically, to enhance interpretability of samples, scLDS2 generates the sparse faked samples of cells with $\ell _1$-norm, where the relations among cells are learned, facilitating the identification of cell types. Furthermore, scLDS2 directly obtains cell types from the generated samples by learning the block structure such that cells belonging to the same types are similar to each other with the nuclear-norm. scLDS2 joins the generation of samples, classification of the generated and truth samples for cells and feature extraction into a unified generative framework, which transforms the rare cell types detection problem into a classification problem, paving the way for the identification of cell types with joint learning. The experimental results on 20 datasets demonstrate that scLDS2 significantly outperforms 17 state-of-the-art methods in terms of various measurements with 25.12% improvement in adjusted rand index on average, providing an effective strategy for scRNA-seq data with rare cell types.

34849562	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	Deep learning-based advances and applications for single-cell RNA-sequencing data analysis.	The rapid development of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has raised significant computational and analytical challenges. The application of deep learning to scRNA-seq data analysis is rapidly evolving and can overcome the unique challenges in upstream (quality control and normalization) and downstream (cell-, gene- and pathway-level) analysis of scRNA-seq data. In the present study, recent advances and applications of deep learning-based methods, together with specific tools for scRNA-seq data analysis, were summarized. Moreover, the future perspectives and challenges of deep-learning techniques regarding the appropriate analysis and interpretation of scRNA-seq data were investigated. The present study aimed to provide evidence supporting the biomedical application of deep learning-based tools and may aid biologists and bioinformaticians in navigating this exciting and fast-moving area.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
34472590	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	A comparison of deep learning-based pre-processing and clustering approaches for single-cell RNA sequencing data.	The emergence of single cell RNA sequencing has facilitated the studied of genomes, transcriptomes and proteomes. As available single-cell RNA-seq datasets are released continuously, one of the major challenges facing traditional RNA analysis tools is the high-dimensional, high-sparsity, high-noise and large-scale characteristics of single-cell RNA-seq data. Deep learning technologies match the characteristics of single-cell RNA-seq data perfectly and offer unprecedented promise. Here, we give a systematic review for most popular single-cell RNA-seq analysis methods and tools based on deep learning models, involving the procedures of data preprocessing (quality control, normalization, data correction, dimensionality reduction and data visualization) and clustering task for downstream analysis. We further evaluate the deep model-based analysis methods of data correction and clustering quantitatively on 11 gold standard datasets. Moreover, we discuss the data preferences of these methods and their limitations, and give some suggestions and guidance for users to select appropriate methods and tools.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
34962260	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	SIGNET: single-cell RNA-seq-based gene regulatory network prediction using multiple-layer perceptron bagging.	High-throughput single-cell RNA-seq data have provided unprecedented opportunities for deciphering the regulatory interactions among genes. However, such interactions are complex and often nonlinear or nonmonotonic, which makes their inference using linear models challenging. We present SIGNET, a deep learning-based framework for capturing complex regulatory relationships between genes under the assumption that the expression levels of transcription factors participating in gene regulation are strong predictors of the expression of their target genes. Evaluations based on a variety of real and simulated scRNA-seq datasets showed that SIGNET is more sensitive to ChIP-seq validated regulatory interactions in different types of cells, particularly rare cells. Therefore, this process is more effective for various downstream analyses, such as cell clustering and gene regulatory network inference. We demonstrated that SIGNET is a useful tool for identifying important regulatory modules driving various biological processes.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
35172334	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	Deep structural clustering for single-cell RNA-seq data jointly through autoencoder and graph neural network.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) permits researchers to study the complex mechanisms of cell heterogeneity and diversity. Unsupervised clustering is of central importance for the analysis of the scRNA-seq data, as it can be used to identify putative cell types. However, due to noise impacts, high dimensionality and pervasive dropout events, clustering analysis of scRNA-seq data remains a computational challenge. Here, we propose a new deep structural clustering method for scRNA-seq data, named scDSC, which integrate the structural information into deep clustering of single cells. The proposed scDSC consists of a Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) model-based autoencoder, a graph neural network (GNN) module and a mutual-supervised module. To learn the data representation from the sparse and zero-inflated scRNA-seq data, we add a ZINB model to the basic autoencoder. The GNN module is introduced to capture the structural information among cells. By joining the ZINB-based autoencoder with the GNN module, the model transfers the data representation learned by autoencoder to the corresponding GNN layer. Furthermore, we adopt a mutual supervised strategy to unify these two different deep neural architectures and to guide the clustering task. Extensive experimental results on six real scRNA-seq datasets demonstrate that scDSC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of clustering accuracy and scalability. Our method scDSC is implemented in Python using the Pytorch machine-learning library, and it is freely available at https://github.com/DHUDBlab/scDSC.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
34553763	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	High-throughput single-cell RNA-seq data imputation and characterization with surrogate-assisted automated deep learning.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have been heavily developed to probe gene expression profiles at single-cell resolution. Deep imputation methods have been proposed to address the related computational challenges (e.g. the gene sparsity in single-cell data). In particular, the neural architectures of those deep imputation models have been proven to be critical for performance. However, deep imputation architectures are difficult to design and tune for those without rich knowledge of deep neural networks and scRNA-seq. Therefore, Surrogate-assisted Evolutionary Deep Imputation Model (SEDIM) is proposed to automatically design the architectures of deep neural networks for imputing gene expression levels in scRNA-seq data without any manual tuning. Moreover, the proposed SEDIM constructs an offline surrogate model, which can accelerate the computational efficiency of the architectural search. Comprehensive studies show that SEDIM significantly improves the imputation and clustering performance compared with other benchmark methods. In addition, we also extensively explore the performance of SEDIM in other contexts and platforms including mass cytometry and metabolic profiling in a comprehensive manner. Marker gene detection, gene ontology enrichment and pathological analysis are conducted to provide novel insights into cell-type identification and the underlying mechanisms. The source code is available at https://github.com/li-shaochuan/SEDIM.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
35018408	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	A robust and scalable graph neural network for accurate single-cell classification.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) techniques provide high-resolution data on cellular heterogeneity in diverse tissues, and a critical step for the data analysis is cell type identification. Traditional methods usually cluster the cells and manually identify cell clusters through marker genes, which is time-consuming and subjective. With the launch of several large-scale single-cell projects, millions of sequenced cells have been annotated and it is promising to transfer labels from the annotated datasets to newly generated datasets. One powerful way for the transferring is to learn cell relations through the graph neural network (GNN), but traditional GNNs are difficult to process millions of cells due to the expensive costs of the message-passing procedure at each training epoch. Here, we have developed a robust and scalable GNN-based method for accurate single-cell classification (GraphCS), where the graph is constructed to connect similar cells within and between labelled and unlabeled scRNA-seq datasets for propagation of shared information. To overcome the slow information propagation of GNN at each training epoch, the diffused information is pre-calculated via the approximate Generalized PageRank algorithm, enabling sublinear complexity over cell numbers. Compared with existing methods, GraphCS demonstrates better performance on simulated, cross-platform, cross-species and cross-omics scRNA-seq datasets. More importantly, our model provides a high speed and scalability on large datasets, and can achieve superior performance for 1 million cells within 50 min.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
35302164	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	Learning deep features and topological structure of cells for clustering of scRNA-sequencing data.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) measures gene transcriptome at the cell level, paving the way for the identification of cell subpopulations. Although deep learning has been successfully applied to scRNA-seq data, these algorithms are criticized for the undesirable performance and interpretability of patterns because of the noises, high-dimensionality and extraordinary sparsity of scRNA-seq data. To address these issues, a novel deep learning subspace clustering algorithm (aka scGDC) for cell types in scRNA-seq data is proposed, which simultaneously learns the deep features and topological structure of cells. Specifically, scGDC extends auto-encoder by introducing a self-representation layer to extract deep features of cells, and learns affinity graph of cells, which provide a better and more comprehensive strategy to characterize structure of cell types. To address heterogeneity of scRNA-seq data, scGDC projects cells of various types onto different subspaces, where types, particularly rare cell types, are well discriminated by utilizing generative adversarial learning. Furthermore, scGDC joins deep feature extraction, structural learning and cell type discovery, where features of cells are extracted under the guidance of cell types, thereby improving performance of algorithms. A total of 15 scRNA-seq datasets from various tissues and organisms with the number of cells ranging from 56 to 63 103 are adopted to validate performance of algorithms, and experimental results demonstrate that scGDC significantly outperforms 14 state-of-the-art methods in terms of various measurements (on average 25.51% by improvement), where (rare) cell types are significantly associated with topology of affinity graph of cells. The proposed model and algorithm provide an effective strategy for the analysis of scRNA-seq data (The software is coded using python, and is freely available for academic https://github.com/xkmaxidian/scGDC).	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
36242564	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	ICSDA: a multi-modal deep learning model to predict breast cancer recurrence and metastasis risk by integrating pathological, clinical and gene expression data.	Breast cancer patients often have recurrence and metastasis after surgery. Predicting the risk of recurrence and metastasis for a breast cancer patient is essential for the development of precision treatment. In this study, we proposed a novel multi-modal deep learning prediction model by integrating hematoxylin & eosin (H&E)-stained histopathological images, clinical information and gene expression data. Specifically, we segmented tumor regions in H&E into image blocks (256 x 256 pixels) and encoded each image block into a 1D feature vector using a deep neural network. Then, the attention module scored each area of the H&E-stained images and combined image features with clinical and gene expression data to predict the risk of recurrence and metastasis for each patient. To test the model, we downloaded all 196 breast cancer samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas with clinical, gene expression and H&E information simultaneously available. The samples were then divided into the training and testing sets with a ratio of 7: 3, in which the distributions of the samples were kept between the two datasets by hierarchical sampling. The multi-modal model achieved an area-under-the-curve value of 0.75 on the testing set better than those based solely on H&E image, sequencing data and clinical data, respectively. This study might have clinical significance in identifying high-risk breast cancer patients, who may benefit from postoperative adjuvant treatment.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
35581644	2022	Genome biology	Identifying common transcriptome signatures of cancer by interpreting deep learning models.	BACKGROUND: Cancer is a set of diseases characterized by unchecked cell proliferation and invasion of surrounding tissues. The many genes that have been genetically associated with cancer or shown to directly contribute to oncogenesis vary widely between tumor types, but common gene signatures that relate to core cancer pathways have also been identified. It is not clear, however, whether there exist additional sets of genes or transcriptomic features that are less well known in cancer biology but that are also commonly deregulated across several cancer types. RESULTS: Here, we agnostically identify transcriptomic features that are commonly shared between cancer types using 13,461 RNA-seq samples from 19 normal tissue types and 18 solid tumor types to train three feed-forward neural networks, based either on protein-coding gene expression, lncRNA expression, or splice junction use, to distinguish between normal and tumor samples. All three models recognize transcriptome signatures that are consistent across tumors. Analysis of attribution values extracted from our models reveals that genes that are commonly altered in cancer by expression or splicing variations are under strong evolutionary and selective constraints. Importantly, we find that genes composing our cancer transcriptome signatures are not frequently affected by mutations or genomic alterations and that their functions differ widely from the genes genetically associated with cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlighted that deregulation of RNA-processing genes and aberrant splicing are pervasive features on which core cancer pathways might converge across a large array of solid tumor types.

35761403	2022	Genome biology	scDART: integrating unmatched scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data and learning cross-modality relationship simultaneously.	It is a challenging task to integrate scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data obtained from different batches. Existing methods tend to use a pre-defined gene activity matrix to convert the scATAC-seq data into scRNA-seq data. The pre-defined gene activity matrix is often of low quality and does not reflect the dataset-specific relationship between the two data modalities. We propose scDART, a deep learning framework that integrates scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data and learns cross-modalities relationships simultaneously. Specifically, the design of scDART allows it to preserve cell trajectories in continuous cell populations and can be applied to trajectory inference on integrated data.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
35022082	2022	Genome biology	A deep generative model for multi-view profiling of single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data.

DeepLinc demonstrates high efficiency in learning from imperfect and incomplete spatial transcriptome data, filtering false interactions, and imputing missing distal and proximal interactions. The latent representations learned by DeepLinc are also used for inferring the signature genes contributing to the cell interaction landscapes, and for reclustering the cells based on the spatially coded cell heterogeneity in complex tissues at single-cell resolution.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
36198490	2022	Genome research	A model-based constrained deep learning clustering approach for spatially resolved single-cell data.	Spatially resolved scRNA-seq (sp-scRNA-seq) technologies provide the potential to comprehensively profile gene expression patterns in tissue context. However, the development of computational methods lags behind the advances in these technologies, which limits the fulfillment of their potential. In this study, we develop a deep learning approach for clustering sp-scRNA-seq data, named Deep Spatially constrained Single-cell Clustering (DSSC). In this model, we integrate the spatial information of cells into the clustering process in two steps: (1) the spatial information is encoded by using a graphical neural network model, and (2) cell-to-cell constraints are built based on the spatial expression pattern of the marker genes and added in the model to guide the clustering process. Then, a deep embedding clustering is performed on the bottleneck layer of autoencoder by Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence along with the learning of feature representation. DSSC is the first model that can use information from both spatial coordinates and marker genes to guide cell/spot clustering. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real data sets show that DSSC boosts clustering performance significantly compared with the state-of-the-art methods. It has robust performance across different data sets with various cell type/tissue organization and/or cell type/tissue spatial dependency. We conclude that DSSC is a promising tool for clustering sp-scRNA-seq data.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv

36155798	2022	Nucleic acids research	Geographic encoding of transcripts enabled high-accuracy and isoform-aware deep learning of RNA methylation.	As the most pervasive epigenetic mark present on mRNA and lncRNA, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA methylation regulates all stages of RNA life in various biological processes and disease mechanisms. Computational methods for deciphering RNA modification have achieved great success in recent years; nevertheless, their potential remains underexploited. One reason for this is that existing models usually consider only the sequence of transcripts, ignoring the various regions (or geography) of transcripts such as 3'UTR and intron, where the epigenetic mark forms and functions. Here, we developed three simple yet powerful encoding schemes for transcripts to capture the submolecular geographic information of RNA, which is largely independent from sequences. We show that m6A prediction models based on geographic information alone can achieve comparable performances to classic sequence-based methods. Importantly, geographic information substantially enhances the accuracy of sequence-based models, enables isoform- and tissue-specific prediction of m6A sites, and improves m6A signal detection from direct RNA sequencing data. The geographic encoding schemes we developed have exhibited strong interpretability, and are applicable to not only m6A but also N1-methyladenosine (m1A), and can serve as a general and effective complement to the widely used sequence encoding schemes in deep learning applications concerning RNA transcripts.

35524568	2022	Nucleic acids research	scIMC: a platform for benchmarking comparison and visualization analysis of scRNA-seq data imputation methods.	With the advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), one major challenging is the so-called 'dropout' events that distort gene expression and remarkably influence downstream analysis in single-cell transcriptome. To address this issue, much effort has been done and several scRNA-seq imputation methods were developed with two categories: model-based and deep learning-based. However, comprehensively and systematically comparing existing methods are still lacking. In this work, we use six simulated and two real scRNA-seq datasets to comprehensively evaluate and compare a total of 12 available imputation methods from the following four aspects: (i) gene expression recovering, (ii) cell clustering, (iii) gene differential expression, and (iv) cellular trajectory reconstruction. We demonstrate that deep learning-based approaches generally exhibit better overall performance than model-based approaches under major benchmarking comparison, indicating the power of deep learning for imputation. Importantly, we built scIMC (single-cell Imputation Methods Comparison platform), the first online platform that integrates all available state-of-the-art imputation methods for benchmarking comparison and visualization analysis, which is expected to be a convenient and useful tool for researchers of interest. It is now freely accessible via https://server.wei-group.net/scIMC/.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
34871454	2022	Nucleic acids research	Effective and scalable single-cell data alignment with non-linear canonical correlation analysis.	Data alignment is one of the first key steps in single cell analysis for integrating multiple datasets and performing joint analysis across studies. Data alignment is challenging in extremely large datasets, however, as the major of the current single cell data alignment methods are not computationally efficient. Here, we present VIPCCA, a computational framework based on non-linear canonical correlation analysis for effective and scalable single cell data alignment. VIPCCA leverages both deep learning for effective single cell data modeling and variational inference for scalable computation, thus enabling powerful data alignment across multiple samples, multiple data platforms, and multiple data types. VIPCCA is accurate for a range of alignment tasks including alignment between single cell RNAseq and ATACseq datasets and can easily accommodate millions of cells, thereby providing researchers unique opportunities to tackle challenges emerging from large-scale single-cell atlas.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
36250636	2022	Nucleic acids research	DeepST: identifying spatial domains in spatial transcriptomics by deep learning.	Recent advances in spatial transcriptomics (ST) have brought unprecedented opportunities to understand tissue organization and function in spatial context. However, it is still challenging to precisely dissect spatial domains with similar gene expression and histology in situ. Here, we present DeepST, an accurate and universal deep learning framework to identify spatial domains, which performs better than the existing state-of-the-art methods on benchmarking datasets of the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Further testing on a breast cancer ST dataset, we showed that DeepST can dissect spatial domains in cancer tissue at a finer scale. Moreover, DeepST can achieve not only effective batch integration of ST data generated from multiple batches or different technologies, but also expandable capabilities for processing other spatial omics data. Together, our results demonstrate that DeepST has the exceptional capacity for identifying spatial domains, making it a desirable tool to gain novel insights from ST studies.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
35048973	2022	Nucleic acids research	Variational autoencoding of gene landscapes during mouse CNS development uncovers layered roles of Polycomb Repressor Complex 2.	A prominent aspect of most, if not all, central nervous systems (CNSs) is that anterior regions (brain) are larger than posterior ones (spinal cord). Studies in Drosophila and mouse have revealed that Polycomb Repressor Complex 2 (PRC2), a protein complex responsible for applying key repressive histone modifications, acts by several mechanisms to promote anterior CNS expansion. However, it is unclear what the full spectrum of PRC2 action is during embryonic CNS development and how PRC2 intersects with the epigenetic landscape. We removed PRC2 function from the developing mouse CNS, by mutating the key gene Eed, and generated spatio-temporal transcriptomic data. To decode the role of PRC2, we developed a method that incorporates standard statistical analyses with probabilistic deep learning to integrate the transcriptomic response to PRC2 inactivation with epigenetic data. This multi-variate analysis corroborates the central involvement of PRC2 in anterior CNS expansion, and also identifies several unanticipated cohorts of genes, such as proliferation and immune response genes. Furthermore, the analysis reveals specific profiles of regulation via PRC2 upon these gene cohorts. These findings uncover a differential logic for the role of PRC2 upon functionally distinct gene cohorts that drive CNS anterior expansion. To support the analysis of emerging multi-modal datasets, we provide a novel bioinformatics package that integrates transcriptomic and epigenetic datasets to identify regulatory underpinnings of heterogeneous biological processes.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
35404970	2022	PLoS computational biology	DGCyTOF: Deep learning with graphic cluster visualization to predict cell types of single cell mass cytometry data.	Single-cell mass cytometry, also known as cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF) is a powerful high-throughput technology that allows analysis of up to 50 protein markers per cell for the quantification and classification of single cells. Traditional manual gating utilized to identify new cell populations has been inadequate, inefficient, unreliable, and difficult to use, and no algorithms to identify both calibration and new cell populations has been well established. A deep learning with graphic cluster (DGCyTOF) visualization is developed as a new integrated embedding visualization approach in identifying canonical and new cell types. The DGCyTOF combines deep-learning classification and hierarchical stable-clustering methods to sequentially build a tri-layer construct for known cell types and the identification of new cell types. First, deep classification learning is constructed to distinguish calibration cell populations from all cells by softmax classification assignment under a probability threshold, and graph embedding clustering is then used to identify new cell populations sequentially. In the middle of two-layer, cell labels are automatically adjusted between new and unknown cell populations via a feedback loop using an iteration calibration system to reduce the rate of error in the identification of cell types, and a 3-dimensional (3D) visualization platform is finally developed to display the cell clusters with all cell-population types annotated. Utilizing two benchmark CyTOF databases comprising up to 43 million cells, we compared accuracy and speed in the identification of cell types among DGCyTOF, DeepCyTOF, and other technologies including dimension reduction with clustering, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Factor Analysis (FA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Isometric Feature Mapping (Isomap), t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) with k-means clustering and Gaussian mixture clustering. We observed the DGCyTOF represents a robust complete learning system with high accuracy, speed and visualization by eight measurement criteria. The DGCyTOF displayed F-scores of 0.9921 for CyTOF1 and 0.9992 for CyTOF2 datasets, whereas those scores were only 0.507 and 0.529 for the t-SNE+k-means; 0.565 and 0.59, for UMAP+ k-means. Comparison of DGCyTOF with t-SNE and UMAP visualization in accuracy demonstrated its approximately 35% superiority in predicting cell types. In addition, observation of cell-population distribution was more intuitive in the 3D visualization in DGCyTOF than t-SNE and UMAP visualization. The DGCyTOF model can automatically assign known labels to single cells with high accuracy using deep-learning classification assembling with traditional graph-clustering and dimension-reduction strategies. Guided by a calibration system, the model seeks optimal accuracy balance among calibration cell populations and unknown cell types, yielding a complete and robust learning system that is highly accurate in the identification of cell populations compared to results using other methods in the analysis of single-cell CyTOF data. Application of the DGCyTOF method to identify cell populations could be extended to the analysis of single-cell RNASeq data and other omics data.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
35081109	2022	PLoS computational biology	AIME: Autoencoder-based integrative multi-omics data embedding that allows for confounder adjustments.	In the integrative analyses of omics data, it is often of interest to extract data representation from one data type that best reflect its relations with another data type. This task is traditionally fulfilled by linear methods such as canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and partial least squares (PLS). However, information contained in one data type pertaining to the other data type may be complex and in nonlinear form. Deep learning provides a convenient alternative to extract low-dimensional nonlinear data embedding. In addition, the deep learning setup can naturally incorporate the effects of clinical confounding factors into the integrative analysis. Here we report a deep learning setup, named Autoencoder-based Integrative Multi-omics data Embedding (AIME), to extract data representation for omics data integrative analysis. The method can adjust for confounder variables, achieve informative data embedding, rank features in terms of their contributions, and find pairs of features from the two data types that are related to each other through the data embedding. In simulation studies, the method was highly effective in the extraction of major contributing features between data types. Using two real microRNA-gene expression datasets, one with confounder variables and one without, we show that AIME excluded the influence of confounders, and extracted biologically plausible novel information. The R package based on Keras and the TensorFlow backend is available at https://github.com/tianwei-yu/AIME.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
37387181	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	GAN-based data augmentation for transcriptomics: survey and comparative assessment.	MOTIVATION: Transcriptomics data are becoming more accessible due to high-throughput and less costly sequencing methods. However, data scarcity prevents exploiting deep learning models' full predictive power for phenotypes prediction. Artificially enhancing the training sets, namely data augmentation, is suggested as a regularization strategy. Data augmentation corresponds to label-invariant transformations of the training set (e.g. geometric transformations on images and syntax parsing on text data). Such transformations are, unfortunately, unknown in the transcriptomic field. Therefore, deep generative models such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been proposed to generate additional samples. In this article, we analyze GAN-based data augmentation strategies with respect to performance indicators and the classification of cancer phenotypes. RESULTS: This work highlights a significant boost in binary and multiclass classification performances due to augmentation strategies. Without augmentation, training a classifier on only 50 RNA-seq samples yields an accuracy of, respectively, 94% and 70% for binary and tissue classification. In comparison, we achieved 98% and 94% of accuracy when adding 1000 augmented samples. Richer architectures and more expensive training of the GAN return better augmentation performances and generated data quality overall. Further analysis of the generated data shows that several performance indicators are needed to assess its quality correctly. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: All data used for this research are publicly available and comes from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Reproducible code is available on the GitLab repository: https://forge.ibisc.univ-evry.fr/alacan/GANs-for-transcriptomics.	RNA-seq_records.filtered.tsv
37561107	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	BEENE: deep learning-based nonlinear embedding improves batch effect estimation.	MOTIVATION: Analyzing large-scale single-cell transcriptomic datasets generated using different technologies is challenging due to the presence of batch-specific systematic variations known as batch effects. Since biological and technological differences are often interspersed, detecting and accounting for batch effects in RNA-seq datasets are critical for effective data integration and interpretation. Low-dimensional embeddings, such as principal component analysis (PCA) are widely used in visual inspection and estimation of batch effects. Linear dimensionality reduction methods like PCA are effective in assessing the presence of batch effects, especially when batch effects exhibit linear patterns. However, batch effects are inherently complex and existing linear dimensionality reduction methods could be inadequate and imprecise in the presence of sophisticated nonlinear batch effects. RESULTS: We present Batch Effect Estimation using Nonlinear Embedding (BEENE), a deep nonlinear auto-encoder network which is specially tailored to generate an alternative lower dimensional embedding suitable for both linear and nonlinear batch effects. BEENE simultaneously learns the batch and biological variables from RNA-seq data, resulting in an embedding that is more robust and sensitive than PCA embedding in terms of detecting and quantifying batch effects. BEENE was assessed on a collection of carefully controlled simulated datasets as well as biological datasets, including two technical replicates of mouse embryogenesis cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from three largely different experiments and five studies of pancreatic islet cells. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: BEENE is freely available as an open source project at https://github.com/ashiq24/BEENE.	RNA-seq_records.filtered.tsv
37294799	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	DeepITEH: a deep learning framework for identifying tissue-specific eRNAs from the human genome.	MOTIVATION: Enhancers are vital cis-regulatory elements that regulate gene expression. Enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), a type of long noncoding RNAs, are transcribed from enhancer regions in the genome. The tissue-specific expression of eRNAs is crucial in the regulation of gene expression and cancer development. The methods that identify eRNAs based solely on genomic sequence data have high error rates because they do not account for tissue specificity. Specific histone modifications associated with eRNAs offer valuable information for their identification. However, identification of eRNAs using histone modification data requires the use of both RNA-seq and histone modification data. Unfortunately, many public datasets contain only one of these components, which impedes the accurate identification of eRNAs. RESULTS: We introduce DeepITEH, a deep learning framework that leverages RNA-seq data and histone modification data from multiple samples of the same tissue to enhance the accuracy of identifying eRNAs. Specifically, deepITEH initially categorizes eRNAs into two classes, namely, regularly expressed eRNAs and accidental eRNAs, using histone modification data from multiple samples of the same tissue. Thereafter, it integrates both sequence and histone modification features to identify eRNAs in specific tissues. To evaluate the performance of DeepITEH, we compared it with four existing state-of-the-art enhancer prediction methods, SeqPose, iEnhancer-RD, LSTMAtt, and FRL, on four normal tissues and four cancer tissues. Remarkably, seven of these tissues demonstrated a substantially improved specific eRNA prediction performance with DeepITEH, when compared with other methods. Our findings suggest that DeepITEH can effectively predict potential eRNAs on the human genome, providing insights for studying the eRNA function in cancer. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code and dataset of DeepITEH have been uploaded to https://github.com/lyli1013/DeepITEH.	RNA-seq_records.filtered.tsv
37004161	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	STGRNS: an interpretable transformer-based method for inferring gene regulatory networks from single-cell transcriptomic data.	"MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies provide an opportunity to infer cell-specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs), which is an important challenge in systems biology. Although numerous methods have been developed for inferring GRNs from scRNA-seq data, it is still a challenge to deal with cellular heterogeneity. RESULTS: To address this challenge, we developed an interpretable transformer-based method namely STGRNS for inferring GRNs from scRNA-seq data. In this algorithm, gene expression motif technique was proposed to convert gene pairs into contiguous sub-vectors, which can be used as input for the transformer encoder. By avoiding missing phase-specific regulations in a network, gene expression motif can improve the accuracy of GRN inference for different types of scRNA-seq data. To assess the performance of STGRNS, we implemented the comparative experiments with some popular methods on extensive benchmark datasets including 21 static and 27 time-series scRNA-seq dataset. All the results show that STGRNS is superior to other comparative methods. In addition, STGRNS was also proved to be more interpretable than ""black box"" deep learning methods, which are well-known for the difficulty to explain the predictions clearly.

37267208	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Consensus label propagation with graph convolutional networks for single-cell RNA sequencing cell type annotation.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, annotated by cell type, is useful in a variety of downstream biological applications, such as profiling gene expression at the single-cell level. However, manually assigning these annotations with known marker genes is both time-consuming and subjective. RESULTS: We present a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)-based approach to automate the annotation process. Our process builds upon existing labeling approaches, using state-of-the-art tools to find cells with highly confident label assignments through consensus and spreading these confident labels with a semi-supervised GCN. Using simulated data and two scRNA-seq datasets from different tissues, we show that our method improves accuracy over a simple consensus algorithm and the average of the underlying tools. We also compare our method to a nonparametric neighbor majority approach, showing comparable results. We then demonstrate that our GCN method allows for feature interpretation, identifying important genes for cell type classification. We present our completed pipeline, written in PyTorch, as an end-to-end tool for automating and interpreting the classification of scRNA-seq data.

37540223	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	ProtoCell4P: an explainable prototype-based neural network for patient classification using single-cell RNA-seq.	MOTIVATION: The rapid advance in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology over the past decade has provided a rich resource of gene expression profiles of single cells measured on patients, facilitating the study of many biological questions at the single-cell level. One intriguing research is to study the single cells which play critical roles in the phenotypes of patients, which has the potential to identify those cells and genes driving the disease phenotypes. To this end, deep learning models are expected to well encode the single-cell information and achieve precise prediction of patients' phenotypes using scRNA-seq data. However, we are facing critical challenges in designing deep learning models for classifying patient samples due to (i) the samples collected in the same dataset contain a variable number of cells-some samples might only have hundreds of cells sequenced while others could have thousands of cells, and (ii) the number of samples available is typically small and the expression profile of each cell is noisy and extremely high-dimensional. Moreover, the black-box nature of existing deep learning models makes it difficult for the researchers to interpret the models and extract useful knowledge from them. RESULTS: We propose a prototype-based and cell-informed model for patient phenotype classification, termed ProtoCell4P, that can alleviate problems of the sample scarcity and the diverse number of cells by leveraging the cell knowledge with representatives of cells (called prototypes), and precisely classify the patients by adaptively incorporating information from different cells. Moreover, this classification process can be explicitly interpreted by identifying the key cells for decision making and by further summarizing the knowledge of cell types to unravel the biological nature of the classification. Our approach is explainable at the single-cell resolution which can identify the key cells in each patient's classification. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can effectively deal with patient classifications using single-cell data and outperforms the existing approaches. Furthermore, our approach is able to uncover the association between cell types and biological classes of interest from a data-driven perspective.

36821425	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	CLAIRE: contrastive learning-based batch correction framework for better balance between batch mixing and preservation of cellular heterogeneity.	MOTIVATION: Integration of growing single-cell RNA sequencing datasets helps better understand cellular identity and function. The major challenge for integration is removing batch effects while preserving biological heterogeneities. Advances in contrastive learning have inspired several contrastive learning-based batch correction methods. However, existing contrastive-learning-based methods exhibit noticeable ad hoc trade-off between batch mixing and preservation of cellular heterogeneities (mix-heterogeneity trade-off). Therefore, a deliberate mix-heterogeneity trade-off is expected to yield considerable improvements in scRNA-seq dataset integration. RESULTS: We develop a novel contrastive learning-based batch correction framework, CIAIRE, which achieves superior mix-heterogeneity trade-off. The key contributions of CLAIRE are proposal of two complementary strategies: construction strategy and refinement strategy, to improve the appropriateness of positive pairs. Construction strategy dynamically generates positive pairs by augmenting inter-batch mutual nearest neighbors (MNN) with intra-batch k-nearest neighbors (KNN), which improves the coverage of positive pairs for the whole distribution of shared cell types between batches. Refinement strategy aims to automatically reduce the potential false positive pairs from the construction strategy, which resorts to the memory effect of deep neural networks. We demonstrate that CLAIRE possesses superior mix-heterogeneity trade-off over existing contrastive learning-based methods. Benchmark results on six real datasets also show that CLAIRE achieves the best integration performance against eight state-of-the-art methods. Finally, comprehensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of CLAIRE.

37233193	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Deep single-cell RNA-seq data clustering with graph prototypical contrastive learning.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing enables researchers to study cellular heterogeneity at single-cell level. To this end, identifying cell types of cells with clustering techniques becomes an important task for downstream analysis. However, challenges of scRNA-seq data such as pervasive dropout phenomena hinder obtaining robust clustering outputs. Although existing studies try to alleviate these problems, they fall short of fully leveraging the relationship information and mainly rely on reconstruction-based losses that highly depend on the data quality, which is sometimes noisy. RESULTS: This work proposes a graph-based prototypical contrastive learning method, named scGPCL. Specifically, scGPCL encodes the cell representations using Graph Neural Networks on cell-gene graph that captures the relational information inherent in scRNA-seq data and introduces prototypical contrastive learning to learn cell representations by pushing apart semantically dissimilar pairs and pulling together similar ones. Through extensive experiments on both simulated and real scRNA-seq data, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of scGPCL.

37740953	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	DeepCCI: a deep learning framework for identifying cell-cell interactions from single-cell RNA sequencing data.	MOTIVATION: Cell-cell interactions (CCIs) play critical roles in many biological processes such as cellular differentiation, tissue homeostasis, and immune response. With the rapid development of high throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies, it is of high importance to identify CCIs from the ever-increasing scRNA-seq data. However, limited by the algorithmic constraints, current computational methods based on statistical strategies ignore some key latent information contained in scRNA-seq data with high sparsity and heterogeneity. RESULTS: Here, we developed a deep learning framework named DeepCCI to identify meaningful CCIs from scRNA-seq data. Applications of DeepCCI to a wide range of publicly available datasets from diverse technologies and platforms demonstrate its ability to predict significant CCIs accurately and effectively. Powered by the flexible and easy-to-use software, DeepCCI can provide the one-stop solution to discover meaningful intercellular interactions and build CCI networks from scRNA-seq data.

MOTIVATION: Since the development of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies, clustering analysis of single-cell gene expression data has been an essential tool for distinguishing cell types and identifying novel cell types. Even though many methods have been available for scRNA-seq clustering analysis, the majority of them are constrained by the requirement on predetermined cluster numbers or the dependence on selected initial cluster assignment. RESULTS: In this article, we propose an adaptive embedding and clustering method named scAce, which constructs a variational autoencoder to simultaneously learn cell embeddings and cluster assignments. In the scAce method, we develop an adaptive cluster merging approach which achieves improved clustering results without the need to estimate the number of clusters in advance. In addition, scAce provides an option to perform clustering enhancement, which can update and enhance cluster assignments based on previous clustering results from other methods. Based on computational analysis of both simulated and real datasets, we demonstrate that scAce outperforms state-of-the-art clustering methods for scRNA-seq data, and achieves better clustering accuracy and robustness.

MOTIVATION: In single-cell transcriptomics applications, effective identification of cell types in multicellular organisms and in-depth study of the relationships between genes has become one of the main goals of bioinformatics research. However, data heterogeneity and random noise pose significant difficulties for scRNA-seq data analysis. RESULTS: We have proposed an adversarial dense graph convolutional network architecture for single-cell classification. Specifically, to enhance the representation of higher-order features and the organic combination between features, dense connectivity mechanism and attention-based feature aggregation are introduced for feature learning in convolutional neural networks. To preserve the features of the original data, we use a feature reconstruction module to assist the goal of single-cell classification.

37387180	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	CLARIFY: cell-cell interaction and gene regulatory network refinement from spatially resolved transcriptomics.	MOTIVATION: Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in a cell provide the tight feedback needed to synchronize cell actions. However, genes in a cell also take input from, and provide signals to other neighboring cells. These cell-cell interactions (CCIs) and the GRNs deeply influence each other. Many computational methods have been developed for GRN inference in cells. More recently, methods were proposed to infer CCIs using single cell gene expression data with or without cell spatial location information. However, in reality, the two processes do not exist in isolation and are subject to spatial constraints. Despite this rationale, no methods currently exist to infer GRNs and CCIs using the same model. RESULTS: We propose CLARIFY, a tool that takes GRNs as input, uses them and spatially resolved gene expression data to infer CCIs, while simultaneously outputting refined cell-specific GRNs. CLARIFY uses a novel multi-level graph autoencoder, which mimics cellular networks at a higher level and cell-specific GRNs at a deeper level. We applied CLARIFY to two real spatial transcriptomic datasets, one using seqFISH and the other using MERFISH, and also tested on simulated datasets from scMultiSim. We compared the quality of predicted GRNs and CCIs with state-of-the-art baseline methods that inferred either only GRNs or only CCIs. The results show that CLARIFY consistently outperforms the baseline in terms of commonly used evaluation metrics. Our results point to the importance of co-inference of CCIs and GRNs and to the use of layered graph neural networks as an inference tool for biological networks.

37669132	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Multimodal learning of noncoding variant effects using genome sequence and chromatin structure.	"MOTIVATION: A growing amount of noncoding genetic variants, including single-nucleotide polymorphisms, are found to be associated with complex human traits and diseases. Their mechanistic interpretation is relatively limited and can use the help from computational prediction of their effects on epigenetic profiles. However, current models often focus on local, 1D genome sequence determinants and disregard global, 3D chromatin structure that critically affects epigenetic events. RESULTS: We find that noncoding variants of unexpected high similarity in epigenetic profiles, with regards to their relatively low similarity in local sequences, can be largely attributed to their proximity in chromatin structure. Accordingly, we have developed a multimodal deep learning scheme that incorporates both data of 1D genome sequence and 3D chromatin structure for predicting noncoding variant effects. Specifically, we have integrated convolutional and recurrent neural networks for sequence embedding and graph neural networks for structure embedding despite the resolution gap between the two types of data, while utilizing recent DNA language models. Numerical results show that our models outperform competing sequence-only models in predicting epigenetic profiles and their use of long-range interactions complement sequence-only models in extracting regulatory motifs. They prove to be excellent predictors for noncoding variant effects in gene expression and pathogenicity, whether in unsupervised ""zero-shot"" learning or supervised ""few-shot"" learning.

MOTIVATION: Recent rapid developments in spatial transcriptomic techniques at cellular resolution have gained increasing attention. However, the unique characteristics of large-scale cellular resolution spatial transcriptomic datasets, such as the limited number of transcripts captured per spot and the vast number of spots, pose significant challenges to current cell-type deconvolution methods. RESULTS: In this study, we introduce stVAE, a method based on the variational autoencoder framework to deconvolve the cell-type composition of cellular resolution spatial transcriptomic datasets. To assess the performance of stVAE, we apply it to five datasets across three different biological tissues. In the Stereo-seq and Slide-seqV2 datasets of the mouse brain, stVAE accurately reconstructs the laminar structure of the pyramidal cell layers in the cortex, which are mainly organized by the subtypes of telencephalon projecting excitatory neurons. In the Stereo-seq dataset of the E12.5 mouse embryo, stVAE resolves the complex spatial patterns of osteoblast subtypes, which are supported by their marker genes. In Stereo-seq and Pixel-seq datasets of the mouse olfactory bulb, stVAE accurately delineates the spatial distributions of known cell types. In summary, stVAE can accurately identify spatial patterns of cell types and their relative proportions across spots for cellular resolution spatial transcriptomic data. It is instrumental in understanding the heterogeneity of cell populations and their interactions within tissues.

MOTIVATION: Recent advances in multimodal single-cell omics technologies enable multiple modalities of molecular attributes, such as gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and protein abundance, to be profiled simultaneously at a global level in individual cells. While the increasing availability of multiple data modalities is expected to provide a more accurate clustering and characterization of cells, the development of computational methods that are capable of extracting information embedded across data modalities is still in its infancy. RESULTS: We propose SnapCCESS for clustering cells by integrating data modalities in multimodal single-cell omics data using an unsupervised ensemble deep learning framework. By creating snapshots of embeddings of multimodality using variational autoencoders, SnapCCESS can be coupled with various clustering algorithms for generating consensus clustering of cells. We applied SnapCCESS with several clustering algorithms to various datasets generated from popular multimodal single-cell omics technologies. Our results demonstrate that SnapCCESS is effective and more efficient than conventional ensemble deep learning-based clustering methods and outperforms other state-of-the-art multimodal embedding generation methods in integrating data modalities for clustering cells. The improved clustering of cells from SnapCCESS will pave the way for more accurate characterization of cell identity and types, an essential step for various downstream analyses of multimodal single-cell omics data.

37379157	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	MDTips: a multimodal-data-based drug-target interaction prediction system fusing knowledge, gene expression profile, and structural data.	MOTIVATION: Screening new drug-target interactions (DTIs) by traditional experimental methods is costly and time-consuming. Recent advances in knowledge graphs, chemical linear notations, and genomic data enable researchers to develop computational-based-DTI models, which play a pivotal role in drug repurposing and discovery. However, there still needs to develop a multimodal fusion DTI model that integrates available heterogeneous data into a unified framework. RESULTS: We developed MDTips, a multimodal-data-based DTI prediction system, by fusing the knowledge graphs, gene expression profiles, and structural information of drugs/targets. MDTips yielded accurate and robust performance on DTI predictions. We found that multimodal fusion learning can fully consider the importance of each modality and incorporate information from multiple aspects, thus improving model performance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that deep learning-based encoders (i.e. Attentive FP and Transformer) outperform traditional chemical descriptors/fingerprints, and MDTips outperforms other state-of-the-art prediction models.

37522887	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	FGCNSurv: dually fused graph convolutional network for multi-omics survival prediction.	MOTIVATION: Survival analysis is an important tool for modeling time-to-event data, e.g. to predict the survival time of patient after a cancer diagnosis or a certain treatment. While deep neural networks work well in standard prediction tasks, it is still unclear how to best utilize these deep models in survival analysis due to the difficulty of modeling right censored data, especially for multi-omics data. Although existing methods have shown the advantage of multi-omics integration in survival prediction, it remains challenging to extract complementary information from different omics and improve the prediction accuracy. RESULTS: In this work, we propose a novel multi-omics deep survival prediction approach by dually fused graph convolutional network (GCN) named FGCNSurv. Our FGCNSurv is a complete generative model from multi-omics data to survival outcome of patients, including feature fusion by a factorized bilinear model, graph fusion of multiple graphs, higher-level feature extraction by GCN and survival prediction by a Cox proportional hazard model. The factorized bilinear model enables to capture cross-omics features and quantify complex relations from multi-omics data. By fusing single-omics features and the cross-omics features, and simultaneously fusing multiple graphs from different omics, GCN with the generated dually fused graph could capture higher-level features for computing the survival loss in the Cox-PH model. Comprehensive experimental results on real-world datasets with gene expression and microRNA expression data show that the proposed FGCNSurv method outperforms existing survival prediction methods, and imply its ability to extract complementary information for survival prediction from multi-omics data.

36864611	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Interpretable meta-learning of multi-omics data for survival analysis and pathway enrichment.	MOTIVATION: Despite the success of recent machine learning algorithms' applications to survival analysis, their black-box nature hinders interpretability, which is arguably the most important aspect. Similarly, multi-omics data integration for survival analysis is often constrained by the underlying relationships and correlations that are rarely well understood. The goal of this work is to alleviate the interpretability problem in machine learning approaches for survival analysis and also demonstrate how multi-omics data integration improves survival analysis and pathway enrichment. We use meta-learning, a machine-learning algorithm that is trained on a variety of related datasets and allows quick adaptations to new tasks, to perform survival analysis and pathway enrichment on pan-cancer datasets. In recent machine learning research, meta-learning has been effectively used for knowledge transfer among multiple related datasets. RESULTS: We use meta-learning with Cox hazard loss to show that the integration of TCGA pan-cancer data increases the performance of survival analysis. We also apply advanced model interpretability method called DeepLIFT (Deep Learning Important FeaTures) to show different sets of enriched pathways for multi-omics and transcriptomics data. Our results show that multi-omics cancer survival analysis enhances performance compared with using transcriptomics or clinical data alone. Additionally, we show a correlation between variable importance assignment from DeepLIFT and gene coenrichment, suggesting that genes with higher and similar contribution scores are more likely to be enriched together in the same enrichment sets.

37740295	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	GOAT: Gene-level biomarker discovery from multi-Omics data using graph ATtention neural network for eosinophilic asthma subtype.	MOTIVATION: Asthma is a heterogeneous disease where various subtypes are established and molecular biomarkers of the subtypes are yet to be discovered. Recent availability of multi-omics data paved a way to discover molecular biomarkers for the subtypes. However, multi-omics biomarker discovery is challenging because of the complex interplay between different omics layers. RESULTS: We propose a deep attention model named Gene-level biomarker discovery from multi-Omics data using graph ATtention neural network (GOAT) for identifying molecular biomarkers for eosinophilic asthma subtypes with multi-omics data. GOAT identifies genes that discriminate subtypes using a graph neural network by modeling complex interactions among genes as the attention mechanism in the deep learning model. In experiments with multi-omics profiles of the COREA (Cohort for Reality and Evolution of Adult Asthma in Korea) asthma cohort of 300 patients, GOAT outperforms existing models and suggests interpretable biological mechanisms underlying asthma subtypes. Importantly, GOAT identified genes that are distinct only in terms of relationship with other genes through attention. To better understand the role of biomarkers, we further investigated two transcription factors, CTNNB1 and JUN, captured by GOAT. We were successful in showing the role of the transcription factors in eosinophilic asthma pathophysiology in a network propagation and transcriptional network analysis, which were not distinct in terms of gene expression level differences.

37833839	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	MSI-XGNN: an explainable GNN computational framework integrating transcription- and methylation-level biomarkers for microsatellite instability detection.	Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a hypermutator phenotype caused by DNA mismatch repair deficiency. MSI has been reported in various human cancers, particularly colorectal, gastric and endometrial cancers. MSI is a promising biomarker for cancer prognosis and immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. Several computational methods have been developed for MSI detection using DNA- or RNA-based approaches based on next-generation sequencing. Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, regulate gene expression and play critical roles in the development and progression of cancer. We here developed MSI-XGNN, a new computational framework for predicting MSI status using bulk RNA-sequencing and DNA methylation data. MSI-XGNN is an explainable deep learning model that combines a graph neural network (GNN) model to extract features from the gene-methylation probe network with a CatBoost model to classify MSI status. MSI-XGNN, which requires tumor-only samples, exhibited comparable performance with two well-known methods that require tumor-normal paired sequencing data, MSIsensor and MANTIS and better performance than several other tools. MSI-XGNN also showed good generalizability on independent validation datasets. MSI-XGNN identified six MSI markers consisting of four methylation probes (EPM2AIP1|MLH1:cg14598950, EPM2AIP1|MLH1:cg27331401, LNP1:cg05428436 and TSC22D2:cg15048832) and two genes (RPL22L1 and MSH4) constituting the optimal feature subset. All six markers were significantly associated with beneficial tumor microenvironment characteristics for immunotherapy, such as tumor mutation burden, neoantigens and immune checkpoint molecules such as programmed cell death-1 and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4. Overall, our study provides a powerful and explainable deep learning model for predicting MSI status and identifying MSI markers that can potentially be used for clinical MSI evaluation.

36567258	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Bubble: a fast single-cell RNA-seq imputation using an autoencoder constrained by bulk RNA-seq data.	Single-cell RNA-sequencing technology (scRNA-seq) brings research to single-cell resolution. However, a major drawback of scRNA-seq is large sparsity, i.e. expressed genes with no reads due to technical noise or limited sequence depth during the scRNA-seq protocol. This phenomenon is also called 'dropout' events, which likely affect downstream analyses such as differential expression analysis, the clustering and visualization of cell subpopulations, cellular trajectory inference, etc. Therefore, there is a need to develop a method to identify and impute these dropout events. We propose Bubble, which first identifies dropout events from all zeros based on expression rate and coefficient of variation of genes within cell subpopulation, and then leverages an autoencoder constrained by bulk RNA-seq data to only impute those values. Unlike other deep learning-based imputation methods, Bubble fuses the matched bulk RNA-seq data as a constraint to reduce the introduction of false positive signals. Using simulated and several real scRNA-seq datasets, we demonstrate that Bubble enhances the recovery of missing values, gene-to-gene and cell-to-cell correlations, and reduces the introduction of false positive signals. Regarding some crucial downstream analyses of scRNA-seq data, Bubble facilitates the identification of differentially expressed genes, improves the performance of clustering and visualization, and aids the construction of cellular trajectory. More importantly, Bubble provides fast and scalable imputation with minimal memory usage.	RNA-seq_records.filtered.tsv
37088976	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Dimensionality reduction and visualization of single-cell RNA-seq data with an improved deep variational autoencoder.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a revolutionary breakthrough that determines the precise gene expressions on individual cells and deciphers cell heterogeneity and subpopulations. However, scRNA-seq data are much noisier than traditional high-throughput RNA-seq data because of technical limitations, leading to many scRNA-seq data studies about dimensionality reduction and visualization remaining at the basic data-stacking stage. In this study, we propose an improved variational autoencoder model (termed DREAM) for dimensionality reduction and a visual analysis of scRNA-seq data. Here, DREAM combines the variational autoencoder and Gaussian mixture model for cell type identification, meanwhile explicitly solving 'dropout' events by introducing the zero-inflated layer to obtain the low-dimensional representation that describes the changes in the original scRNA-seq dataset. Benchmarking comparisons across nine scRNA-seq datasets show that DREAM outperforms four state-of-the-art methods on average. Moreover, we prove that DREAM can accurately capture the expression dynamics of human preimplantation embryonic development. DREAM is implemented in Python, freely available via the GitHub website, https://github.com/Crystal-JJ/DREAM.	RNA-seq_records.filtered.tsv
36907657	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	miWords: transformer-based composite deep learning for highly accurate discovery of pre-miRNA regions across plant genomes.	Discovering pre-microRNAs (miRNAs) is the core of miRNA discovery. Using traditional sequence/structural features, many tools have been published to discover miRNAs. However, in practical applications like genomic annotations, their actual performance has been very low. This becomes more grave in plants where unlike animals pre-miRNAs are much more complex and difficult to identify. A huge gap exists between animals and plants for the available software for miRNA discovery and species-specific miRNA information. Here, we present miWords, a composite deep learning system of transformers and convolutional neural networks which sees genome as a pool of sentences made of words with specific occurrence preferences and contexts, to accurately identify pre-miRNA regions across plant genomes. A comprehensive benchmarking was done involving >10 software representing different genre and many experimentally validated datasets. miWords emerged as the best one while breaching accuracy of 98% and performance lead of ~10%. miWords was also evaluated across Arabidopsis genome where also it outperformed the compared tools. As a demonstration, miWords was run across the tea genome, reporting 803 pre-miRNA regions, all validated by small RNA-seq reads from multiple samples, and most of them were functionally supported by the degradome sequencing data. miWords is freely available as stand-alone source codes at https://scbb.ihbt.res.in/miWords/index.php.

37756593	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	GOWDL: gene ontology-driven wide and deep learning model for cell typing of scRNA-seq data.	Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows for obtaining genomic and transcriptomic profiles of individual cells. That data make it possible to characterize tissues at the cell level. In this context, one of the main analyses exploiting scRNA-seq data is identifying the cell types within tissue to estimate the quantitative composition of cell populations. Due to the massive amount of available scRNA-seq data, automatic classification approaches for cell typing, based on the most recent deep learning technology, are needed. Here, we present the gene ontology-driven wide and deep learning (GOWDL) model for classifying cell types in several tissues. GOWDL implements a hybrid architecture that considers the functional annotations found in Gene Ontology and the marker genes typical of specific cell types. We performed cross-validation and independent external testing, comparing our algorithm with 12 other state-of-the-art predictors. Classification scores demonstrated that GOWDL reached the best results over five different tissues, except for recall, where we got about 92% versus 97% of the best tool. Finally, we presented a case study on classifying immune cell populations in breast cancer using a hierarchical approach based on GOWDL.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
38171931	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Advancing single-cell RNA-seq data analysis through the fusion of multi-layer perceptron and graph neural network.	The advancement of single-cell sequencing technology has smoothed the ability to do biological studies at the cellular level. Nevertheless, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data presents several obstacles due to the considerable heterogeneity, sparsity and complexity. Although many machine-learning models have been devised to tackle these difficulties, there is still a need to enhance their efficiency and accuracy. Current deep learning methods often fail to fully exploit the intrinsic interconnections within cells, resulting in unsatisfactory results. Given these obstacles, we propose a unique approach for analyzing scRNA-seq data called scMPN. This methodology integrates multi-layer perceptron and graph neural network, including attention network, to execute gene imputation and cell clustering tasks. In order to evaluate the gene imputation performance of scMPN, several metrics like cosine similarity, median L1 distance and root mean square error are used. These metrics are utilized to compare the efficacy of scMPN with other existing approaches. This research utilizes criteria such as adjusted mutual information, normalized mutual information and integrity score to assess the efficacy of cell clustering across different approaches. The superiority of scMPN over current single-cell data processing techniques in cell clustering and gene imputation investigations is shown by the experimental findings obtained from four datasets with gold-standard cell labels. This observation demonstrates the efficacy of our suggested methodology in using deep learning methodologies to enhance the interpretation of scRNA-seq data.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
37991248	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Transfer learning for clustering single-cell RNA-seq data crossing-species and batch, case on uterine fibroids.	Due to the high dimensionality and sparsity of the gene expression matrix in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, coupled with significant noise generated by shallow sequencing, it poses a great challenge for cell clustering methods. While numerous computational methods have been proposed, the majority of existing approaches center on processing the target dataset itself. This approach disregards the wealth of knowledge present within other species and batches of scRNA-seq data. In light of this, our paper proposes a novel method named graph-based deep embedding clustering (GDEC) that leverages transfer learning across species and batches. GDEC integrates graph convolutional networks, effectively overcoming the challenges posed by sparse gene expression matrices. Additionally, the incorporation of DEC in GDEC enables the partitioning of cell clusters within a lower-dimensional space, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of noise on clustering outcomes. GDEC constructs a model based on existing scRNA-seq datasets and then applying transfer learning techniques to fine-tune the model using a limited amount of prior knowledge gleaned from the target dataset. This empowers GDEC to adeptly cluster scRNA-seq data cross different species and batches. Through cross-species and cross-batch clustering experiments, we conducted a comparative analysis between GDEC and conventional packages. Furthermore, we implemented GDEC on the scRNA-seq data of uterine fibroids. Compared results obtained from the Seurat package, GDEC unveiled a novel cell type (epithelial cells) and identified a notable number of new pathways among various cell types, thus underscoring the enhanced analytical capabilities of GDEC.

37769630	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Self-supervised deep clustering of single-cell RNA-seq data to hierarchically detect rare cell populations.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a widely used technique for characterizing individual cells and studying gene expression at the single-cell level. Clustering plays a vital role in grouping similar cells together for various downstream analyses. However, the high sparsity and dimensionality of large scRNA-seq data pose challenges to clustering performance. Although several deep learning-based clustering algorithms have been proposed, most existing clustering methods have limitations in capturing the precise distribution types of the data or fully utilizing the relationships between cells, leaving a considerable scope for improving the clustering performance, particularly in detecting rare cell populations from large scRNA-seq data. We introduce DeepScena, a novel single-cell hierarchical clustering tool that fully incorporates nonlinear dimension reduction, negative binomial-based convolutional autoencoder for data fitting, and a self-supervision model for cell similarity enhancement. In comprehensive evaluation using multiple large-scale scRNA-seq datasets, DeepScena consistently outperformed seven popular clustering tools in terms of accuracy. Notably, DeepScena exhibits high proficiency in identifying rare cell populations within large datasets that contain large numbers of clusters. When applied to scRNA-seq data of multiple myeloma cells, DeepScena successfully identified not only previously labeled large cell types but also subpopulations in CD14 monocytes, T cells and natural killer cells, respectively.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
37898127	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Single-cell RNA-sequencing data clustering using variational graph attention auto-encoder with self-supervised leaning.	The emergence of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) technology makes it possible to capture their differences at the cellular level, which contributes to studying cell heterogeneity. By extracting, amplifying and sequencing the genome at the individual cell level, scRNA-seq can be used to identify unknown or rare cell types as well as genes differentially expressed in specific cell types under different conditions using clustering for downstream analysis of scRNA-seq. Many clustering algorithms have been developed with much progress. However, scRNA-seq often appears with characteristics of high dimensions, sparsity and even the case of dropout events', which make the performance of scRNA-seq data clustering unsatisfactory. To circumvent the problem, a new deep learning framework, termed variational graph attention auto-encoder (VGAAE), is constructed for scRNA-seq data clustering. In the proposed VGAAE, a multi-head attention mechanism is introduced to learn more robust low-dimensional representations for the original scRNA-seq data and then self-supervised learning is also recommended to refine the clusters, whose number can be automatically determined using Jaccard index. Experiments have been conducted on different datasets and results show that VGAAE outperforms some other state-of-the-art clustering methods.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
38221903	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	scFed: federated learning for cell type classification with scRNA-seq.	The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity and complexity in biological tissues. However, the nature of large, sparse scRNA-seq datasets and privacy regulations present challenges for efficient cell identification. Federated learning provides a solution, allowing efficient and private data use. Here, we introduce scFed, a unified federated learning framework that allows for benchmarking of four classification algorithms without violating data privacy, including single-cell-specific and general-purpose classifiers. We evaluated scFed using eight publicly available scRNA-seq datasets with diverse sizes, species and technologies, assessing its performance via intra-dataset and inter-dataset experimental setups. We find that scFed performs well on a variety of datasets with competitive accuracy to centralized models. Though Transformer-based model excels in centralized training, its performance slightly lags behind single-cell-specific model within the scFed framework, coupled with a notable time complexity concern. Our study not only helps select suitable cell identification methods but also highlights federated learning's potential for privacy-preserving, collaborative biomedical research.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
37507115	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	A comprehensive assessment of hurdle and zero-inflated models for single cell RNA-sequencing analysis.	Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has significantly advanced the understanding of transcriptomic signatures. Although various statistical models have been used to describe the distribution of gene expression across cells, a comprehensive assessment of the different models is missing. Moreover, the growing number of features associated with scRNA-seq datasets creates new challenges for analytical accuracy and computing speed. Here, we developed a Python-based package (TensorZINB) to solve the zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) model using the TensorFlow deep learning framework. We used a sequential initialization method to solve the numerical stability issues associated with hurdle and zero-inflated models. A recursive feature selection protocol was used to optimize feature selections for data processing and downstream differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis. We proposed a class of hybrid models combining nested models to further improve the model's performance. Additionally, we developed a new method to convert a continuous distribution to its equivalent discrete form, so that statistical models can be fairly compared. Finally, we showed that the proposed TensorFlow algorithm (TensorZINB) was numerically stable and that its computing speed and performance were superior to those of existing ZINB solvers. Moreover, we implemented seven hurdle and zero-inflated statistical models in Python and systematically assessed their performance using a real scRNA-seq dataset. We demonstrated that the ZINB model achieved the lowest Akaike information criterion compared with other models tested. Taken together, TensorZINB was accurate, efficient and scalable for the implementation of ZINB and for large-scale scRNA-seq data analysis with DEG identification.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
36592058	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	scGMAAE: Gaussian mixture adversarial autoencoders for diversification analysis of scRNA-seq data.	The progress of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has led to a large number of scRNA-seq data, which are widely used in biomedical research. The noise in the raw data and tens of thousands of genes pose a challenge to capture the real structure and effective information of scRNA-seq data. Most of the existing single-cell analysis methods assume that the low-dimensional embedding of the raw data belongs to a Gaussian distribution or a low-dimensional nonlinear space without any prior information, which limits the flexibility and controllability of the model to a great extent. In addition, many existing methods need high computational cost, which makes them difficult to be used to deal with large-scale datasets. Here, we design and develop a depth generation model named Gaussian mixture adversarial autoencoders (scGMAAE), assuming that the low-dimensional embedding of different types of cells follows different Gaussian distributions, integrating Bayesian variational inference and adversarial training, as to give the interpretable latent representation of complex data and discover the statistical distribution of different types of cells. The scGMAAE is provided with good controllability, interpretability and scalability. Therefore, it can process large-scale datasets in a short time and give competitive results. scGMAAE outperforms existing methods in several ways, including dimensionality reduction visualization, cell clustering, differential expression analysis and batch effect removal. Importantly, compared with most deep learning methods, scGMAAE requires less iterations to generate the best results.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
37523217	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	scDeepInsight: a supervised cell-type identification method for scRNA-seq data with deep learning.	Annotation of cell-types is a critical step in the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data that allows the study of heterogeneity across multiple cell populations. Currently, this is most commonly done using unsupervised clustering algorithms, which project single-cell expression data into a lower dimensional space and then cluster cells based on their distances from each other. However, as these methods do not use reference datasets, they can only achieve a rough classification of cell-types, and it is difficult to improve the recognition accuracy further. To effectively solve this issue, we propose a novel supervised annotation method, scDeepInsight. The scDeepInsight method is capable of performing manifold assignments. It is competent in executing data integration through batch normalization, performing supervised training on the reference dataset, doing outlier detection and annotating cell-types on query datasets. Moreover, it can help identify active genes or marker genes related to cell-types. The training of the scDeepInsight model is performed in a unique way. Tabular scRNA-seq data are first converted to corresponding images through the DeepInsight methodology. DeepInsight can create a trainable image transformer to convert non-image RNA data to images by comprehensively comparing interrelationships among multiple genes. Subsequently, the converted images are fed into convolutional neural networks such as EfficientNet-b3. This enables automatic feature extraction to identify the cell-types of scRNA-seq samples. We benchmarked scDeepInsight with six other mainstream cell annotation methods. The average accuracy rate of scDeepInsight reached 87.5%, which is more than 7% higher compared with the state-of-the-art methods.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
37096588	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Benchmarking of analytical combinations for COVID-19 outcome prediction using single-cell RNA sequencing data.	The advances of single-cell transcriptomic technologies have led to increasing use of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data in large-scale patient cohort studies. The resulting high-dimensional data can be summarized and incorporated into patient outcome prediction models in several ways; however, there is a pressing need to understand the impact of analytical decisions on such model quality. In this study, we evaluate the impact of analytical choices on model choices, ensemble learning strategies and integrate approaches on patient outcome prediction using five scRNA-seq COVID-19 datasets. First, we examine the difference in performance between using single-view feature space versus multi-view feature space. Next, we survey multiple learning platforms from classical machine learning to modern deep learning methods. Lastly, we compare different integration approaches when combining datasets is necessary. Through benchmarking such analytical combinations, our study highlights the power of ensemble learning, consistency among different learning methods and robustness to dataset normalization when using multiple datasets as the model input.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
37200157	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	CIForm as a Transformer-based model for cell-type annotation of large-scale single-cell RNA-seq data.	Single-cell omics technologies have made it possible to analyze the individual cells within a biological sample, providing a more detailed understanding of biological systems. Accurately determining the cell type of each cell is a crucial goal in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) analysis. Apart from overcoming the batch effects arising from various factors, single-cell annotation methods also face the challenge of effectively processing large-scale datasets. With the availability of an increase in the scRNA-seq datasets, integrating multiple datasets and addressing batch effects originating from diverse sources are also challenges in cell-type annotation. In this work, to overcome the challenges, we developed a supervised method called CIForm based on the Transformer for cell-type annotation of large-scale scRNA-seq data. To assess the effectiveness and robustness of CIForm, we have compared it with some leading tools on benchmark datasets. Through the systematic comparisons under various cell-type annotation scenarios, we exhibit that the effectiveness of CIForm is particularly pronounced in cell-type annotation.

37903416	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	scMultiGAN: cell-specific imputation for single-cell transcriptomes with multiple deep generative adversarial networks.	The emergence of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has revolutionized the identification of cell types and the study of cellular states at a single-cell level. Despite its significant potential, scRNA-seq data analysis is plagued by the issue of missing values. Many existing imputation methods rely on simplistic data distribution assumptions while ignoring the intrinsic gene expression distribution specific to cells. This work presents a novel deep-learning model, named scMultiGAN, for scRNA-seq imputation, which utilizes multiple collaborative generative adversarial networks (GAN). Unlike traditional GAN-based imputation methods that generate missing values based on random noises, scMultiGAN employs a two-stage training process and utilizes multiple GANs to achieve cell-specific imputation. Experimental results show the efficacy of scMultiGAN in imputation accuracy, cell clustering, differential gene expression analysis and trajectory analysis, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, scMultiGAN is scalable to large scRNA-seq datasets and consistently performs well across sequencing platforms. The scMultiGAN code is freely available at https://github.com/Galaxy8172/scMultiGAN.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
36733262	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	scGGAN: single-cell RNA-seq imputation by graph-based generative adversarial network.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data are typically with a large number of missing values, which often results in the loss of critical gene signaling information and seriously limit the downstream analysis. Deep learning-based imputation methods often can better handle scRNA-seq data than shallow ones, but most of them do not consider the inherent relations between genes, and the expression of a gene is often regulated by other genes. Therefore, it is essential to impute scRNA-seq data by considering the regional gene-to-gene relations. We propose a novel model (named scGGAN) to impute scRNA-seq data that learns the gene-to-gene relations by Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and global scRNA-seq data distribution by Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). scGGAN first leverages single-cell and bulk genomics data to explore inherent relations between genes and builds a more compact gene relation network to jointly capture the homogeneous and heterogeneous information. Then, it constructs a GCN-based GAN model to integrate the scRNA-seq, gene sequencing data and gene relation network for generating scRNA-seq data, and trains the model through adversarial learning. Finally, it utilizes data generated by the trained GCN-based GAN model to impute scRNA-seq data. Experiments on simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets show that scGGAN can effectively identify dropout events, recover the biologically meaningful expressions, determine subcellular states and types, improve the differential expression analysis and temporal dynamics analysis. Ablation experiments confirm that both the gene relation network and gene sequence data help the imputation of scRNA-seq data.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
37985457	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Predicting gene regulatory links from single-cell RNA-seq data using graph neural networks.	Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful technique for studying gene expression patterns at the single-cell level. Inferring gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from scRNA-seq data provides insight into cellular phenotypes from the genomic level. However, the high sparsity, noise and dropout events inherent in scRNA-seq data present challenges for GRN inference. In recent years, the dramatic increase in data on experimentally validated transcription factors binding to DNA has made it possible to infer GRNs by supervised methods. In this study, we address the problem of GRN inference by framing it as a graph link prediction task. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called GNNLink, which leverages known GRNs to deduce the potential regulatory interdependencies between genes. First, we preprocess the raw scRNA-seq data. Then, we introduce a graph convolutional network-based interaction graph encoder to effectively refine gene features by capturing interdependencies between nodes in the network. Finally, the inference of GRN is obtained by performing matrix completion operation on node features. The features obtained from model training can be applied to downstream tasks such as measuring similarity and inferring causality between gene pairs. To evaluate the performance of GNNLink, we compare it with six existing GRN reconstruction methods using seven scRNA-seq datasets. These datasets encompass diverse ground truth networks, including functional interaction networks, Loss of Function/Gain of Function data, non-specific ChIP-seq data and cell-type-specific ChIP-seq data. Our experimental results demonstrate that GNNLink achieves comparable or superior performance across these datasets, showcasing its robustness and accuracy. Furthermore, we observe consistent performance across datasets of varying scales. For reproducibility, we provide the data and source code of GNNLink on our GitHub repository: https://github.com/sdesignates/GNNLink.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
38168839	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	A critical assessment of clustering algorithms to improve cell clustering and identification in single-cell transcriptome study.	Cell clustering is typically the initial step in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses. The performance of clustering considerably impacts the validity and reproducibility of cell identification. A variety of clustering algorithms have been developed for scRNA-seq data. These algorithms generate cell label sets that assign each cell to a cluster. However, different algorithms usually yield different label sets, which can introduce variations in cell-type identification based on the generated label sets. Currently, the performance of these algorithms has not been systematically evaluated in single-cell transcriptome studies. Herein, we performed a critical assessment of seven state-of-the-art clustering algorithms including four deep learning-based clustering algorithms and commonly used methods Seurat, Cosine-based Tanimoto similarity-refined graph for community detection using Leiden's algorithm (CosTaL) and Single-cell consensus clustering (SC3). We used diverse evaluation indices based on 10 different scRNA-seq benchmarks to systematically evaluate their clustering performance. Our results show that CosTaL, Seurat, Deep Embedding for Single-cell Clustering (DESC) and SC3 consistently outperformed Single-Cell Clustering Assessment Framework and scDeepCluster based on nine effectiveness scores. Notably, CosTaL and DESC demonstrated superior performance in clustering specific cell types. The performance of the single-cell Variational Inference tools varied across different datasets, suggesting its sensitivity to certain dataset characteristics. Notably, DESC exhibited promising results for cell subtype identification and capturing cellular heterogeneity. In addition, SC3 requires more memory and exhibits slower computation speed compared to other algorithms for the same dataset. In sum, this study provides useful guidance for selecting appropriate clustering methods in scRNA-seq data analysis.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
38197309	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Integrated bulk and single-cell transcriptomes reveal pyroptotic signature in prognosis and therapeutic options of hepatocellular carcinoma by combining deep learning.	Although some pyroptosis-related (PR) prognostic models for cancers have been reported, pyroptosis-based features have not been fully discovered at the single-cell level in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, by deeply integrating single-cell and bulk transcriptome data, we systematically investigated significance of the shared pyroptotic signature at both single-cell and bulk levels in HCC prognosis. Based on the pyroptotic signature, a robust PR risk system was constructed to quantify the prognostic risk of individual patient. To further verify capacity of the pyroptotic signature on predicting patients' prognosis, an attention mechanism-based deep neural network classification model was constructed. The mechanisms of prognostic difference in the patients with distinct PR risk were dissected on tumor stemness, cancer pathways, transcriptional regulation, immune infiltration and cell communications. A nomogram model combining PR risk with clinicopathologic data was constructed to evaluate the prognosis of individual patients in clinic. The PR risk could also evaluate therapeutic response to neoadjuvant therapies in HCC patients. In conclusion, the constructed PR risk system enables a comprehensive assessment of tumor microenvironment characteristics, accurate prognosis prediction and rational therapeutic options in HCC.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
36941114	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	SoCube: an innovative end-to-end doublet detection algorithm for analyzing scRNA-seq data.	Doublets formed during single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) severely affect downstream studies, such as differentially expressed gene analysis and cell trajectory inference, and limit the cellular throughput of scRNA-seq. Several doublet detection algorithms are currently available, but their generalization performance could be further improved due to the lack of effective feature-embedding strategies with suitable model architectures. Therefore, SoCube, a novel deep learning algorithm, was developed to precisely detect doublets in various types of scRNA-seq data. SoCube (i) proposed a novel 3D composite feature-embedding strategy that embedded latent gene information and (ii) constructed a multikernel, multichannel CNN-ensembled architecture in conjunction with the feature-embedding strategy. With its excellent performance on benchmark evaluation and several downstream tasks, it is expected to be a powerful algorithm to detect and remove doublets in scRNA-seq data. SoCube is freely provided as an end-to-end tool on the Python official package site PyPi (https://pypi.org/project/socube/) and open-source on GitHub (https://github.com/idrblab/socube/).	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
37080761	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Graph deep learning enabled spatial domains identification for spatial transcriptomics.	Advancing spatially resolved transcriptomics (ST) technologies help biologists comprehensively understand organ function and tissue microenvironment. Accurate spatial domain identification is the foundation for delineating genome heterogeneity and cellular interaction. Motivated by this perspective, a graph deep learning (GDL) based spatial clustering approach is constructed in this paper. First, the deep graph infomax module embedded with residual gated graph convolutional neural network is leveraged to address the gene expression profiles and spatial positions in ST. Then, the Bayesian Gaussian mixture model is applied to handle the latent embeddings to generate spatial domains. Designed experiments certify that the presented method is superior to other state-of-the-art GDL-enabled techniques on multiple ST datasets. The codes and dataset used in this manuscript are summarized at https://github.com/narutoten520/SCGDL.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
37544658	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Identifying spatial domains of spatially resolved transcriptomics via multi-view graph convolutional networks.	MOTIVATION: Recent advances in spatially resolved transcriptomics (ST) technologies enable the measurement of gene expression profiles while preserving cellular spatial context. Linking gene expression of cells with their spatial distribution is essential for better understanding of tissue microenvironment and biological progress. However, effectively combining gene expression data with spatial information to identify spatial domains remains challenging. RESULTS: To deal with the above issue, in this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised learning framework named STMGCN for identifying spatial domains using multi-view graph convolution networks (MGCNs). Specifically, to fully exploit spatial information, we first construct multiple neighbor graphs (views) with different similarity measures based on the spatial coordinates. Then, STMGCN learns multiple view-specific embeddings by combining gene expressions with each neighbor graph through graph convolution networks. Finally, to capture the importance of different graphs, we further introduce an attention mechanism to adaptively fuse view-specific embeddings and thus derive the final spot embedding. STMGCN allows for the effective utilization of spatial context to enhance the expressive power of the latent embeddings with multiple graph convolutions. We apply STMGCN on two simulation datasets and five real spatial transcriptomics datasets with different resolutions across distinct platforms. The experimental results demonstrate that STMGCN obtains competitive results in spatial domain identification compared with five state-of-the-art methods, including spatial and non-spatial alternatives. Besides, STMGCN can detect spatially variable genes with enriched expression patterns in the identified domains. Overall, STMGCN is a powerful and efficient computational framework for identifying spatial domains in spatial transcriptomics data.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
37466210	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Spatial-MGCN: a novel multi-view graph convolutional network for identifying spatial domains with attention mechanism.	MOTIVATION: Recent advances in spatial transcriptomics technologies have enabled gene expression profiles while preserving spatial context. Accurately identifying spatial domains is crucial for downstream analysis and it requires the effective integration of gene expression profiles and spatial information. While increasingly computational methods have been developed for spatial domain detection, most of them cannot adaptively learn the complex relationship between gene expression and spatial information, leading to sub-optimal performance. RESULTS: To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel deep learning method named Spatial-MGCN for identifying spatial domains, which is a Multi-view Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) with attention mechanism. We first construct two neighbor graphs using gene expression profiles and spatial information, respectively. Then, a multi-view GCN encoder is designed to extract unique embeddings from both the feature and spatial graphs, as well as their shared embeddings by combining both graphs. Finally, a zero-inflated negative binomial decoder is used to reconstruct the original expression matrix by capturing the global probability distribution of gene expression profiles. Moreover, Spatial-MGCN incorporates a spatial regularization constraint into the features learning to preserve spatial neighbor information in an end-to-end manner. The experimental results show that Spatial-MGCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods consistently in several tasks, including spatial clustering and trajectory inference.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
37253690	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Precision oncology: a review to assess interpretability in several explainable methods.	Great efforts have been made to develop precision medicine-based treatments using machine learning. In this field, where the goal is to provide the optimal treatment for each patient based on his/her medical history and genomic characteristics, it is not sufficient to make excellent predictions. The challenge is to understand and trust the model's decisions while also being able to easily implement it. However, one of the issues with machine learning algorithms-particularly deep learning-is their lack of interpretability. This review compares six different machine learning methods to provide guidance for defining interpretability by focusing on accuracy, multi-omics capability, explainability and implementability. Our selection of algorithms includes tree-, regression- and kernel-based methods, which we selected for their ease of interpretation for the clinician. We also included two novel explainable methods in the comparison. No significant differences in accuracy were observed when comparing the methods, but an improvement was observed when using gene expression instead of mutational status as input for these methods. We concentrated on the current intriguing challenge: model comprehension and ease of use. Our comparison suggests that the tree-based methods are the most interpretable of those tested.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
37756592	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Attention-based generative adversarial networks improve prognostic outcome prediction of cancer from multimodal data.	The prediction of prognostic outcome is critical for the development of efficient cancer therapeutics and potential personalized medicine. However, due to the heterogeneity and diversity of multimodal data of cancer, data integration and feature selection remain a challenge for prognostic outcome prediction. We proposed a deep learning method with generative adversarial network based on sequential channel-spatial attention modules (CSAM-GAN), a multimodal data integration and feature selection approach, for accomplishing prognostic stratification tasks in cancer. Sequential channel-spatial attention modules equipped with an encoder-decoder are applied for the input features of multimodal data to accurately refine selected features. A discriminator network was proposed to make the generator and discriminator learning in an adversarial way to accurately describe the complex heterogeneous information of multiple modal data. We conducted extensive experiments with various feature selection and classification methods and confirmed that the CSAM-GAN via the multilayer deep neural network (DNN) classifier outperformed these baseline methods on two different multimodal data sets with miRNA expression, mRNA expression and histopathological image data: lower-grade glioma and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma. The CSAM-GAN via the multilayer DNN classifier bridges the gap between heterogenous multimodal data and prognostic outcome prediction.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
37643374	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	DeepICSH: a complex deep learning framework for identifying cell-specific silencers and their strength from the human genome.	Silencers are noncoding DNA sequence fragments located on the genome that suppress gene expression. The variation of silencers in specific cells is closely related to gene expression and cancer development. Computational approaches that exclusively rely on DNA sequence information for silencer identification fail to account for the cell specificity of silencers, resulting in diminished accuracy. Despite the discovery of several transcription factors and epigenetic modifications associated with silencers on the genome, there is still no definitive biological signal or combination thereof to fully characterize silencers, posing challenges in selecting suitable biological signals for their identification. Therefore, we propose a sophisticated deep learning framework called DeepICSH, which is based on multiple biological data sources. Specifically, DeepICSH leverages a deep convolutional neural network to automatically capture biologically relevant signal combinations strongly associated with silencers, originating from a diverse array of biological signals. Furthermore, the utilization of attention mechanisms facilitates the scoring and visualization of these signal combinations, whereas the employment of skip connections facilitates the fusion of multilevel sequence features and signal combinations, thereby empowering the accurate identification of silencers within specific cells. Extensive experiments on HepG2 and K562 cell line data sets demonstrate that DeepICSH outperforms state-of-the-art methods in silencer identification. Notably, we introduce for the first time a deep learning framework based on multi-omics data for classifying strong and weak silencers, achieving favorable performance. In conclusion, DeepICSH shows great promise for advancing the study and analysis of silencers in complex diseases.

36653906	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	DIST: spatial transcriptomics enhancement using deep learning.	Spatially resolved transcriptomics technologies enable comprehensive measurement of gene expression patterns in the context of intact tissues. However, existing technologies suffer from either low resolution or shallow sequencing depth. Here, we present DIST, a deep learning-based method that imputes the gene expression profiles on unmeasured locations and enhances the gene expression for both original measured spots and imputed spots by self-supervised learning and transfer learning. We evaluate the performance of DIST for imputation, clustering, differential expression analysis and functional enrichment analysis. The results show that DIST can impute the gene expression accurately, enhance the gene expression for low-quality data, help detect more biological meaningful differentially expressed genes and pathways, therefore allow for deeper insights into the biological processes.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
38189544	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	stAA: adversarial graph autoencoder for spatial clustering task of spatially resolved transcriptomics.	With the development of spatially resolved transcriptomics technologies, it is now possible to explore the gene expression profiles of single cells while preserving their spatial context. Spatial clustering plays a key role in spatial transcriptome data analysis. In the past 2 years, several graph neural network-based methods have emerged, which significantly improved the accuracy of spatial clustering. However, accurately identifying the boundaries of spatial domains remains a challenging task. In this article, we propose stAA, an adversarial variational graph autoencoder, to identify spatial domain. stAA generates cell embedding by leveraging gene expression and spatial information using graph neural networks and enforces the distribution of cell embeddings to a prior distribution through Wasserstein distance. The adversarial training process can make cell embeddings better capture spatial domain information and more robust. Moreover, stAA incorporates global graph information into cell embeddings using labels generated by pre-clustering. Our experimental results show that stAA outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and achieves better clustering results across different profiling platforms and various resolutions. We also conducted numerous biological analyses and found that stAA can identify fine-grained structures in tissues, recognize different functional subtypes within tumors and accurately identify developmental trajectories.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
37824741	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Decoding functional cell-cell communication events by multi-view graph learning on spatial transcriptomics.	Cell-cell communication events (CEs) are mediated by multiple ligand-receptor (LR) pairs. Usually only a particular subset of CEs directly works for a specific downstream response in a particular microenvironment. We name them as functional communication events (FCEs) of the target responses. Decoding FCE-target gene relations is: important for understanding the mechanisms of many biological processes, but has been intractable due to the mixing of multiple factors and the lack of direct observations. We developed a method HoloNet for decoding FCEs using spatial transcriptomic data by integrating LR pairs, cell-type spatial distribution and downstream gene expression into a deep learning model. We modeled CEs as a multi-view network, developed an attention-based graph learning method to train the model for generating target gene expression with the CE networks, and decoded the FCEs for specific downstream genes by interpreting trained models. We applied HoloNet on three Visium datasets of breast cancer and liver cancer. The results detangled the multiple factors of FCEs by revealing how LR signals and cell types affect specific biological processes, and specified FCE-induced effects in each single cell. We conducted simulation experiments and showed that HoloNet is more reliable on LR prioritization in comparison with existing methods. HoloNet is a powerful tool to illustrate cell-cell communication landscapes and reveal vital FCEs that shape cellular phenotypes. HoloNet is available as a Python package at https://github.com/lhc17/HoloNet.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
38145948	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	THItoGene: a deep learning method for predicting spatial transcriptomics from histological images.	Spatial transcriptomics unveils the complex dynamics of cell regulation and transcriptomes, but it is typically cost-prohibitive. Predicting spatial gene expression from histological images via artificial intelligence offers a more affordable option, yet existing methods fall short in extracting deep-level information from pathological images. In this paper, we present THItoGene, a hybrid neural network that utilizes dynamic convolutional and capsule networks to adaptively sense potential molecular signals in histological images for exploring the relationship between high-resolution pathology image phenotypes and regulation of gene expression. A comprehensive benchmark evaluation using datasets from human breast cancer and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma has demonstrated the superior performance of THItoGene in spatial gene expression prediction. Moreover, THItoGene has demonstrated its capacity to decipher both the spatial context and enrichment signals within specific tissue regions.

37996959	2023	Genome biology	CREaTor: zero-shot cis-regulatory pattern modeling with attention mechanisms.	Linking cis-regulatory sequences to target genes has been a long-standing challenge. In this study, we introduce CREaTor, an attention-based deep neural network designed to model cis-regulatory patterns for genomic elements up to 2 Mb from target genes. Coupled with a training strategy that predicts gene expression from flanking candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs), CREaTor can model cell type-specific cis-regulatory patterns in new cell types without prior knowledge of cCRE-gene interactions or additional training. The zero-shot modeling capability, combined with the use of only RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data, allows for the ready generalization of CREaTor to a broad range of cell types.	RNA-seq_records.filtered.tsv
37974217	2023	Genome biology	N-of-one differential gene expression without control samples using a deep generative model.	Differential analysis of bulk RNA-seq data often suffers from lack of good controls. Here, we present a generative model that replaces controls, trained solely on healthy tissues. The unsupervised model learns a low-dimensional representation and can identify the closest normal representation for a given disease sample. This enables control-free, single-sample differential expression analysis. In breast cancer, we demonstrate how our approach selects marker genes and outperforms a state-of-the-art method. Furthermore, significant genes identified by the model are enriched in driver genes across cancers. Our results show that the in silico closest normal provides a more favorable comparison than control samples.	RNA-seq_records.filtered.tsv
37950331	2023	Genome biology	Evaluation of deep learning-based feature selection for single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis.	BACKGROUND: Feature selection is an essential task in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data analysis and can be critical for gene dimension reduction and downstream analyses, such as gene marker identification and cell type classification. Most popular methods for feature selection from scRNA-seq data are based on the concept of differential distribution wherein a statistical model is used to detect changes in gene expression among cell types. Recent development of deep learning-based feature selection methods provides an alternative approach compared to traditional differential distribution-based methods in that the importance of a gene is determined by neural networks. RESULTS: In this work, we explore the utility of various deep learning-based feature selection methods for scRNA-seq data analysis. We sample from Tabula Muris and Tabula Sapiens atlases to create scRNA-seq datasets with a range of data properties and evaluate the performance of traditional and deep learning-based feature selection methods for cell type classification, feature selection reproducibility and diversity, and computational time. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a reference for future development and application of deep learning-based feature selection methods for single-cell omics data analyses.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv

Many deep learning-based methods have been proposed to handle complex single-cell data. Deep learning approaches may also prove useful to jointly analyze single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell T cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq) data for novel discoveries. We developed scNAT, a deep learning method that integrates paired scRNA-seq and scTCR-seq data to represent data in a unified latent space for downstream analysis. We demonstrate that scNAT is capable of removing batch effects, and identifying cell clusters and a T cell migration trajectory from blood to cerebrospinal fluid in multiple sclerosis.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv

We developed a deep-learning-based method, GeneSegNet, that integrates both gene expression and imaging information to perform cell segmentation. GeneSegNet also employs a recursive training strategy to deal with noisy training labels. We show that GeneSegNet significantly improves cell segmentation performances over existing methods that either ignore gene expression information or underutilize imaging information.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
36849204	2023	Genome research	Complex hierarchical structures in single-cell genomics data unveiled by deep hyperbolic manifold learning.	With the advances in single-cell sequencing techniques, numerous analytical methods have been developed for delineating cell development. However, most are based on Euclidean space, which would distort the complex hierarchical structure of cell differentiation. Recently, methods acting on hyperbolic space have been proposed to visualize hierarchical structures in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data and have been proven to be superior to methods acting on Euclidean space. However, these methods have fundamental limitations and are not optimized for the highly sparse single-cell count data. To address these limitations, we propose scDHMap, a model-based deep learning approach to visualize the complex hierarchical structures of scRNA-seq data in low-dimensional hyperbolic space. The evaluations on extensive simulation and real experiments show that scDHMap outperforms existing dimensionality-reduction methods in various common analytical tasks as needed for scRNA-seq data, including revealing trajectory branches, batch correction, and denoising the count matrix with high dropout rates. In addition, we extend scDHMap to visualize single-cell ATAC-seq data.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
36526433	2023	Genome research	Cross-species cell-type assignment from single-cell RNA-seq data by a heterogeneous graph neural network.	Cross-species comparative analyses of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data allow us to explore, at single-cell resolution, the origins of the cellular diversity and evolutionary mechanisms that shape cellular form and function. Cell-type assignment is a crucial step to achieve that. However, the poorly annotated genome and limited known biomarkers hinder us from assigning cell identities for nonmodel species. Here, we design a heterogeneous graph neural network model, CAME, to learn aligned and interpretable cell and gene embeddings for cross-species cell-type assignment and gene module extraction from scRNA-seq data. CAME achieves significant improvements in cell-type characterization across distant species owing to the utilization of non-one-to-one homologous gene mapping ignored by early methods. Our large-scale benchmarking study shows that CAME significantly outperforms five classical methods in terms of cell-type assignment and model robustness to insufficiency and inconsistency of sequencing depths. CAME can transfer the major cell types and interneuron subtypes of human brains to mouse and discover shared cell-type-specific functions in homologous gene modules. CAME can align the trajectories of human and macaque spermatogenesis and reveal their conservative expression dynamics. In short, CAME can make accurate cross-species cell-type assignments even for nonmodel species and uncover shared and divergent characteristics between two species from scRNA-seq data.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
36624151	2023	Nature biotechnology	Cell-type-specific prediction of 3D chromatin organization enables high-throughput in silico genetic screening.	Investigating how chromatin organization determines cell-type-specific gene expression remains challenging. Experimental methods for measuring three-dimensional chromatin organization, such as Hi-C, are costly and have technical limitations, restricting their broad application particularly in high-throughput genetic perturbations. We present C.Origami, a multimodal deep neural network that performs de novo prediction of cell-type-specific chromatin organization using DNA sequence and two cell-type-specific genomic features-CTCF binding and chromatin accessibility. C.Origami enables in silico experiments to examine the impact of genetic changes on chromatin interactions. We further developed an in silico genetic screening approach to assess how individual DNA elements may contribute to chromatin organization and to identify putative cell-type-specific trans-acting regulators that collectively determine chromatin architecture. Applying this approach to leukemia cells and normal T cells, we demonstrate that cell-type-specific in silico genetic screening, enabled by C.Origami, can be used to systematically discover novel chromatin regulation circuits in both normal and disease-related biological systems.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
37550580	2023	Nature methods	Unsupervised removal of systematic background noise from droplet-based single-cell experiments using CellBender.	Droplet-based single-cell assays, including single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq), generate considerable background noise counts, the hallmark of which is nonzero counts in cell-free droplets and off-target gene expression in unexpected cell types. Such systematic background noise can lead to batch effects and spurious differential gene expression results. Here we develop a deep generative model based on the phenomenology of noise generation in droplet-based assays. The proposed model accurately distinguishes cell-containing droplets from cell-free droplets, learns the background noise profile and provides noise-free quantification in an end-to-end fashion. We implement this approach in the scalable and robust open-source software package CellBender. Analysis of simulated data demonstrates that CellBender operates near the theoretically optimal denoising limit. Extensive evaluations using real datasets and experimental benchmarks highlight enhanced concordance between droplet-based single-cell data and established gene expression patterns, while the learned background noise profile provides evidence of degraded or uncaptured cell types.

With the exponential growth of multi-omics data, its integration and utilization have brought unprecedented opportunities for the interpretation of gene regulation mechanisms and the comprehensive analyses of biological systems. IAnimal (https://ianimal.pro/), a cross-species, multi-omics knowledgebase, was developed to improve the utilization of massive public data and simplify the integration of multi-omics information to mine the genetic mechanisms of objective traits. Currently, IAnimal provides 61 191 individual omics data of genome (WGS), transcriptome (RNA-Seq), epigenome (ChIP-Seq, ATAC-Seq) and genome annotation information for 21 species, such as mice, pigs, cattle, chickens, and macaques. The scale of its total clean data has reached 846.46 TB. To better understand the biological significance of omics information, a deep learning model for IAnimal was built based on BioBERT and AutoNER to mine 'gene' and 'trait' entities from 2 794 237 abstracts, which has practical significance for comprehending how each omics layer regulates genes to affect traits. By means of user-friendly web interfaces, flexible data application programming interfaces, and abundant functional modules, IAnimal enables users to easily query, mine, and visualize characteristics in various omics, and to infer how genes play biological roles under the influence of various omics layers.

36629274	2023	Nucleic acids research	Single-cell gene regulatory network prediction by explainable AI.	The molecular heterogeneity of cancer cells contributes to the often partial response to targeted therapies and relapse of disease due to the escape of resistant cell populations. While single-cell sequencing has started to improve our understanding of this heterogeneity, it offers a mostly descriptive view on cellular types and states. To obtain more functional insights, we propose scGeneRAI, an explainable deep learning approach that uses layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) to infer gene regulatory networks from static single-cell RNA sequencing data for individual cells. We benchmark our method with synthetic data and apply it to single-cell RNA sequencing data of a cohort of human lung cancers. From the predicted single-cell networks our approach reveals characteristic network patterns for tumor cells and normal epithelial cells and identifies subnetworks that are observed only in (subgroups of) tumor cells of certain patients. While current state-of-the-art methods are limited by their ability to only predict average networks for cell populations, our approach facilitates the reconstruction of networks down to the level of single cells which can be utilized to characterize the heterogeneity of gene regulation within and across tumors.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
37811885	2023	Nucleic acids research	STAMarker: determining spatial domain-specific variable genes with saliency maps in deep learning.	Spatial transcriptomics characterizes gene expression profiles while retaining the information of the spatial context, providing an unprecedented opportunity to understand cellular systems. One of the essential tasks in such data analysis is to determine spatially variable genes (SVGs), which demonstrate spatial expression patterns. Existing methods only consider genes individually and fail to model the inter-dependence of genes. To this end, we present an analytic tool STAMarker for robustly determining spatial domain-specific SVGs with saliency maps in deep learning. STAMarker is a three-stage ensemble framework consisting of graph-attention autoencoders, multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifiers, and saliency map computation by the backpropagated gradient. We illustrate the effectiveness of STAMarker and compare it with serveral commonly used competing methods on various spatial transcriptomic data generated by different platforms. STAMarker considers all genes at once and is more robust when the dataset is very sparse. STAMarker could identify spatial domain-specific SVGs for characterizing spatial domains and enable in-depth analysis of the region of interest in the tissue section.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
37948464	2023	PLoS computational biology	Attention-based deep clustering method for scRNA-seq cell type identification.	Single-cell sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology provides higher resolution of cellular differences than bulk RNA sequencing and reveals the heterogeneity in biological research. The analysis of scRNA-seq datasets is premised on the subpopulation assignment. When an appropriate reference is not available, such as specific marker genes and single-cell reference atlas, unsupervised clustering approaches become the predominant option. However, the inherent sparsity and high-dimensionality of scRNA-seq datasets pose specific analytical challenges to traditional clustering methods. Therefore, a various deep learning-based methods have been proposed to address these challenges. As each method improves partially, a comprehensive method needs to be proposed. In this article, we propose a novel scRNA-seq data clustering method named AttentionAE-sc (Attention fusion AutoEncoder for single-cell). Two different scRNA-seq clustering strategies are combined through an attention mechanism, that include zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB)-based methods dealing with the impact of dropout events and graph autoencoder (GAE)-based methods relying on information from neighbors to guide the dimension reduction. Based on an iterative fusion between denoising and topological embeddings, AttentionAE-sc can easily acquire clustering-friendly cell representations that similar cells are closer in the hidden embedding. Compared with several state-of-art baseline methods, AttentionAE-sc demonstrated excellent clustering performance on 16 real scRNA-seq datasets without the need to specify the number of groups. Additionally, AttentionAE-sc learned improved cell representations and exhibited enhanced stability and robustness. Furthermore, AttentionAE-sc achieved remarkable identification in a breast cancer single-cell atlas dataset and provided valuable insights into the heterogeneity among different cell subtypes.

37379341	2023	PLoS computational biology	Cell-type annotation with accurate unseen cell-type identification using multiple references.	The recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) techniques have stimulated efforts to identify and characterize the cellular composition of complex tissues. With the advent of various sequencing techniques, automated cell-type annotation using a well-annotated scRNA-seq reference becomes popular. But it relies on the diversity of cell types in the reference, which may not capture all the cell types present in the query data of interest. There are generally unseen cell types in the query data of interest because most data atlases are obtained for different purposes and techniques. Identifying previously unseen cell types is essential for improving annotation accuracy and uncovering novel biological discoveries. To address this challenge, we propose mtANN (multiple-reference-based scRNA-seq data annotation), a new method to automatically annotate query data while accurately identifying unseen cell types with the aid of multiple references. Key innovations of mtANN include the integration of deep learning and ensemble learning to improve prediction accuracy, and the introduction of a new metric that considers three complementary aspects to distinguish between unseen cell types and shared cell types. Additionally, we provide a data-driven method to adaptively select a threshold for identifying previously unseen cell types. We demonstrate the advantages of mtANN over state-of-the-art methods for unseen cell-type identification and cell-type annotation on two benchmark dataset collections, as well as its predictive power on a collection of COVID-19 datasets. The source code and tutorial are available at https://github.com/Zhangxf-ccnu/mtANN.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
36952569	2023	PLoS computational biology	A systematic evaluation of deep learning methods for the prediction of drug synergy in cancer.	One of the main obstacles to the successful treatment of cancer is the phenomenon of drug resistance. A common strategy to overcome resistance is the use of combination therapies. However, the space of possibilities is huge and efficient search strategies are required. Machine Learning (ML) can be a useful tool for the discovery of novel, clinically relevant anti-cancer drug combinations. In particular, deep learning (DL) has become a popular choice for modeling drug combination effects. Here, we set out to examine the impact of different methodological choices on the performance of multimodal DL-based drug synergy prediction methods, including the use of different input data types, preprocessing steps and model architectures. Focusing on the NCI ALMANAC dataset, we found that feature selection based on prior biological knowledge has a positive impact-limiting gene expression data to cancer or drug response-specific genes improved performance. Drug features appeared to be more predictive of drug response, with a 41% increase in coefficient of determination (R2) and 26% increase in Spearman correlation relative to a baseline model that used only cell line and drug identifiers. Molecular fingerprint-based drug representations performed slightly better than learned representations-ECFP4 fingerprints increased R2 by 5.3% and Spearman correlation by 2.8% w.r.t the best learned representations. In general, fully connected feature-encoding subnetworks outperformed other architectures. DL outperformed other ML methods by more than 35% (R2) and 14% (Spearman). Additionally, an ensemble combining the top DL and ML models improved performance by about 6.5% (R2) and 4% (Spearman). Using a state-of-the-art interpretability method, we showed that DL models can learn to associate drug and cell line features with drug response in a biologically meaningful way. The strategies explored in this study will help to improve the development of computational methods for the rational design of effective drug combinations for cancer therapy.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
37939200	2023	PLoS computational biology	MIGGRI: A multi-instance graph neural network model for inferring gene regulatory networks for Drosophila from spatial expression images.	Recent breakthrough in spatial transcriptomics has brought great opportunities for exploring gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from a brand-new perspective. Especially, the local expression patterns and spatio-temporal regulation mechanisms captured by spatial expression images allow more delicate delineation of the interplay between transcript factors and their target genes. However, the complexity and size of spatial image collections pose significant challenges to GRN inference using image-based methods. Extracting regulatory information from expression images is difficult due to the lack of supervision and the multi-instance nature of the problem, where a gene often corresponds to multiple images captured from different views. While graph models, particularly graph neural networks, have emerged as a promising method for leveraging underlying structure information from known GRNs, incorporating expression images into graphs is not straightforward. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage approach, MIGGRI, for capturing comprehensive regulatory patterns from image collections for each gene and known interactions. Our approach involves a multi-instance graph neural network (GNN) model for GRN inference, which first extracts gene regulatory features from spatial expression images via contrastive learning, and then feeds them to a multi-instance GNN for semi-supervised learning. We apply our approach to a large set of Drosophila embryonic spatial gene expression images. MIGGRI achieves outstanding performance in the inference of GRNs for early eye development and mesoderm development of Drosophila, and shows robustness in the scenarios of missing image information. Additionally, we perform interpretable analysis on image reconstruction and functional subgraphs that may reveal potential pathways or coordinate regulations. By leveraging the power of graph neural networks and the information contained in spatial expression images, our approach has the potential to advance our understanding of gene regulation in complex biological systems.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
39558581	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Tiberius: end-to-end deep learning with an HMM for gene prediction.	MOTIVATION: For more than 25 years, learning-based eukaryotic gene predictors were driven by hidden Markov models (HMMs), which were directly inputted a DNA sequence. Recently, Holst et al. demonstrated with their program Helixer that the accuracy of ab initio eukaryotic gene prediction can be improved by combining deep learning layers with a separate HMM postprocessor. RESULTS: We present Tiberius, a novel deep learning-based ab initio gene predictor that end-to-end integrates convolutional and long short-term memory layers with a differentiable HMM layer. Tiberius uses a custom gene prediction loss and was trained for prediction in mammalian genomes and evaluated on human and two other genomes. It significantly outperforms existing ab initio methods, achieving F1 scores of 62% at gene level for the human genome, compared to 21% for the next best ab initio method. In de novo mode, Tiberius predicts the exon-intron structure of two out of three human genes without error. Remarkably, even Tiberius's ab initio accuracy matches that of BRAKER3, which uses RNA-seq data and a protein database. Tiberius's highly parallelized model is the fastest state-of-the-art gene prediction method, processing the human genome in under 2 hours.

MOTIVATION: Over the last two decades, transcriptomics has become a standard technique in biomedical research. We now have large databases of RNA-seq data, accompanied by valuable metadata detailing scientific objectives and the experimental procedures used. The metadata is crucial in understanding and replicating published studies, but so far has been underutilized in helping researchers to discover existing datasets.

38390963	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Phenotype prediction from single-cell RNA-seq data using attention-based neural networks.	MOTIVATION: A patient's disease phenotype can be driven and determined by specific groups of cells whose marker genes are either unknown or can only be detected at late-stage using conventional bulk assays such as RNA-Seq technology. Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enable gene expression profiling in cell-level resolution, and therefore have the potential to identify those cells driving the disease phenotype even while the number of these cells is small. However, most existing methods rely heavily on accurate cell type detection, and the number of available annotated samples is usually too small for training deep learning predictive models. RESULTS: Here, we propose the method ScRAT for phenotype prediction using scRNA-seq data. To train ScRAT with a limited number of samples of different phenotypes, such as coronavirus disease (COVID) and non-COVID, ScRAT first applies a mixup module to increase the number of training samples. A multi-head attention mechanism is employed to learn the most informative cells for each phenotype without relying on a given cell type annotation. Using three public COVID datasets, we show that ScRAT outperforms other phenotype prediction methods. The performance edge of ScRAT over its competitors increases as the number of training samples decreases, indicating the efficacy of our sample mixup. Critical cell types detected based on high-attention cells also support novel findings in the original papers and the recent literature. This suggests that ScRAT overcomes the challenge of missing marker genes and limited sample number with great potential revealing novel molecular mechanisms and/or therapies. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The code of our proposed method ScRAT is published at https://github.com/yuzhenmao/ScRAT.	RNA-seq_records.filtered.tsv

"MOTIVATION: Continuous advancements in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology have enabled researchers to further explore the study of cell heterogeneity, trajectory inference, identification of rare cell types, and neurology. Accurate scRNA-seq data clustering is crucial in single-cell sequencing data analysis. However, the high dimensionality, sparsity, and presence of ""false"" zero values in the data can pose challenges to clustering. Furthermore, current unsupervised clustering algorithms have not effectively leveraged prior biological knowledge, making cell clustering even more challenging. RESULTS: This study investigates a semisupervised clustering model called scTPC, which integrates the triplet constraint, pairwise constraint, and cross-entropy constraint based on deep learning. Specifically, the model begins by pretraining a denoising autoencoder based on a zero-inflated negative binomial distribution. Deep clustering is then performed in the learned latent feature space using triplet constraints and pairwise constraints generated from partial labeled cells. Finally, to address imbalanced cell-type datasets, a weighted cross-entropy loss is introduced to optimize the model. A series of experimental results on 10 real scRNA-seq datasets and five simulated datasets demonstrate that scTPC achieves accurate clustering with a well-designed framework. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: scTPC is a Python-based algorithm, and the code is available from https://github.com/LF-Yang/Code or https://zenodo.org/records/10951780."	scRNA-seq_records.tsv

MOTIVATION: Understanding cellular decision-making, particularly its timing and impact on the biological system such as tissue health and function, is a fundamental challenge in biology and medicine. Existing methods for inferring fate decisions and cellular state dynamics from single-cell RNA sequencing data lack precision regarding decision points and broader tissue implications. Addressing this gap, we present FateNet, a computational approach integrating dynamical systems theory and deep learning to probe the cell decision-making process using scRNA-seq data. RESULTS: By leveraging information about normal forms and scaling behavior near bifurcations common to many dynamical systems, FateNet predicts cell decision occurrence with higher accuracy than conventional methods and offers qualitative insights into the new state of the biological system. Also, through in-silico perturbation experiments, FateNet identifies key genes and pathways governing the differentiation process in hematopoiesis.

38810116	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Inferring gene regulatory networks from single-cell transcriptomics based on graph embedding.	MOTIVATION: Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) encode gene regulation in living organisms, and have become a critical tool to understand complex biological processes. However, due to the dynamic and complex nature of gene regulation, inferring GRNs from scRNA-seq data is still a challenging task. Existing computational methods usually focus on the close connections between genes, and ignore the global structure and distal regulatory relationships. RESULTS: In this study, we develop a supervised deep learning framework, IGEGRNS, to infer GRNs from scRNA-seq data based on graph embedding. In the framework, contextual information of genes is captured by GraphSAGE, which aggregates gene features and neighborhood structures to generate low-dimensional embedding for genes. Then, the k most influential nodes in the whole graph are filtered through Top-k pooling. Finally, potential regulatory relationships between genes are predicted by stacking CNNs. Compared with nine competing supervised and unsupervised methods, our method achieves better performance on six time-series scRNA-seq datasets.

MOTIVATION: Copy number variations (CNVs) are common genetic alterations in tumour cells. The delineation of CNVs holds promise for enhancing our comprehension of cancer progression. Moreover, accurate inference of CNVs from single-cell sequencing data is essential for unravelling intratumoral heterogeneity. However, existing inference methods face limitations in resolution and sensitivity. RESULTS: To address these challenges, we present CopyVAE, a deep learning framework based on a variational autoencoder architecture. Through experiments, we demonstrated that CopyVAE can accurately and reliably detect CNVs from data obtained using single-cell RNA sequencing. CopyVAE surpasses existing methods in terms of sensitivity and specificity. We also discussed CopyVAE's potential to advance our understanding of genetic alterations and their impact on disease advancement.

MOTIVATION: Gene set enrichment (GSE) analysis allows for an interpretation of gene expression through pre-defined gene set databases and is a critical step in understanding different phenotypes. With the rapid development of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology, GSE analysis can be performed on fine-grained gene expression data to gain a nuanced understanding of phenotypes of interest. However, with the cellular heterogeneity in single-cell gene profiles, current statistical GSE analysis methods sometimes fail to identify enriched gene sets. Meanwhile, deep learning has gained traction in applications like clustering and trajectory inference in single-cell studies due to its prowess in capturing complex data patterns. However, its use in GSE analysis remains limited, due to interpretability challenges. RESULTS: In this paper, we present DeepGSEA, an explainable deep gene set enrichment analysis approach which leverages the expressiveness of interpretable, prototype-based neural networks to provide an in-depth analysis of GSE. DeepGSEA learns the ability to capture GSE information through our designed classification tasks, and significance tests can be performed on each gene set, enabling the identification of enriched sets. The underlying distribution of a gene set learned by DeepGSEA can be explicitly visualized using the encoded cell and cellular prototype embeddings. We demonstrate the performance of DeepGSEA over commonly used GSE analysis methods by examining their sensitivity and specificity with four simulation studies. In addition, we test our model on three real scRNA-seq datasets and illustrate the interpretability of DeepGSEA by showing how its results can be explained.

38317025	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	AGImpute: imputation of scRNA-seq data based on a hybrid GAN with dropouts identification.	MOTIVATION: Dropout events bring challenges in analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing data as they introduce noise and distort the true distributions of gene expression profiles. Recent studies focus on estimating dropout probability and imputing dropout events by leveraging information from similar cells or genes. However, the number of dropout events differs in different cells, due to the complex factors, such as different sequencing protocols, cell types, and batch effects. The dropout event differences are not fully considered in assessing the similarities between cells and genes, which compromises the reliability of downstream analysis. RESULTS: This work proposes a hybrid Generative Adversarial Network with dropouts identification to impute single-cell RNA sequencing data, named AGImpute. First, the numbers of dropout events in different cells in scRNA-seq data are differentially estimated by using a dynamic threshold estimation strategy. Next, the identified dropout events are imputed by a hybrid deep learning model, combining Autoencoder with a Generative Adversarial Network. To validate the efficiency of the AGImpute, it is compared with seven state-of-the-art dropout imputation methods on two simulated datasets and seven real single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. The results show that AGImpute imputes the least number of dropout events than other methods. Moreover, AGImpute enhances the performance of downstream analysis, including clustering performance, identifying cell-specific marker genes, and inferring trajectory in the time-course dataset.

38366925	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scSemiGCN: boosting cell-type annotation from noise-resistant graph neural networks with extremely limited supervision.	MOTIVATION: Cell-type annotation is fundamental in revealing cell heterogeneity for single-cell data analysis. Although a host of works have been developed, the low signal-to-noise-ratio single-cell RNA-sequencing data that suffers from batch effects and dropout still poses obstacles in discovering grouped patterns for cell types by unsupervised learning and its alternative-semi-supervised learning that utilizes a few labeled cells as guidance for cell-type annotation. RESULTS: We propose a robust cell-type annotation method scSemiGCN based on graph convolutional networks. Built upon a denoised network structure that characterizes reliable cell-to-cell connections, scSemiGCN generates pseudo labels for unannotated cells. Then supervised contrastive learning follows to refine the noisy single-cell data. Finally, message passing with the refined features over the denoised network structure is conducted for semi-supervised cell-type annotation. Comparison over several datasets with six methods under extremely limited supervision validates the effectiveness and efficiency of scSemiGCN for cell-type annotation.

38192003	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	FAVA: high-quality functional association networks inferred from scRNA-seq and proteomics data.	MOTIVATION: Protein networks are commonly used for understanding how proteins interact. However, they are typically biased by data availability, favoring well-studied proteins with more interactions. To uncover functions of understudied proteins, we must use data that are not affected by this literature bias, such as single-cell RNA-seq and proteomics. Due to data sparseness and redundancy, functional association analysis becomes complex. RESULTS: To address this, we have developed FAVA (Functional Associations using Variational Autoencoders), which compresses high-dimensional data into a low-dimensional space. FAVA infers networks from high-dimensional omics data with much higher accuracy than existing methods, across a diverse collection of real as well as simulated datasets. FAVA can process large datasets with over 0.5 million conditions and has predicted 4210 interactions between 1039 understudied proteins. Our findings showcase FAVA's capability to offer novel perspectives on protein interactions. FAVA functions within the scverse ecosystem, employing AnnData as its input source. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Source code, documentation, and tutorials for FAVA are accessible on GitHub at https://github.com/mikelkou/fava.

38924517	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	PredGCN: a Pruning-enabled Gene-Cell Net for automatic cell annotation of single cell transcriptome data.	MOTIVATION: The annotation of cell types from single-cell transcriptomics is essential for understanding the biological identity and functionality of cellular populations. Although manual annotation remains the gold standard, the advent of automatic pipelines has become crucial for scalable, unbiased, and cost-effective annotations. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of these automatic methods, particularly those employing deep learning, significantly depends on the architecture of the classifier and the quality and diversity of the training datasets. RESULTS: To address these limitations, we present a Pruning-enabled Gene-Cell Net (PredGCN) incorporating a Coupled Gene-Cell Net (CGCN) to enable representation learning and information storage. PredGCN integrates a Gene Splicing Net (GSN) and a Cell Stratification Net (CSN), employing a pruning operation (PrO) to dynamically tackle the complexity of heterogeneous cell identification. Among them, GSN leverages multiple statistical and hypothesis-driven feature extraction methods to selectively assemble genes with specificity for scRNA-seq data while CSN unifies elements based on diverse region demarcation principles, exploiting the representations from GSN and precise identification from different regional homogeneity perspectives. Furthermore, we develop a multi-objective Pareto pruning operation (Pareto PrO) to expand the dynamic capabilities of CGCN, optimizing the sub-network structure for accurate cell type annotation. Multiple comparison experiments on real scRNA-seq datasets from various species have demonstrated that PredGCN surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, including its scalability to cross-species datasets. Moreover, PredGCN can uncover unknown cell types and provide functional genomic analysis by quantifying the influence of genes on cell clusters, bringing new insights into cell type identification and characterizing scRNA-seq data from different perspectives.

SUMMARY: Single-cell Hi-C (scHi-C) protocol helps identify cell-type-specific chromatin interactions and sheds light on cell differentiation and disease progression. Despite providing crucial insights, scHi-C data is often underutilized due to the high cost and the complexity of the experimental protocol. We present a deep learning framework, scGrapHiC, that predicts pseudo-bulk scHi-C contact maps using pseudo-bulk scRNA-seq data. Specifically, scGrapHiC performs graph deconvolution to extract genome-wide single-cell interactions from a bulk Hi-C contact map using scRNA-seq as a guiding signal. Our evaluations show that scGrapHiC, trained on seven cell-type co-assay datasets, outperforms typical sequence encoder approaches. For example, scGrapHiC achieves a substantial improvement of 23.2% in recovering cell-type-specific Topologically Associating Domains over the baselines. It also generalizes to unseen embryo and brain tissue samples. scGrapHiC is a novel method to generate cell-type-specific scHi-C contact maps using widely available genomic signals that enables the study of cell-type-specific chromatin interactions.

39172488	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	LineageVAE: reconstructing historical cell states and transcriptomes toward unobserved progenitors.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables comprehensive characterization of the cell state. However, its destructive nature prohibits measuring gene expression changes during dynamic processes such as embryogenesis or cell state divergence due to injury or disease. Although recent studies integrating scRNA-seq with lineage tracing have provided clonal insights between progenitor and mature cells, challenges remain. Because of their experimental nature, observations are sparse, and cells observed in the early state are not the exact progenitors of cells observed at later time points. To overcome these limitations, we developed LineageVAE, a novel computational methodology that utilizes deep learning based on the property that cells sharing barcodes have identical progenitors. RESULTS: LineageVAE is a deep generative model that transforms scRNA-seq observations with identical lineage barcodes into sequential trajectories toward a common progenitor in a latent cell state space. This method enables the reconstruction of unobservable cell state transitions, historical transcriptomes, and regulatory dynamics at a single-cell resolution. Applied to hematopoiesis and reprogrammed fibroblast datasets, LineageVAE demonstrated its ability to restore backward cell state transitions and infer progenitor heterogeneity and transcription factor activity along differentiation trajectories. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The LineageVAE model was implemented in Python using the PyTorch deep learning library. The code is available on GitHub at https://github.com/LzrRacer/LineageVAE/.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
39230694	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scNODE : generative model for temporal single cell transcriptomic data prediction.	SUMMARY: Measurement of single-cell gene expression at different timepoints enables the study of cell development. However, due to the resource constraints and technical challenges associated with the single-cell experiments, researchers can only profile gene expression at discrete and sparsely sampled timepoints. This missing timepoint information impedes downstream cell developmental analyses. We propose scNODE, an end-to-end deep learning model that can predict in silico single-cell gene expression at unobserved timepoints. scNODE integrates a variational autoencoder with neural ordinary differential equations to predict gene expression using a continuous and nonlinear latent space. Importantly, we incorporate a dynamic regularization term to learn a latent space that is robust against distribution shifts when predicting single-cell gene expression at unobserved timepoints. Our evaluations on three real-world scRNA-seq datasets show that scNODE achieves higher predictive performance than state-of-the-art methods. We further demonstrate that scNODE's predictions help cell trajectory inference under the missing timepoint paradigm and the learned latent space is useful for in silico perturbation analysis of relevant genes along a developmental cell path. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/rsinghlab/scNODE.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
38950180	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	SFINN: inferring gene regulatory network from single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data with shared factor neighborhood and integrated neural network.	MOTIVATION: The rise of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology presents new opportunities for constructing detailed cell type-specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs) to study cell heterogeneity. However, challenges caused by noises, technical errors, and dropout phenomena in scRNA-seq data pose significant obstacles to GRN inference, making the design of accurate GRN inference algorithms still essential. The recent growth of both single-cell and spatial transcriptomic sequencing data enables the development of supervised deep learning methods to infer GRNs on these diverse single-cell datasets. RESULTS: In this study, we introduce a novel deep learning framework based on shared factor neighborhood and integrated neural network (SFINN) for inferring potential interactions and causalities between transcription factors and target genes from single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data. SFINN utilizes shared factor neighborhood to construct cellular neighborhood network based on gene expression data and additionally integrates cellular network generated from spatial location information. Subsequently, the cell adjacency matrix and gene pair expression are fed into an integrated neural network framework consisting of a graph convolutional neural network and a fully-connected neural network to determine whether the genes interact. Performance evaluation in the tasks of gene interaction and causality prediction against the existing GRN reconstruction algorithms demonstrates the usability and competitiveness of SFINN across different kinds of data. SFINN can be applied to infer GRNs from conventional single-cell sequencing data and spatial transcriptomic data.

MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing has emerged as a powerful technology for studying gene expression at the individual cell level. Clustering individual cells into distinct subpopulations is fundamental in scRNA-seq data analysis, facilitating the identification of cell types and exploration of cellular heterogeneity. Despite the recent development of many deep learning-based single-cell clustering methods, few have effectively exploited the correlations among genes, resulting in suboptimal clustering outcomes. RESULTS: Here, we propose a novel masked autoencoder-based method, scMAE, for cell clustering. scMAE perturbs gene expression and employs a masked autoencoder to reconstruct the original data, learning robust and informative cell representations. The masked autoencoder introduces a masking predictor, which captures relationships among genes by predicting whether gene expression values are masked. By integrating this masking mechanism, scMAE effectively captures latent structures and dependencies in the data, enhancing clustering performance. We conducted extensive comparative experiments using various clustering evaluation metrics on 15 scRNA-seq datasets from different sequencing platforms. Experimental results indicate that scMAE outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on these datasets. In addition, scMAE accurately identifies rare cell types, which are challenging to detect due to their low abundance. Furthermore, biological analyses confirm the biological significance of the identified cell subpopulations. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code of scMAE is available at: https://zenodo.org/records/10465991.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv

MOTIVATION: Spatial clustering is essential and challenging for spatial transcriptomics' data analysis to unravel tissue microenvironment and biological function. Graph neural networks are promising to address gene expression profiles and spatial location information in spatial transcriptomics to generate latent representations. However, choosing an appropriate graph deep learning module and graph neural network necessitates further exploration and investigation. RESULTS: In this article, we present GRAPHDeep to assemble a spatial clustering framework for heterogeneous spatial transcriptomics data. Through integrating 2 graph deep learning modules and 20 graph neural networks, the most appropriate combination is decided for each dataset. The constructed spatial clustering method is compared with state-of-the-art algorithms to demonstrate its effectiveness and superiority. The significant new findings include: (i) the number of genes or proteins of spatial omics data is quite crucial in spatial clustering algorithms; (ii) the variational graph autoencoder is more suitable for spatial clustering tasks than deep graph infomax module; (iii) UniMP, SAGE, SuperGAT, GATv2, GCN, and TAG are the recommended graph neural networks for spatial clustering tasks; and (iv) the used graph neural network in the existent spatial clustering frameworks is not the best candidate. This study could be regarded as desirable guidance for choosing an appropriate graph neural network for spatial clustering.

39230702	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Predicting spatially resolved gene expression via tissue morphology using adaptive spatial GNNs.	MOTIVATION: Spatial transcriptomics technologies, which generate a spatial map of gene activity, can deepen the understanding of tissue architecture and its molecular underpinnings in health and disease. However, the high cost makes these technologies difficult to use in practice. Histological images co-registered with targeted tissues are more affordable and routinely generated in many research and clinical studies. Hence, predicting spatial gene expression from the morphological clues embedded in tissue histological images provides a scalable alternative approach to decoding tissue complexity. RESULTS: Here, we present a graph neural network based framework to predict the spatial expression of highly expressed genes from tissue histological images. Extensive experiments on two separate breast cancer data cohorts demonstrate that our method improves the prediction performance compared to the state-of-the-art, and that our model can be used to better delineate spatial domains of biological interest.

39680906	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	CrossIsoFun: predicting isoform functions using the integration of multi-omics data.	MOTIVATION: Isoforms spliced from the same gene may carry distinct biological functions. Therefore, annotating functions at the isoform level provides valuable insights into the functional diversity of genomes. Since experimental approaches for determining isoform functions are time- and cost-demanding, computational methods have been proposed. In this case, multi-omics data integration helps enhance the model performance, providing complementary insights for isoform functions. However, current methods underperform in leveraging diverse omics data, primarily due to the limited power to integrate the heterogeneous feature domains. Besides, among the multi-omics data, isoform-isoform interactions (IIIs) are a key data source, as isoforms interact with each other to perform functions. Unfortunately, IIIs remain largely underutilized in isoform function predictions until now. RESULTS: We introduce CrossIsoFun, a multi-omics data analysis framework for isoform function prediction. CrossIsoFun combines omics-specific and cross-omics learning for data integration and function prediction. In detail, CrossIsoFun uses a graph convolutional network (GCN) as the omics-specific classifier for each data source. The initial label predictions from GCNs are forwarded to the View Correlation Discovery Network (VCDN) and processed as a cross-omics integrative representation. The representation is then used to produce final predictions of isoform functions. In addition, an antoencoder within a cycle-consistency generative adversarial network (cycleGAN) is designed to generate IIIs from PPIs and thereby enrich the interactomics data. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three tissue-naive datasets and 15 tissue-specific datasets with mRNA expression, sequence, and PPI data. The prediction of CrossIsoFun is further validated by its consistency with subcellular localization and isoform-level annotations with literature support.

MOTIVATION: 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), a crucial epigenetic mark with a significant role in regulating tissue-specific gene expression, is essential for understanding the dynamic functions of the human genome. Despite its importance, predicting 5hmC modification across the genome remains a challenging task, especially when considering the complex interplay between DNA sequences and various epigenetic factors such as histone modifications and chromatin accessibility. RESULTS: Using tissue-specific 5hmC sequencing data, we introduce Deep5hmC, a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates both the DNA sequence and epigenetic features such as histone modification and chromatin accessibility to predict genome-wide 5hmC modification. The multimodal design of Deep5hmC demonstrates remarkable improvement in predicting both qualitative and quantitative 5hmC modification compared to unimodal versions of Deep5hmC and state-of-the-art machine learning methods. This improvement is demonstrated through benchmarking on a comprehensive set of 5hmC sequencing data collected at four developmental stages during forebrain organoid development and across 17 human tissues. Compared to DeepSEA and random forest, Deep5hmC achieves close to 4% and 17% improvement of Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) across four forebrain developmental stages, and 6% and 27% across 17 human tissues for predicting binary 5hmC modification sites; and 8% and 22% improvement of Spearman correlation coefficient across four forebrain developmental stages, and 17% and 30% across 17 human tissues for predicting continuous 5hmC modification. Notably, Deep5hmC showcases its practical utility by accurately predicting gene expression and identifying differentially hydroxymethylated regions (DhMRs) in a case-control study of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Deep5hmC significantly improves our understanding of tissue-specific gene regulation and facilitates the development of new biomarkers for complex diseases.

39418177	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	A multi-modality and multi-granularity collaborative learning framework for identifying spatial domains and spatially variable genes.	MOTIVATION: Recent advances in spatial transcriptomics technologies have provided multi-modality data integrating gene expression, spatial context, and histological images. Accurately identifying spatial domains and spatially variable genes is crucial for understanding tissue structures and biological functions. However, effectively combining multi-modality data to identify spatial domains and determining SVGs closely related to these spatial domains remains a challenge. RESULTS: In this study, we propose spatial transcriptomics multi-modality and multi-granularity collaborative learning (spaMMCL). For detecting spatial domains, spaMMCL mitigates the adverse effects of modality bias by masking portions of gene expression data, integrates gene and image features using a shared graph convolutional network, and employs graph self-supervised learning to deal with noise from feature fusion. Simultaneously, based on the identified spatial domains, spaMMCL integrates various strategies to detect potential SVGs at different granularities, enhancing their reliability and biological significance. Experimental results demonstrate that spaMMCL substantially improves the identification of spatial domains and SVGs. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The code and data of spaMMCL are available on Github: Https://github.com/liangxiao-cs/spaMMCL.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
39701601	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Bayesian unsupervised clustering identifies clinically relevant osteosarcoma subtypes.	Identification of cancer subtypes is a critical step for developing precision medicine. Most cancer subtyping is based on the analysis of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from patient cohorts using unsupervised machine learning methods such as hierarchical cluster analysis, but these computational approaches disregard the heterogeneous composition of individual cancer samples. Here, we used a more sophisticated unsupervised Bayesian model termed latent process decomposition (LPD), which handles individual cancer sample heterogeneity and deconvolutes the structure of transcriptome data to provide clinically relevant information. The work was performed on the pediatric tumor osteosarcoma, which is a prototypical model for a rare and heterogeneous cancer. The LPD model detected three osteosarcoma subtypes. The subtype with the poorest prognosis was validated using independent patient datasets. This new stratification framework will be important for more accurate diagnostic labeling, expediting precision medicine, and improving clinical trial success. Our results emphasize the importance of using more sophisticated machine learning approaches (and for teaching deep learning and artificial intelligence) for RNA-seq data analysis, which may assist drug targeting and clinical management.

39800872	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Integrating scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq with inter-type attention heterogeneous graph neural networks.	Single-cell multi-omics techniques, which enable the simultaneous measurement of multiple modalities such as RNA gene expression and Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin (ATAC) within individual cells, have become a powerful tool for deciphering the intricate complexity of cellular systems. Most current methods rely on motif databases to establish cross-modality relationships between genes from RNA-seq data and peaks from ATAC-seq data. However, these approaches are constrained by incomplete database coverage, particularly for novel or poorly characterized relationships. To address these limitations, we introduce single-cell Multi-omics Integration (scMI), a heterogeneous graph embedding method that encodes both cells and modality features from single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data into a shared latent space by learning cross-modality relationships. By modeling cells and modality features as distinct node types, we design an inter-type attention mechanism to effectively capture long-range cross-modality interactions between genes and peaks. Benchmark results demonstrate that embeddings learned by scMI preserve more biological information and achieve comparable or superior performance in downstream tasks including modality prediction, cell clustering, and gene regulatory network inference compared to methods that rely on databases. Furthermore, scMI significantly improves the alignment and integration of unmatched multi-omics data, enabling more accurate embedding and improved outcomes in downstream tasks.

38581418	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	From tradition to innovation: conventional and deep learning frameworks in genome annotation.	Following the milestone success of the Human Genome Project, the 'Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE)' initiative was launched in 2003 to unearth information about the numerous functional elements within the genome. This endeavor coincided with the emergence of numerous novel technologies, accompanied by the provision of vast amounts of whole-genome sequences, high-throughput data such as ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq. Extracting biologically meaningful information from this massive dataset has become a critical aspect of many recent studies, particularly in annotating and predicting the functions of unknown genes. The core idea behind genome annotation is to identify genes and various functional elements within the genome sequence and infer their biological functions. Traditional wet-lab experimental methods still rely on extensive efforts for functional verification. However, early bioinformatics algorithms and software primarily employed shallow learning techniques; thus, the ability to characterize data and features learning was limited. With the widespread adoption of RNA-Seq technology, scientists from the biological community began to harness the potential of machine learning and deep learning approaches for gene structure prediction and functional annotation. In this context, we reviewed both conventional methods and contemporary deep learning frameworks, and highlighted novel perspectives on the challenges arising during annotation underscoring the dynamic nature of this evolving scientific landscape.

39879386	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Inferring the genetic relationships between unsupervised deep learning-derived imaging phenotypes and glioblastoma through multi-omics approaches.	This study aimed to investigate the genetic association between glioblastoma (GBM) and unsupervised deep learning-derived imaging phenotypes (UDIPs). We employed a combination of genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), and scPagwas (pathway-based polygenic regression framework) methods to explore the genetic links between UDIPs and GBM. Two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses were conducted to identify causal relationships between UDIPs and GBM. Colocalization analysis was performed to validate genetic associations, while scPagwas analysis was used to evaluate the relevance of key UDIPs to GBM at the cellular level. Among 512 UDIPs tested, 23 were found to have significant causal associations with GBM. Notably, UDIPs such as T1-33 (OR = 1.007, 95% CI = 1.001 to 1.012, P = .022), T1-34 (OR = 1.012, 95% CI = 1.001-1.023, P = .028), and T1-96 (OR = 1.009, 95% CI = 1.001-1.019, P = .046) were found to have a genetic association with GBM. Furthermore, T1-34 and T1-96 were significantly associated with GBM recurrence, with P-values < .0001 and P < .001, respectively. In addition, scPagwas analysis revealed that T1-33, T1-34, and T1-96 are distinctively linked to different GBM subtypes, with T1-33 showing strong associations with the neural progenitor-like subtype (NPC2), T1-34 with mesenchymal (MES2) and neural progenitor (NPC1) cells, and T1-96 with the NPC2 subtype. T1-33, T1-34, and T1-96 hold significant potential for predicting tumor recurrence and aiding in the development of personalized GBM treatment strategies.	RNA-seq_records.filtered.tsv
39879387	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Classification-based pathway analysis using GPNet with novel P-value computation.	"Pathway analysis plays a critical role in bioinformatics, enabling researchers to identify biological pathways associated with various conditions by analyzing gene expression data. However, the rise of large, multi-center datasets has highlighted limitations in traditional methods like Over-Representation Analysis (ORA) and Functional Class Scoring (FCS), which struggle with low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and large sample sizes. To tackle these challenges, we use a deep learning-based classification method, Gene PointNet, and a novel $P$-value computation approach leveraging the confusion matrix to address pathway analysis tasks. We validated our method effectiveness through a comparative study using a simulated dataset and RNA-Seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas breast cancer dataset. Our method was benchmarked against traditional techniques (ORA, FCS), shallow machine learning models (logistic regression, support vector machine), and deep learning approaches (DeepHisCom, PASNet). The results demonstrate that GPNet outperforms these methods in low-SNR, large-sample datasets, where it remains robust and reliable, significantly reducing both Type I error and improving power. This makes our method well suited for pathway analysis in large, multi-center studies. The code can be found at https://github.com/haolu123/GPNet_pathway"">https://github.com/haolu123/GPNet_pathway."

39438075	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	m6ATM: a deep learning framework for demystifying the m6A epitranscriptome with Nanopore long-read RNA-seq data.	N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is one of the most abundant and well-known modifications in messenger RNAs since its discovery in the 1970s. Recent studies have demonstrated that m6A is involved in various biological processes, such as alternative splicing and RNA degradation, playing an important role in a variety of diseases. To better understand the role of m6A, transcriptome-wide m6A profiling data are indispensable. In recent years, the Oxford Nanopore Technology Direct RNA Sequencing (DRS) platform has shown promise for RNA modification detection based on current disruptions measured in transcripts. However, decoding current intensity data into modification profiles remains a challenging task. Here, we introduce the m6A Transcriptome-wide Mapper (m6ATM), a novel Python-based computational pipeline that applies deep neural networks to predict m6A sites at a single-base resolution using DRS data. The m6ATM model architecture incorporates a WaveNet encoder and a dual-stream multiple-instance learning model to extract features from specific target sites and characterize the m6A epitranscriptome. For validation, m6ATM achieved an accuracy of 80% to 98% across in vitro transcription datasets containing varying m6A modification ratios and outperformed other tools in benchmarking with human cell line data. Moreover, we demonstrated the versatility of m6ATM in providing reliable stoichiometric information and used it to pinpoint PEG10 as a potential m6A target transcript in liver cancer cells. In conclusion, m6ATM is a high-performance m6A detection tool, and our results pave the way for future advancements in epitranscriptomic research.	RNA-seq_records.filtered.tsv
39800874	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	CellMsg: graph convolutional networks for ligand-receptor-mediated cell-cell communication analysis.	The role of cell-cell communications (CCCs) is increasingly recognized as being important to differentiation, invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance in tumoral tissues. Developing CCC inference methods using traditional experimental methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, cannot handle large amounts of data. To facilitate inference of CCCs, we proposed a computational framework, called CellMsg, which involves two primary steps: identifying ligand-receptor interactions (LRIs) and measuring the strength of LRIs-mediated CCCs. Specifically, CellMsg first identifies high-confident LRIs based on multimodal features of ligands and receptors and graph convolutional networks. Then, CellMsg measures the strength of intercellular communication by combining the identified LRIs and single-cell RNA-seq data using a three-point estimation method. Performance evaluation on four benchmark LRI datasets by five-fold cross validation demonstrated that CellMsg accurately captured the relationships between ligands and receptors, resulting in the identification of high-confident LRIs. Compared with other methods of identifying LRIs, CellMsg has better prediction performance and robustness. Furthermore, the LRIs identified by CellMsg were successfully validated through molecular docking. Finally, we examined the overlap of LRIs between CellMsg and five other classical CCC databases, as well as the intercellular crosstalk among seven cell types within a human melanoma tissue. In summary, CellMsg establishes a complete, reliable, and well-organized LRI database and an effective CCC strength evaluation method for each single-cell RNA-seq data. It provides a computational tool allowing researchers to decipher intercellular communications. CellMsg is freely available at https://github.com/pengsl-lab/CellMsg.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
39376034	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	MultiSC: a deep learning pipeline for analyzing multiomics single-cell data.	Single-cell technologies enable researchers to investigate cell functions at an individual cell level and study cellular processes with higher resolution. Several multi-omics single-cell sequencing techniques have been developed to explore various aspects of cellular behavior. Using NEAT-seq as an example, this method simultaneously obtains three kinds of omics data for each cell: gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and protein expression of transcription factors (TFs). Consequently, NEAT-seq offers a more comprehensive understanding of cellular activities in multiple modalities. However, there is a lack of tools available for effectively integrating the three types of omics data. To address this gap, we propose a novel pipeline called MultiSC for the analysis of MULTIomic Single-Cell data. Our pipeline leverages a multimodal constraint autoencoder (single-cell hierarchical constraint autoencoder) to integrate the multi-omics data during the clustering process and a matrix factorization-based model (scMF) to predict target genes regulated by a TF. Moreover, we utilize multivariate linear regression models to predict gene regulatory networks from the multi-omics data. Additional functionalities, including differential expression, mediation analysis, and causal inference, are also incorporated into the MultiSC pipeline. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of MultiSC. The results demonstrate that our pipeline enables researchers to gain a comprehensive view of cell activities and gene regulatory networks by fully leveraging the potential of multiomics single-cell data. By employing MultiSC, researchers can effectively integrate and analyze diverse omics data types, enhancing their understanding of cellular processes.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
38436557	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Innovative super-resolution in spatial transcriptomics: a transformer model exploiting histology images and spatial gene expression.	Spatial transcriptomics technologies have shed light on the complexities of tissue structures by accurately mapping spatial microenvironments. Nonetheless, a myriad of methods, especially those utilized in platforms like Visium, often relinquish spatial details owing to intrinsic resolution limitations. In response, we introduce TransformerST, an innovative, unsupervised model anchored in the Transformer architecture, which operates independently of references, thereby ensuring cost-efficiency by circumventing the need for single-cell RNA sequencing. TransformerST not only elevates Visium data from a multicellular level to a single-cell granularity but also showcases adaptability across diverse spatial transcriptomics platforms. By employing a vision transformer-based encoder, it discerns latent image-gene expression co-representations and is further enhanced by spatial correlations, derived from an adaptive graph Transformer module. The sophisticated cross-scale graph network, utilized in super-resolution, significantly boosts the model's accuracy, unveiling complex structure-functional relationships within histology images. Empirical evaluations validate its adeptness in revealing tissue subtleties at the single-cell scale. Crucially, TransformerST adeptly navigates through image-gene co-representation, maximizing the synergistic utility of gene expression and histology images, thereby emerging as a pioneering tool in spatial transcriptomics. It not only enhances resolution to a single-cell level but also introduces a novel approach that optimally utilizes histology images alongside gene expression, providing a refined lens for investigating spatial transcriptomics.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
39708840	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	scRGCL: a cell type annotation method for single-cell RNA-seq data using residual graph convolutional neural network with contrastive learning.	Cell type annotation is a critical step in analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. A large number of deep learning (DL)-based methods have been proposed to annotate cell types of scRNA-seq data and have achieved impressive results. However, there are several limitations to these methods. First, they do not fully exploit cell-to-cell differential features. Second, they are developed based on shallow features and lack of flexibility in integrating high-order features in the data. Finally, the low-dimensional gene features may lead to overfitting in neural networks. To overcome those limitations, we propose a novel DL-based model, cell type annotation of single-cell RNA-seq data using residual graph convolutional neural network with contrastive learning (scRGCL), based on residual graph convolutional neural network and contrastive learning for cell type annotation of single-cell RNA-seq data. scRGCL mainly consists of a residual graph convolutional neural network, contrastive learning, and weight freezing. A residual graph convolutional neural network is utilized to extract complex high-order features from data. Contrastive learning can help the model learn meaningful cell-to-cell differential features. Weight freezing can avoid overfitting and help the model discover the impact of specific gene expression on cell type annotation. To verify the effectiveness of scRGCL, we compared its performance with six methods (three shallow learning algorithms and three state-of-the-art DL-based methods) on eight single-cell benchmark datasets from two species (seven in human and one in mouse). Experimental results not only show that scRGCL outperforms competing methods but also demonstrate the generalizability of scRGCL for cell type annotation. scRGCL is available at https://github.com/nathanyl/scRGCL.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
38581422	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	HyGAnno: hybrid graph neural network-based cell type annotation for single-cell ATAC sequencing data.	Reliable cell type annotations are crucial for investigating cellular heterogeneity in single-cell omics data. Although various computational approaches have been proposed for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) annotation, high-quality cell labels are still lacking in single-cell sequencing assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (scATAC-seq) data, because of extreme sparsity and inconsistent chromatin accessibility between datasets. Here, we present a novel automated cell annotation method that transfers cell type information from a well-labeled scRNA-seq reference to an unlabeled scATAC-seq target, via a parallel graph neural network, in a semi-supervised manner. Unlike existing methods that utilize only gene expression or gene activity features, HyGAnno leverages genome-wide accessibility peak features to facilitate the training process. In addition, HyGAnno reconstructs a reference-target cell graph to detect cells with low prediction reliability, according to their specific graph connectivity patterns. HyGAnno was assessed across various datasets, showcasing its strengths in precise cell annotation, generating interpretable cell embeddings, robustness to noisy reference data and adaptability to tumor tissues.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
39694816	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	scDCA: deciphering the dominant cell communication assembly of downstream functional events from single-cell RNA-seq data.	Cell-cell communications (CCCs) involve signaling from multiple sender cells that collectively impact downstream functional processes in receiver cells. Currently, computational methods are lacking for quantifying the contribution of pairwise combinations of cell types to specific functional processes in receiver cells (e.g. target gene expression or cell states). This limitation has impeded understanding the underlying mechanisms of cancer progression and identifying potential therapeutic targets. Here, we proposed a deep learning-based method, scDCA, to decipher the dominant cell communication assembly (DCA) that have a higher impact on a particular functional event in receiver cells from single-cell RNA-seq data. Specifically, scDCA employed a multi-view graph convolution network to reconstruct the CCCs landscape at single-cell resolution, and then identified DCA by interpreting the model with the attention mechanism. Taking the samples from advanced renal cell carcinoma as a case study, the scDCA was successfully applied and validated in revealing the DCA affecting the crucial gene expression in immune cells. The scDCA was also applied and validated in revealing the DCA responsible for the variation of 14 typical functional states of malignant cells. Furthermore, the scDCA was applied and validated to explore the alteration of CCCs under clinical intervention by comparing the DCA for certain cytotoxic factors between patients with and without immunotherapy. In summary, scDCA provides a valuable and practical tool for deciphering the cell type combinations with the most dominant impact on a specific functional process of receiver cells, which is of great significance for precise cancer treatment.

39508445	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Graph domain adaptation-based framework for gene expression enhancement and cell type identification in large-scale spatially resolved transcriptomics.	Spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) technologies facilitate gene expression profiling with spatial resolution in a naive state. Nevertheless, current SRT technologies exhibit limitations, manifesting as either low transcript detection sensitivity or restricted gene throughput. These constraints result in diminished precision and coverage in gene measurement. In response, we introduce SpaGDA, a sophisticated deep learning-based graph domain adaptation framework for both scenarios of gene expression imputation and cell type identification in spatially resolved transcriptomics data by impartially transferring knowledge from reference scRNA-seq data. Systematic benchmarking analyses across several SRT datasets generated from different technologies have demonstrated SpaGDA's superior effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art methods in both scenarios. Further applied to three SRT datasets of different biological contexts, SpaGDA not only better recovers the well-established knowledge sourced from public atlases and existing scientific literature but also yields a more informative spatial expression pattern of genes. Together, these results demonstrate that SpaGDA can be used to overcome the challenges of current SRT data and provide more accurate insights into biological processes or disease development. The SpaGDA is available in https://github.com/shenrb/SpaGDA.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
39814561	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Explainable deep neural networks for predicting sample phenotypes from single-cell transcriptomics.	Recent advances in single-cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-Seq) technologies have revolutionized our ability to gather molecular insights into different phenotypes at the level of individual cells. The analysis of the resulting data poses significant challenges, and proper statistical methods are required to analyze and extract information from scRNA-Seq datasets. Sample classification based on gene expression data has proven effective and valuable for precision medicine applications. However, standard classification schemas are often not suitable for scRNA-Seq due to their unique characteristics, and new algorithms are required to effectively analyze and classify samples at the single-cell level. Furthermore, existing methods for this purpose have limitations in their usability. Those reasons motivated us to develop singleDeep, an end-to-end pipeline that streamlines the analysis of scRNA-Seq data training deep neural networks, enabling robust prediction and characterization of sample phenotypes. We used singleDeep to make predictions on scRNA-Seq datasets from different conditions, including systemic lupus erythematosus, Alzheimer's disease and coronavirus disease 2019. Our results demonstrate strong diagnostic performance, validated both internally and externally. Moreover, singleDeep outperformed traditional machine learning methods and alternative single-cell approaches. In addition to prediction accuracy, singleDeep provides valuable insights into cell types and gene importance estimation for phenotypic characterization. This functionality provided additional and valuable information in our use cases. For instance, we corroborated that some interferon signature genes are consistently relevant for autoimmunity across all immune cell types in lupus. On the other hand, we discovered that genes linked to dementia have relevant roles in specific brain cell populations, such as APOE in astrocytes.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
39373051	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	scDFN: enhancing single-cell RNA-seq clustering with deep fusion networks.	Single-cell ribonucleic acid sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology can be used to perform high-resolution analysis of the transcriptomes of individual cells. Therefore, its application has gained popularity for accurately analyzing the ever-increasing content of heterogeneous single-cell datasets. Central to interpreting scRNA-seq data is the clustering of cells to decipher transcriptomic diversity and infer cell behavior patterns. However, its complexity necessitates the application of advanced methodologies capable of resolving the inherent heterogeneity and limited gene expression characteristics of single-cell data. Herein, we introduce a novel deep learning-based algorithm for single-cell clustering, designated scDFN, which can significantly enhance the clustering of scRNA-seq data through a fusion network strategy. The scDFN algorithm applies a dual mechanism involving an autoencoder to extract attribute information and an improved graph autoencoder to capture topological nuances, integrated via a cross-network information fusion mechanism complemented by a triple self-supervision strategy. This fusion is optimized through a holistic consideration of four distinct loss functions. A comparative analysis with five leading scRNA-seq clustering methodologies across multiple datasets revealed the superiority of scDFN, as determined by better the Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) and the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) metrics. Additionally, scDFN demonstrated robust multi-cluster dataset performance and exceptional resilience to batch effects. Ablation studies highlighted the key roles of the autoencoder and the improved graph autoencoder components, along with the critical contribution of the four joint loss functions to the overall efficacy of the algorithm. Through these advancements, scDFN set a new benchmark in single-cell clustering and can be used as an effective tool for the nuanced analysis of single-cell transcriptomics.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
39584702	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	BioDSNN: a dual-stream neural network with hybrid biological knowledge integration for multi-gene perturbation response prediction.	Studying the outcomes of genetic perturbation based on single-cell RNA-seq data is crucial for understanding genetic regulation of cells. However, the high cost of cellular experiments and single-cell sequencing restrict us from measuring the full combination space of genetic perturbations and cell types. Consequently, a bunch of computational models have been proposed to predict unseen combinations based on existing data. Among them, generative models, e.g. variational autoencoder and diffusion models, have the superiority in capturing the perturbed data distribution, but lack a biologically understandable foundation for generalization. On the other side of the spectrum, Gene Regulation Networks or gene pathway knowledge have been exploited for more reasonable generalization enhancement. Unfortunately, they do not reach a balanced processing of the two data modalities, leading to a degraded fitting ability. Hence, we propose a dual-stream architecture. Before the information from two modalities are merged, the sequencing data are learned with a generative model while three types of knowledge data are comprehensively processed with graph networks and a masked transformer, enforcing a deep understanding of single-modality data, respectively. The benchmark results show an approximate 20% reduction in terms of mean squared error, proving the effectiveness of the model.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
38701411	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	AI identifies potent inducers of breast cancer stem cell differentiation based on adversarial learning from gene expression data.	Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a subpopulation of cancer cells within tumors that exhibit stem-like properties and represent a potentially effective therapeutic target toward long-term remission by means of differentiation induction. By leveraging an artificial intelligence approach solely based on transcriptomics data, this study scored a large library of small molecules based on their predicted ability to induce differentiation in stem-like cells. In particular, a deep neural network model was trained using publicly available single-cell RNA-Seq data obtained from untreated human-induced pluripotent stem cells at various differentiation stages and subsequently utilized to screen drug-induced gene expression profiles from the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) database. The challenge of adapting such different data domains was tackled by devising an adversarial learning approach that was able to effectively identify and remove domain-specific bias during the training phase. Experimental validation in MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 cells demonstrated the efficacy of five out of six tested molecules among those scored highest by the model. In particular, the efficacy of triptolide, OTS-167, quinacrine, granisetron and A-443654 offer a potential avenue for targeted therapies against breast CSCs.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
38349062	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Self-supervised deep learning of gene-gene interactions for improved gene expression recovery.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful tool to gain biological insights at the cellular level. However, due to technical limitations of the existing sequencing technologies, low gene expression values are often omitted, leading to inaccurate gene counts. Existing methods, including advanced deep learning techniques, struggle to reliably impute gene expressions due to a lack of mechanisms that explicitly consider the underlying biological knowledge of the system. In reality, it has long been recognized that gene-gene interactions may serve as reflective indicators of underlying biology processes, presenting discriminative signatures of the cells. A genomic data analysis framework that is capable of leveraging the underlying gene-gene interactions is thus highly desirable and could allow for more reliable identification of distinctive patterns of the genomic data through extraction and integration of intricate biological characteristics of the genomic data. Here we tackle the problem in two steps to exploit the gene-gene interactions of the system. We first reposition the genes into a 2D grid such that their spatial configuration reflects their interactive relationships. To alleviate the need for labeled ground truth gene expression datasets, a self-supervised 2D convolutional neural network is employed to extract the contextual features of the interactions from the spatially configured genes and impute the omitted values. Extensive experiments with both simulated and experimental scRNA-seq datasets are carried out to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed strategy against the existing imputation methods.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
38426327	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	scAMAC: self-supervised clustering of scRNA-seq data based on adaptive multi-scale autoencoder.	Cluster assignment is vital to analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to understand high-level biological processes. Deep learning-based clustering methods have recently been widely used in scRNA-seq data analysis. However, existing deep models often overlook the interconnections and interactions among network layers, leading to the loss of structural information within the network layers. Herein, we develop a new self-supervised clustering method based on an adaptive multi-scale autoencoder, called scAMAC. The self-supervised clustering network utilizes the Multi-Scale Attention mechanism to fuse the feature information from the encoder, hidden and decoder layers of the multi-scale autoencoder, which enables the exploration of cellular correlations within the same scale and captures deep features across different scales. The self-supervised clustering network calculates the membership matrix using the fused latent features and optimizes the clustering network based on the membership matrix. scAMAC employs an adaptive feedback mechanism to supervise the parameter updates of the multi-scale autoencoder, obtaining a more effective representation of cell features. scAMAC not only enables cell clustering but also performs data reconstruction through the decoding layer. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that scAMAC is superior to several advanced clustering and imputation methods in both data clustering and reconstruction. In addition, scAMAC is beneficial for downstream analysis, such as cell trajectory inference. Our scAMAC model codes are freely available at https://github.com/yancy2024/scAMAC.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
39800876	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Deep learning in integrating spatial transcriptomics with other modalities.	Spatial transcriptomics technologies have been extensively applied in biological research, enabling the study of transcriptome while preserving the spatial context of tissues. Paired with spatial transcriptomics data, platforms often provide histology and (or) chromatin images, which capture cellular morphology and chromatin organization. Additionally, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from matching tissues often accompany spatial data, offering a transcriptome-wide gene expression profile of individual cells. Integrating such additional data from other modalities can effectively enhance spatial transcriptomics data, and, conversely, spatial transcriptomics data can supplement scRNA-seq with spatial information. Moreover, the rapid development of spatial multi-omics technology has spurred the demand for the integration of spatial multi-omics data to present a more detailed molecular landscape within tissues. Numerous deep learning (DL) methods have been developed for integrating spatial transcriptomics with other modalities. However, a comprehensive review of DL approaches for integrating spatial transcriptomics data with other modalities remains absent. In this study, we systematically review the applications of DL in integrating spatial transcriptomics data with other modalities. We first delineate the DL techniques applied in this integration and the key tasks involved. Next, we detail these methods and categorize them based on integrated modality and key task. Furthermore, we summarize the integration strategies of these integration methods. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future directions in integrating spatial transcriptomics with other modalities, aiming to facilitate the development of robust computational methods that more comprehensively exploit multimodal information.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
39581873	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	VGAE-CCI: variational graph autoencoder-based construction of 3D spatial cell-cell communication network.	Cell-cell communication plays a critical role in maintaining normal biological functions, regulating development and differentiation, and controlling immune responses. The rapid development of single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics sequencing (ST-seq) technologies provides essential data support for in-depth and comprehensive analysis of cell-cell communication. However, ST-seq data often contain incomplete data and systematic biases, which may reduce the accuracy and reliability of predicting cell-cell communication. Furthermore, other methods for analyzing cell-cell communication mainly focus on individual tissue sections, neglecting cell-cell communication across multiple tissue layers, and fail to comprehensively elucidate cell-cell communication networks within three-dimensional tissues. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose VGAE-CCI, a deep learning framework based on the Variational Graph Autoencoder, capable of identifying cell-cell communication across multiple tissue layers. Additionally, this model can be applied to spatial transcriptomics data with missing or partially incomplete data and can clustered cells at single-cell resolution based on spatial encoding information within complex tissues, thereby enabling more accurate inference of cell-cell communication. Finally, we tested our method on six datasets and compared it with other state of art methods for predicting cell-cell communication. Our method outperformed other methods across multiple metrics, demonstrating its efficiency and reliability in predicting cell-cell communication.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
38300515	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	scMMT: a multi-use deep learning approach for cell annotation, protein prediction and embedding in single-cell RNA-seq data.	Accurate cell type annotation in single-cell RNA-sequencing data is essential for advancing biological and medical research, particularly in understanding disease progression and tumor microenvironments. However, existing methods are constrained by single feature extraction approaches, lack of adaptability to immune cell types with similar molecular profiles but distinct functions and a failure to account for the impact of cell label noise on model accuracy, all of which compromise the precision of annotation. To address these challenges, we developed a supervised approach called scMMT. We proposed a novel feature extraction technique to uncover more valuable information. Additionally, we constructed a multi-task learning framework based on the GradNorm method to enhance the recognition of challenging immune cells and reduce the impact of label noise by facilitating mutual reinforcement between cell type annotation and protein prediction tasks. Furthermore, we introduced logarithmic weighting and label smoothing mechanisms to enhance the recognition ability of rare cell types and prevent model overconfidence. Through comprehensive evaluations on multiple public datasets, scMMT has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in various aspects including cell type annotation, rare cell identification, dropout and label noise resistance, protein expression prediction and low-dimensional embedding representation.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
38980373	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	DeepGRNCS: deep learning-based framework for jointly inferring gene regulatory networks across cell subpopulations.	Inferring gene regulatory networks (GRNs) allows us to obtain a deeper understanding of cellular function and disease pathogenesis. Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology have improved the accuracy of GRN inference. However, many methods for inferring individual GRNs from scRNA-seq data are limited because they overlook intercellular heterogeneity and similarities between different cell subpopulations, which are often present in the data. Here, we propose a deep learning-based framework, DeepGRNCS, for jointly inferring GRNs across cell subpopulations. We follow the commonly accepted hypothesis that the expression of a target gene can be predicted based on the expression of transcription factors (TFs) due to underlying regulatory relationships. We initially processed scRNA-seq data by discretizing data scattering using the equal-width method. Then, we trained deep learning models to predict target gene expression from TFs. By individually removing each TF from the expression matrix, we used pre-trained deep model predictions to infer regulatory relationships between TFs and genes, thereby constructing the GRN. Our method outperforms existing GRN inference methods for various simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets. Finally, we applied DeepGRNCS to non-small cell lung cancer scRNA-seq data to identify key genes in each cell subpopulation and analyzed their biological relevance. In conclusion, DeepGRNCS effectively predicts cell subpopulation-specific GRNs. The source code is available at https://github.com/Nastume777/DeepGRNCS.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
39446194	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Structure-preserved integration of scRNA-seq data using heterogeneous graph neural network.	The integration of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from multiple experimental batches enables more comprehensive characterizations of cell states. Given that existing methods disregard the structural information between cells and genes, we proposed a structure-preserved scRNA-seq data integration approach using heterogeneous graph neural network (scHetG). By establishing a heterogeneous graph that represents the interactions between multiple batches of cells and genes, and combining a heterogeneous graph neural network with contrastive learning, scHetG concurrently obtained cell and gene embeddings with structural information. A comprehensive assessment covering different species, tissues and scales indicated that scHetG is an efficacious method for eliminating batch effects while preserving the structural information of cells and genes, including batch-specific cell types and cell-type specific gene co-expression patterns.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
38517692	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	scHybridBERT: integrating gene regulation and cell graph for spatiotemporal dynamics in single-cell clustering.	Graph learning models have received increasing attention in the computational analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Compared with conventional deep neural networks, graph neural networks and language models have exhibited superior performance by extracting graph-structured data from raw gene count matrices. Established deep neural network-based clustering approaches generally focus on temporal expression patterns while ignoring inherent interactions at gene-level as well as cell-level, which could be regarded as spatial dynamics in single-cell data. Both gene-gene and cell-cell interactions are able to boost the performance of cell type detection, under the framework of multi-view modeling. In this study, spatiotemporal embedding and cell graphs are extracted to capture spatial dynamics at the molecular level. In order to enhance the accuracy of cell type detection, this study proposes the scHybridBERT architecture to conduct multi-view modeling of scRNA-seq data using extracted spatiotemporal patterns. In this scHybridBERT method, graph learning models are employed to deal with cell graphs and the Performer model employs spatiotemporal embeddings. Experimental outcomes about benchmark scRNA-seq datasets indicate that the proposed scHybridBERT method is able to enhance the accuracy of single-cell clustering tasks by integrating spatiotemporal embeddings and cell graphs.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
38960404	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Comprehensive single-cell RNA-seq analysis using deep interpretable generative modeling guided by biological hierarchy knowledge.	Recent advances in microfluidics and sequencing technologies allow researchers to explore cellular heterogeneity at single-cell resolution. In recent years, deep learning frameworks, such as generative models, have brought great changes to the analysis of transcriptomic data. Nevertheless, relying on the potential space of these generative models alone is insufficient to generate biological explanations. In addition, most of the previous work based on generative models is limited to shallow neural networks with one to three layers of latent variables, which may limit the capabilities of the models. Here, we propose a deep interpretable generative model called d-scIGM for single-cell data analysis. d-scIGM combines sawtooth connectivity techniques and residual networks, thereby constructing a deep generative framework. In addition, d-scIGM incorporates hierarchical prior knowledge of biological domains to enhance the interpretability of the model. We show that d-scIGM achieves excellent performance in a variety of fundamental tasks, including clustering, visualization, and pseudo-temporal inference. Through topic pathway studies, we found that d-scIGM-learned topics are better enriched for biologically meaningful pathways compared to the baseline models. Furthermore, the analysis of drug response data shows that d-scIGM can capture drug response patterns in large-scale experiments, which provides a promising way to elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms. Lastly, in the melanoma dataset, d-scIGM accurately identified different cell types and revealed multiple melanin-related driver genes and key pathways, which are critical for understanding disease mechanisms and drug development.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
39413798	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	SELF-Former: multi-scale gene filtration transformer for single-cell spatial reconstruction.	The spatial reconstruction of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data into spatial transcriptomics (ST) is a rapidly evolving field that addresses the significant challenge of aligning gene expression profiles to their spatial origins within tissues. This task is complicated by the inherent batch effects and the need for precise gene expression characterization to accurately reflect spatial information. To address these challenges, we developed SELF-Former, a transformer-based framework that utilizes multi-scale structures to learn gene representations, while designing spatial correlation constraints for the reconstruction of corresponding ST data. SELF-Former excels in recovering the spatial information of ST data and effectively mitigates batch effects between scRNA-seq and ST data. A novel aspect of SELF-Former is the introduction of a gene filtration module, which significantly enhances the spatial reconstruction task by selecting genes that are crucial for accurate spatial positioning and reconstruction. The superior performance and effectiveness of SELF-Former's modules have been validated across four benchmark datasets, establishing it as a robust and effective method for spatial reconstruction tasks. SELF-Former demonstrates its capability to extract meaningful gene expression information from scRNA-seq data and accurately map it to the spatial context of real ST data. Our method represents a significant advancement in the field, offering a reliable approach for spatial reconstruction.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
39820437	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	scGO: interpretable deep neural network for cell status annotation and disease diagnosis.	"Machine learning has emerged as a transformative tool for elucidating cellular heterogeneity in single-cell RNA sequencing. However, a significant challenge lies in the ""black box"" nature of deep learning models, which obscures the decision-making process and limits interpretability in cell status annotation. In this study, we introduced scGO, a Gene Ontology (GO)-inspired deep learning framework designed to provide interpretable cell status annotation for scRNA-seq data. scGO employs sparse neural networks to leverage the intrinsic biological relationships among genes, transcription factors, and GO terms, significantly augmenting interpretability and reducing computational cost. scGO outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the precise characterization of cell subtypes across diverse datasets. Our extensive experimentation across a spectrum of scRNA-seq datasets underscored the remarkable efficacy of scGO in disease diagnosis, prediction of developmental stages, and evaluation of disease severity and cellular senescence status. Furthermore, we incorporated in silico individual gene manipulations into the scGO model, introducing an additional layer for discovering therapeutic targets. Our results provide an interpretable model for accurately annotating cell status, capturing latent biological knowledge, and informing clinical practice."	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
39417321	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	scMGATGRN: a multiview graph attention network-based method for inferring gene regulatory networks from single-cell transcriptomic data.	The gene regulatory network (GRN) plays a vital role in understanding the structure and dynamics of cellular systems, revealing complex regulatory relationships, and exploring disease mechanisms. Recently, deep learning (DL)-based methods have been proposed to infer GRNs from single-cell transcriptomic data and achieved impressive performance. However, these methods do not fully utilize graph topological information and high-order neighbor information from multiple receptive fields. To overcome those limitations, we propose a novel model based on multiview graph attention network, namely, scMGATGRN, to infer GRNs. scMGATGRN mainly consists of GAT, multiview, and view-level attention mechanism. GAT can extract essential features of the gene regulatory network. The multiview model can simultaneously utilize local feature information and high-order neighbor feature information of nodes in the gene regulatory network. The view-level attention mechanism dynamically adjusts the relative importance of node embedding representations and efficiently aggregates node embedding representations from two views. To verify the effectiveness of scMGATGRN, we compared its performance with 10 methods (five shallow learning algorithms and five state-of-the-art DL-based methods) on seven benchmark single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets from five cell lines (two in human and three in mouse) with four different kinds of ground-truth networks. The experimental results not only show that scMGATGRN outperforms competing methods but also demonstrate the potential of this model in inferring GRNs. The code and data of scMGATGRN are made freely available on GitHub (https://github.com/nathanyl/scMGATGRN).	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
38261340	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	GMFGRN: a matrix factorization and graph neural network approach for gene regulatory network inference.	The recent advances of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have enabled reliable profiling of gene expression at the single-cell level, providing opportunities for accurate inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) on scRNA-seq data. Most methods for inferring GRNs suffer from the inability to eliminate transitive interactions or necessitate expensive computational resources. To address these, we present a novel method, termed GMFGRN, for accurate graph neural network (GNN)-based GRN inference from scRNA-seq data. GMFGRN employs GNN for matrix factorization and learns representative embeddings for genes. For transcription factor-gene pairs, it utilizes the learned embeddings to determine whether they interact with each other. The extensive suite of benchmarking experiments encompassing eight static scRNA-seq datasets alongside several state-of-the-art methods demonstrated mean improvements of 1.9 and 2.5% over the runner-up in area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). In addition, across four time-series datasets, maximum enhancements of 2.4 and 1.3% in AUROC and AUPRC were observed in comparison to the runner-up. Moreover, GMFGRN requires significantly less training time and memory consumption, with time and memory consumed <10% compared to the second-best method. These findings underscore the substantial potential of GMFGRN in the inference of GRNs. It is publicly available at https://github.com/Lishuoyy/GMFGRN.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
39715685	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	STCGAN: a novel cycle-consistent generative adversarial network for spatial transcriptomics cellular deconvolution.	MOTIVATION: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies have revolutionized our ability to map gene expression patterns within native tissue context, providing unprecedented insights into tissue architecture and cellular heterogeneity. However, accurately deconvolving cell-type compositions from ST spots remains challenging due to the sparse and averaged nature of ST data, which is essential for accurately depicting tissue architecture. While numerous computational methods have been developed for cell-type deconvolution and spatial distribution reconstruction, most fail to capture tissue complexity at the single-cell level, thereby limiting their applicability in practical scenarios. RESULTS: To this end, we propose a novel cycle-consistent generative adversarial network named STCGAN for cellular deconvolution in spatial transcriptomic. STCGAN first employs a cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CGAN) to pre-train on ST data, ensuring that both the mapping from ST data to latent space and its reverse mapping are consistent, capturing complex spatial gene expression patterns and learning robust latent representations. Based on the learned representation, STCGAN then optimizes a trainable cell-to-spot mapping matrix to integrate scRNA-seq data with ST data, accurately estimating cellular composition within each capture spot and effectively reconstructing the spatial distribution of cells across the tissue. To further enhance deconvolution accuracy, we incorporate spatial-aware regularization that ensures accurate cellular distribution reconstruction within the spatial context. Benchmarking against seven state-of-the-art methods on five simulated and real datasets from various tissues, STCGAN consistently delivers superior cell-type deconvolution performance. AVAILABILITY: The code of STCGAN can be downloaded from https://github.com/cs-wangbo/STCGAN and all the mentioned datasets are available on Zenodo at https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10799113.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
38388681	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Continually adapting pre-trained language model to universal annotation of single-cell RNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: Cell-type annotation of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data is a hallmark of biomedical research and clinical application. Current annotation tools usually assume the simultaneous acquisition of well-annotated data, but without the ability to expand knowledge from new data. Yet, such tools are inconsistent with the continuous emergence of scRNA-seq data, calling for a continuous cell-type annotation model. In addition, by their powerful ability of information integration and model interpretability, transformer-based pre-trained language models have led to breakthroughs in single-cell biology research. Therefore, the systematic combining of continual learning and pre-trained language models for cell-type annotation tasks is inevitable. RESULTS: We herein propose a universal cell-type annotation tool, called CANAL, that continuously fine-tunes a pre-trained language model trained on a large amount of unlabeled scRNA-seq data, as new well-labeled data emerges. CANAL essentially alleviates the dilemma of catastrophic forgetting, both in terms of model inputs and outputs. For model inputs, we introduce an experience replay schema that repeatedly reviews previous vital examples in current training stages. This is achieved through a dynamic example bank with a fixed buffer size. The example bank is class-balanced and proficient in retaining cell-type-specific information, particularly facilitating the consolidation of patterns associated with rare cell types. For model outputs, we utilize representation knowledge distillation to regularize the divergence between previous and current models, resulting in the preservation of knowledge learned from past training stages. Moreover, our universal annotation framework considers the inclusion of new cell types throughout the fine-tuning and testing stages. We can continuously expand the cell-type annotation library by absorbing new cell types from newly arrived, well-annotated training datasets, as well as automatically identify novel cells in unlabeled datasets. Comprehensive experiments with data streams under various biological scenarios demonstrate the versatility and high model interpretability of CANAL. AVAILABILITY: An implementation of CANAL is available from https://github.com/aster-ww/CANAL-torch. CONTACT: dengmh@pku.edu.cn.

38555470	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	scNovel: a scalable deep learning-based network for novel rare cell discovery in single-cell transcriptomics.	Single-cell RNA sequencing has achieved massive success in biological research fields. Discovering novel cell types from single-cell transcriptomics has been demonstrated to be essential in the field of biomedicine, yet is time-consuming and needs prior knowledge. With the unprecedented boom in cell atlases, auto-annotation tools have become more prevalent due to their speed, accuracy and user-friendly features. However, existing tools have mostly focused on general cell-type annotation and have not adequately addressed the challenge of discovering novel rare cell types. In this work, we introduce scNovel, a powerful deep learning-based neural network that specifically focuses on novel rare cell discovery. By testing our model on diverse datasets with different scales, protocols and degrees of imbalance, we demonstrate that scNovel significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art novel cell detection models, reaching the most AUROC performance(the only one method whose averaged AUROC results are above 94%, up to 16.26% more comparing to the second-best method). We validate scNovel's performance on a million-scale dataset to illustrate the scalability of scNovel further. Applying scNovel on a clinical COVID-19 dataset, three potential novel subtypes of Macrophages are identified, where the COVID-related differential genes are also detected to have consistent expression patterns through deeper analysis. We believe that our proposed pipeline will be an important tool for high-throughput clinical data in a wide range of applications.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
39508444	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	SpaDiT: diffusion transformer for spatial gene expression prediction using scRNA-seq.	The rapid development of spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) technologies has provided unprecedented opportunities for exploring the structure of specific organs or tissues. However, these techniques (such as image-based SRT) can achieve single-cell resolution, but can only capture the expression levels of tens to hundreds of genes. Such spatial transcriptomics (ST) data, carrying a large number of undetected genes, have limited its application value. To address the challenge, we develop SpaDiT, a deep learning framework for spatial reconstruction and gene expression prediction using scRNA-seq data. SpaDiT employs scRNA-seq data as an a priori condition and utilizes shared genes between ST and scRNA-seq data as latent representations to construct inputs, thereby facilitating the accurate prediction of gene expression in ST data. SpaDiT enhances the accuracy of spatial gene expression predictions over a variety of spatial transcriptomics datasets. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of SpaDiT by conducting extensive experiments on both seq-based and image-based ST data. We compared SpaDiT with eight highly effective baseline methods and found that our proposed method achieved an 8%-12% improvement in performance across multiple metrics. Source code and all datasets used in this paper are available at https://github.com/wenwenmin/SpaDiT and https://zenodo.org/records/12792074.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
39487083	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Graph contrastive learning as a versatile foundation for advanced scRNA-seq data analysis.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers unprecedented insights into transcriptome-wide gene expression at the single-cell level. Cell clustering has been long established in the analysis of scRNA-seq data to identify the groups of cells with similar expression profiles. However, cell clustering is technically challenging, as raw scRNA-seq data have various analytical issues, including high dimensionality and dropout values. Existing research has developed deep learning models, such as graph machine learning models and contrastive learning-based models, for cell clustering using scRNA-seq data and has summarized the unsupervised learning of cell clustering into a human-interpretable format. While advances in cell clustering have been profound, we are no closer to finding a simple yet effective framework for learning high-quality representations necessary for robust clustering. In this study, we propose scSimGCL, a novel framework based on the graph contrastive learning paradigm for self-supervised pretraining of graph neural networks. This framework facilitates the generation of high-quality representations crucial for cell clustering. Our scSimGCL incorporates cell-cell graph structure and contrastive learning to enhance the performance of cell clustering. Extensive experimental results on simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets suggest the superiority of the proposed scSimGCL. Moreover, clustering assignment analysis confirms the general applicability of scSimGCL, including state-of-the-art clustering algorithms. Further, ablation study and hyperparameter analysis suggest the efficacy of our network architecture with the robustness of decisions in the self-supervised learning setting. The proposed scSimGCL can serve as a robust framework for practitioners developing tools for cell clustering. The source code of scSimGCL is publicly available at https://github.com/zhangzh1328/scSimGCL.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
38600666	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Improving drug response prediction via integrating gene relationships with deep learning.	Predicting the drug response of cancer cell lines is crucial for advancing personalized cancer treatment, yet remains challenging due to tumor heterogeneity and individual diversity. In this study, we present a deep learning-based framework named Deep neural network Integrating Prior Knowledge (DIPK) (DIPK), which adopts self-supervised techniques to integrate multiple valuable information, including gene interaction relationships, gene expression profiles and molecular topologies, to enhance prediction accuracy and robustness. We demonstrated the superior performance of DIPK compared to existing methods on both known and novel cells and drugs, underscoring the importance of gene interaction relationships in drug response prediction. In addition, DIPK extends its applicability to single-cell RNA sequencing data, showcasing its capability for single-cell-level response prediction and cell identification. Further, we assess the applicability of DIPK on clinical data. DIPK accurately predicted a higher response to paclitaxel in the pathological complete response (pCR) group compared to the residual disease group, affirming the better response of the pCR group to the chemotherapy compound. We believe that the integration of DIPK into clinical decision-making processes has the potential to enhance individualized treatment strategies for cancer patients.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv

Spatially Resolved Transcriptomics (SRT) serves as a cornerstone in biomedical research, revealing the heterogeneity of tissue microenvironments. Integrating multimodal data including gene expression, spatial coordinates, and morphological information poses significant challenges for accurate spatial domain identification. Herein, we present the Multi-view Contrastive Graph Autoencoder (MCGAE), a cutting-edge deep computational framework specifically designed for the intricate analysis of spatial transcriptomics (ST) data. MCGAE advances the field by creating multi-view representations from gene expression and spatial adjacency matrices. Utilizing modular modeling, contrastive graph convolutional networks, and attention mechanisms, it generates modality-specific spatial representations and integrates them into a unified embedding. This integration process is further enriched by the inclusion of morphological image features, markedly enhancing the framework's capability to process multimodal data. Applied to both simulated and real SRT datasets, MCGAE demonstrates superior performance in spatial domain detection, data denoising, trajectory inference, and 3D feature extraction, outperforming existing methods. Specifically, in colorectal cancer liver metastases, MCGAE integrates histological and gene expression data to identify tumor invasion regions and characterize cellular molecular regulation. This breakthrough extends ST analysis and offers new tools for cancer and complex disease research.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
38670157	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Prior knowledge-guided multilevel graph neural network for tumor risk prediction and interpretation via multi-omics data integration.	The interrelation and complementary nature of multi-omics data can provide valuable insights into the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying diseases. However, challenges such as limited sample size, high data dimensionality and differences in omics modalities pose significant obstacles to fully harnessing the potential of these data. The prior knowledge such as gene regulatory network and pathway information harbors useful gene-gene interaction and gene functional module information. To effectively integrate multi-omics data and make full use of the prior knowledge, here, we propose a Multilevel-graph neural network (GNN): a hierarchically designed deep learning algorithm that sequentially leverages multi-omics data, gene regulatory networks and pathway information to extract features and enhance accuracy in predicting survival risk. Our method achieved better accuracy compared with existing methods. Furthermore, key factors nonlinearly associated with the tumor pathogenesis are prioritized by employing two interpretation algorithms (i.e. GNN-Explainer and IGscore) for neural networks, at gene and pathway level, respectively. The top genes and pathways exhibit strong associations with disease in survival analyses, many of which such as SEC61G and CYP27B1 are previously reported in the literature.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
39780487	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Deciphering progressive lesion areas in breast cancer spatial transcriptomics via TGR-NMF.	Identifying spatial domains is critical for understanding breast cancer tissue heterogeneity and providing insights into tumor progression. However, dropout events introduces computational challenges and the lack of transparency in methods such as graph neural networks limits their interpretability. This study aimed to decipher disease progression-related spatial domains in breast cancer spatial transcriptomics by developing the three graph regularized non-negative matrix factorization (TGR-NMF). A unitization strategy was proposed to mitigate the impact of dropout events on the computational process, enabling utilization of the complete gene expression count data. By integrating one gene expression neighbor topology and two spatial position neighbor topologies, TGR-NMF was developed for constructing an interpretable low-dimensional representation of spatial transcriptomic data. The progressive lesion area that can reveal the progression of breast cancer was uncovered through heterogeneity analysis. Moreover, several related pathogenic genes and signal pathways on this area were identified by using gene enrichment and cell communication analysis.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
38557675	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	SpatialcoGCN: deconvolution and spatial information-aware simulation of spatial transcriptomics data via deep graph co-embedding.	Spatial transcriptomics (ST) data have emerged as a pivotal approach to comprehending the function and interplay of cells within intricate tissues. Nonetheless, analyses of ST data are restricted by the low spatial resolution and limited number of ribonucleic acid transcripts that can be detected with several popular ST techniques. In this study, we propose that both of the above issues can be significantly improved by introducing a deep graph co-embedding framework. First, we establish a self-supervised, co-graph convolution network-based deep learning model termed SpatialcoGCN, which leverages single-cell data to deconvolve the cell mixtures in spatial data. Evaluations of SpatialcoGCN on a series of simulated ST data and real ST datasets from human ductal carcinoma in situ, developing human heart and mouse brain suggest that SpatialcoGCN could outperform other state-of-the-art cell type deconvolution methods in estimating per-spot cell composition. Moreover, with competitive accuracy, SpatialcoGCN could also recover the spatial distribution of transcripts that are not detected by raw ST data. With a similar co-embedding framework, we further established a spatial information-aware ST data simulation method, SpatialcoGCN-Sim. SpatialcoGCN-Sim could generate simulated ST data with high similarity to real datasets. Together, our approaches provide efficient tools for studying the spatial organization of heterogeneous cells within complex tissues.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
39007595	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	DeepIDA-GRU: a deep learning pipeline for integrative discriminant analysis of cross-sectional and longitudinal multiview data with applications to inflammatory bowel disease classification.	Biomedical research now commonly integrates diverse data types or views from the same individuals to better understand the pathobiology of complex diseases, but the challenge lies in meaningfully integrating these diverse views. Existing methods often require the same type of data from all views (cross-sectional data only or longitudinal data only) or do not consider any class outcome in the integration method, which presents limitations. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a pipeline that harnesses the power of statistical and deep learning methods to integrate cross-sectional and longitudinal data from multiple sources. In addition, it identifies key variables that contribute to the association between views and the separation between classes, providing deeper biological insights. This pipeline includes variable selection/ranking using linear and nonlinear methods, feature extraction using functional principal component analysis and Euler characteristics, and joint integration and classification using dense feed-forward networks for cross-sectional data and recurrent neural networks for longitudinal data. We applied this pipeline to cross-sectional and longitudinal multiomics data (metagenomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics) from an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) study and identified microbial pathways, metabolites and genes that discriminate by IBD status, providing information on the etiology of IBD. We conducted simulations to compare the two feature extraction methods.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
39656774	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Inferring single-cell resolution spatial gene expression via fusing spot-based spatial transcriptomics, location, and histology using GCN.	Spatial transcriptomics (ST technology allows for the detection of cellular transcriptome information while preserving the spatial location of cells. This capability enables researchers to better understand the cellular heterogeneity, spatial organization, and functional interactions in complex biological systems. However, current technological methods are limited by low resolution, which reduces the accuracy of gene expression levels. Here, we propose scstGCN, a multimodal information fusion method based on Vision Transformer and Graph Convolutional Network that integrates histological images, spot-based ST data and spatial location information to infer super-resolution gene expression profiles at single-cell level. We evaluated the accuracy of the super-resolution gene expression profiles generated on diverse tissue ST datasets with disease and healthy by scstGCN along with their performance in identifying spatial patterns, conducting functional enrichment analysis, and tissue annotation. The results show that scstGCN can predict super-resolution gene expression accurately and aid researchers in discovering biologically meaningful differentially expressed genes and pathways. Additionally, scstGCN can segment and annotate tissues at a finer granularity, with results demonstrating strong consistency with coarse manual annotations.

39541189	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	SpaGIC: graph-informed clustering in spatial transcriptomics via self-supervised contrastive learning.	Spatial transcriptomics technologies enable the generation of gene expression profiles while preserving spatial context, providing the potential for in-depth understanding of spatial-specific tissue heterogeneity. Leveraging gene and spatial data effectively is fundamental to accurately identifying spatial domains in spatial transcriptomics analysis. However, many existing methods have not yet fully exploited the local neighborhood details within spatial information. To address this issue, we introduce SpaGIC, a novel graph-based deep learning framework integrating graph convolutional networks and self-supervised contrastive learning techniques. SpaGIC learns meaningful latent embeddings of spots by maximizing both edge-wise and local neighborhood-wise mutual information of graph structures, as well as minimizing the embedding distance between spatially adjacent spots. We evaluated SpaGIC on seven spatial transcriptomics datasets across various technology platforms. The experimental results demonstrated that SpaGIC consistently outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods in several tasks, such as spatial domain identification, data denoising, visualization, and trajectory inference. Additionally, SpaGIC is capable of performing joint analyses of multiple slices, further underscoring its versatility and effectiveness in spatial transcriptomics research.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
39764614	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	STMGraph: spatial-context-aware of transcriptomes via a dual-remasked dynamic graph attention model.	Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies enable dissecting the tissue architecture in spatial context. To perceive the global contextual information of gene expression patterns in tissue, the spatial dependence of cells must be fully considered by integrating both local and non-local features by means of spatial-context-aware. However, the current ST integration algorithm ignores for ST dropouts, which impedes the spatial-aware of ST features, resulting in challenges in the accuracy and robustness of microenvironmental heterogeneity detecting, spatial domain clustering, and batch-effects correction. Here, we developed an STMGraph, a universal dual-view dynamic deep learning framework that combines dual-remask (MASK-REMASK) with dynamic graph attention model (DGAT) to exploit ST data outperforming pre-existing tools. The dual-remask mechanism masks the embeddings before encoding and decoding, establishing dual-decoding-view to share features mutually. DGAT leverages self-supervision to update graph linkage relationships from two distinct perspectives, thereby generating a comprehensive representation for each node. Systematic benchmarking against 10 state-of-the-art tools revealed that the STMGraph has the optimal performance with high accuracy and robustness on spatial domain clustering for the datasets of diverse ST platforms from multi- to sub-cellular resolutions. Furthermore, STMGraph aggregates ST information cross regions by dual-remask to realize the batch-effects correction implicitly, allowing for spatial domain clustering of ST multi-slices. STMGraph is platform independent and superior in spatial-context-aware to achieve microenvironmental heterogeneity detection, spatial domain clustering, batch-effects correction, and new biological discovery, and is therefore a desirable novel tool for diverse ST studies.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
39367648	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	An initial game-theoretic assessment of enhanced tissue preparation and imaging protocols for improved deep learning inference of spatial transcriptomics from tissue morphology.	The application of deep learning to spatial transcriptomics (ST) can reveal relationships between gene expression and tissue architecture. Prior work has demonstrated that inferring gene expression from tissue histomorphology can discern these spatial molecular markers to enable population scale studies, reducing the fiscal barriers associated with large-scale spatial profiling. However, while most improvements in algorithmic performance have focused on improving model architectures, little is known about how the quality of tissue preparation and imaging can affect deep learning model training for spatial inference from morphology and its potential for widespread clinical adoption. Prior studies for ST inference from histology typically utilize manually stained frozen sections with imaging on non-clinical grade scanners. Training such models on ST cohorts is also costly. We hypothesize that adopting tissue processing and imaging practices that mirror standards for clinical implementation (permanent sections, automated tissue staining, and clinical grade scanning) can significantly improve model performance. An enhanced specimen processing and imaging protocol was developed for deep learning-based ST inference from morphology. This protocol featured the Visium CytAssist assay to permit automated hematoxylin and eosin staining (e.g. Leica Bond), 40x-resolution imaging, and joining of multiple patients' tissue sections per capture area prior to ST profiling. Using a cohort of 13 pathologic T Stage-III stage colorectal cancer patients, we compared the performance of models trained on slide prepared using enhanced versus traditional (i.e. manual staining and low-resolution imaging) protocols. Leveraging Inceptionv3 neural networks, we predicted gene expression across serial, histologically-matched tissue sections using whole slide images (WSI) from both protocols. The data Shapley was used to quantify and compare marginal performance gains on a patient-by-patient basis attributed to using the enhanced protocol versus the actual costs of spatial profiling. Findings indicate that training and validating on WSI acquired through the enhanced protocol as opposed to the traditional method resulted in improved performance at lower fiscal cost. In the realm of ST, the enhancement of deep learning architectures frequently captures the spotlight; however, the significance of specimen processing and imaging is often understated. This research, informed through a game-theoretic lens, underscores the substantial impact that specimen preparation/imaging can have on spatial transcriptomic inference from morphology. It is essential to integrate such optimized processing protocols to facilitate the identification of prognostic markers at a larger scale.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
38483255	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Deep learning in spatially resolved transcriptfomics: a comprehensive technical view.	Spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) is a pioneering method for simultaneously studying morphological contexts and gene expression at single-cell precision. Data emerging from SRT are multifaceted, presenting researchers with intricate gene expression matrices, precise spatial details and comprehensive histology visuals. Such rich and intricate datasets, unfortunately, render many conventional methods like traditional machine learning and statistical models ineffective. The unique challenges posed by the specialized nature of SRT data have led the scientific community to explore more sophisticated analytical avenues. Recent trends indicate an increasing reliance on deep learning algorithms, especially in areas such as spatial clustering, identification of spatially variable genes and data alignment tasks. In this manuscript, we provide a rigorous critique of these advanced deep learning methodologies, probing into their merits, limitations and avenues for further refinement. Our in-depth analysis underscores that while the recent innovations in deep learning tailored for SRT have been promising, there remains a substantial potential for enhancement. A crucial area that demands attention is the development of models that can incorporate intricate biological nuances, such as phylogeny-aware processing or in-depth analysis of minuscule histology image segments. Furthermore, addressing challenges like the elimination of batch effects, perfecting data normalization techniques and countering the overdispersion and zero inflation patterns seen in gene expression is pivotal. To support the broader scientific community in their SRT endeavors, we have meticulously assembled a comprehensive directory of readily accessible SRT databases, hoping to serve as a foundation for future research initiatives.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv

39708837	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	A review of deep learning models for the prediction of chromatin interactions with DNA and epigenomic profiles.	Advances in three-dimensional (3D) genomics have revealed the spatial characteristics of chromatin interactions in gene expression regulation, which is crucial for understanding molecular mechanisms in biological processes. High-throughput technologies like ChIA-PET, Hi-C, and their derivatives methods have greatly enhanced our knowledge of 3D chromatin architecture. However, the chromatin interaction mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Deep learning, with its powerful feature extraction and pattern recognition capabilities, offers a promising approach for integrating multi-omics data, to build accurate predictive models of chromatin interaction matrices. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in chromatin interaction matrix prediction models. By integrating DNA sequences and epigenetic signals, we investigate the latest developments in these methods. This article details various models, focusing on how one-dimensional (1D) information transforms into the 3D structure chromatin interactions, and how the integration of different deep learning modules specifically affects model accuracy. Additionally, we discuss the critical role of DNA sequence information and epigenetic markers in shaping 3D genome interaction patterns. Finally, this review addresses the challenges in predicting chromatin interaction matrices, in order to improve the precise mapping of chromatin interaction matrices and DNA sequence, and supporting the transformation and theoretical development of 3D genomics across biological systems.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
39841593	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Spatially aligned graph transfer learning for characterizing spatial regulatory heterogeneity.	Spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) technologies facilitate the exploration of cell fates or states within tissue microenvironments. Despite these advances, the field has not adequately addressed the regulatory heterogeneity influenced by microenvironmental factors. Here, we propose a novel Spatially Aligned Graph Transfer Learning (SpaGTL), pretrained on a large-scale multi-modal SRT data of about 100 million cells/spots to enable inference of context-specific spatial gene regulatory networks across multiple scales in data-limited settings. As a novel cross-dimensional transfer learning architecture, SpaGTL aligns spatial graph representations across gene-level graph transformers and cell/spot-level manifold-dominated variational autoencoder. This alignment facilitates the exploration of microenvironmental variations in cell types and functional domains from a molecular regulatory perspective, all within a self-supervised framework. We verified SpaGTL's precision, robustness, and speed over existing state-of-the-art algorithms and show SpaGTL's potential that facilitates the discovery of novel regulatory programs that exhibit strong associations with tissue functional regions and cell types. Importantly, SpaGTL could be extended to process multi-slice SRT data and map molecular regulatory landscape associated with three-dimensional spatial-temporal changes during development.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
38811360	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	SpaNCMG: improving spatial domains identification of spatial transcriptomics using neighborhood-complementary mixed-view graph convolutional network.	The advancement of spatial transcriptomics (ST) technology contributes to a more profound comprehension of the spatial properties of gene expression within tissues. However, due to challenges of high dimensionality, pronounced noise and dynamic limitations in ST data, the integration of gene expression and spatial information to accurately identify spatial domains remains challenging. This paper proposes a SpaNCMG algorithm for the purpose of achieving precise spatial domain description and localization based on a neighborhood-complementary mixed-view graph convolutional network. The algorithm enables better adaptation to ST data at different resolutions by integrating the local information from KNN and the global structure from r-radius into a complementary neighborhood graph. It also introduces an attention mechanism to achieve adaptive fusion of different reconstructed expressions, and utilizes KPCA method for dimensionality reduction. The application of SpaNCMG on five datasets from four sequencing platforms demonstrates superior performance to eight existing advanced methods. Specifically, the algorithm achieved highest ARI accuracies of 0.63 and 0.52 on the datasets of the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and mouse somatosensory cortex, respectively. It accurately identified the spatial locations of marker genes in the mouse olfactory bulb tissue and inferred the biological functions of different regions. When handling larger datasets such as mouse embryos, the SpaNCMG not only identified the main tissue structures but also explored unlabeled domains. Overall, the good generalization ability and scalability of SpaNCMG make it an outstanding tool for understanding tissue structure and disease mechanisms.

38627939	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Attention-guided variational graph autoencoders reveal heterogeneity in spatial transcriptomics.	The latest breakthroughs in spatially resolved transcriptomics technology offer comprehensive opportunities to delve into gene expression patterns within the tissue microenvironment. However, the precise identification of spatial domains within tissues remains challenging. In this study, we introduce AttentionVGAE (AVGN), which integrates slice images, spatial information and raw gene expression while calibrating low-quality gene expression. By combining the variational graph autoencoder with multi-head attention blocks (MHA blocks), AVGN captures spatial relationships in tissue gene expression, adaptively focusing on key features and alleviating the need for prior knowledge of cluster numbers, thereby achieving superior clustering performance. Particularly, AVGN attempts to balance the model's attention focus on local and global structures by utilizing MHA blocks, an aspect that current graph neural networks have not extensively addressed. Benchmark testing demonstrates its significant efficacy in elucidating tissue anatomy and interpreting tumor heterogeneity, indicating its potential in advancing spatial transcriptomics research and understanding complex biological phenomena.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv

The advent of single-cell sequencing technologies has revolutionized cell biology studies. However, integrative analyses of diverse single-cell data face serious challenges, including technological noise, sample heterogeneity, and different modalities and species. To address these problems, we propose scCorrector, a variational autoencoder-based model that can integrate single-cell data from different studies and map them into a common space. Specifically, we designed a Study Specific Adaptive Normalization for each study in decoder to implement these features. scCorrector substantially achieves competitive and robust performance compared with state-of-the-art methods and brings novel insights under various circumstances (e.g. various batches, multi-omics, cross-species, and development stages). In addition, the integration of single-cell data and spatial data makes it possible to transfer information between different studies, which greatly expand the narrow range of genes covered by MERFISH technology. In summary, scCorrector can efficiently integrate multi-study single-cell datasets, thereby providing broad opportunities to tackle challenges emerging from noisy resources.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv

Existing RNA velocity estimation methods strongly rely on predefined dynamics and cell-agnostic constant transcriptional kinetic rates, assumptions often violated in complex and heterogeneous single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Using a graph convolution network, DeepVelo overcomes these limitations by generalizing RNA velocity to cell populations containing time-dependent kinetics and multiple lineages. DeepVelo infers time-varying cellular rates of transcription, splicing, and degradation, recovers each cell's stage in the differentiation process, and detects functionally relevant driver genes regulating these processes. Application to various developmental and pathogenic processes demonstrates DeepVelo's capacity to study complex differentiation and lineage decision events in heterogeneous scRNA-seq data.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv

Cell type identification is an indispensable analytical step in single-cell data analyses. To address the high noise stemming from gene expression data, existing computational methods often overlook the biologically meaningful relationships between genes, opting to reduce all genes to a unified data space. We assume that such relationships can aid in characterizing cell type features and improving cell type recognition accuracy. To this end, we introduce scPriorGraph, a dual-channel graph neural network that integrates multi-level gene biosemantics.

STASCAN is successfully applied across diverse datasets from different spatial transcriptomics technologies and displays significant advantages in deciphering higher-resolution cellular distribution and resolving enhanced organizational structures.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
37592036	2024	Nature biotechnology	Predicting transcriptional outcomes of novel multigene perturbations with GEARS.	Understanding cellular responses to genetic perturbation is central to numerous biomedical applications, from identifying genetic interactions involved in cancer to developing methods for regenerative medicine. However, the combinatorial explosion in the number of possible multigene perturbations severely limits experimental interrogation. Here, we present graph-enhanced gene activation and repression simulator (GEARS), a method that integrates deep learning with a knowledge graph of gene-gene relationships to predict transcriptional responses to both single and multigene perturbations using single-cell RNA-sequencing data from perturbational screens. GEARS is able to predict outcomes of perturbing combinations consisting of genes that were never experimentally perturbed. GEARS exhibited 40% higher precision than existing approaches in predicting four distinct genetic interaction subtypes in a combinatorial perturbation screen and identified the strongest interactions twice as well as prior approaches. Overall, GEARS can predict phenotypically distinct effects of multigene perturbations and thus guide the design of perturbational experiments.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
37012448	2024	Nature biotechnology	A relay velocity model infers cell-dependent RNA velocity.	RNA velocity provides an approach for inferring cellular state transitions from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Conventional RNA velocity models infer universal kinetics from all cells in an scRNA-seq experiment, resulting in unpredictable performance in experiments with multi-stage and/or multi-lineage transition of cell states where the assumption of the same kinetic rates for all cells no longer holds. Here we present cellDancer, a scalable deep neural network that locally infers velocity for each cell from its neighbors and then relays a series of local velocities to provide single-cell resolution inference of velocity kinetics. In the simulation benchmark, cellDancer shows robust performance in multiple kinetic regimes, high dropout ratio datasets and sparse datasets. We show that cellDancer overcomes the limitations of existing RNA velocity models in modeling erythroid maturation and hippocampus development. Moreover, cellDancer provides cell-specific predictions of transcription, splicing and degradation rates, which we identify as potential indicators of cell fate in the mouse pancreas.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv

Analysis of single-cell datasets generated from diverse organisms offers unprecedented opportunities to unravel fundamental evolutionary processes of conservation and diversification of cell types. However, interspecies genomic differences limit the joint analysis of cross-species datasets to homologous genes. Here we present SATURN, a deep learning method for learning universal cell embeddings that encodes genes' biological properties using protein language models. By coupling protein embeddings from language models with RNA expression, SATURN integrates datasets profiled from different species regardless of their genomic similarity. SATURN can detect functionally related genes coexpressed across species, redefining differential expression for cross-species analysis. Applying SATURN to three species whole-organism atlases and frog and zebrafish embryogenesis datasets, we show that SATURN can effectively transfer annotations across species, even when they are evolutionarily remote. We also demonstrate that SATURN can be used to find potentially divergent gene functions between glaucoma-associated genes in humans and four other species.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv

38438615	2024	Nature methods	Spatial landmark detection and tissue registration with deep learning.	Spatial landmarks are crucial in describing histological features between samples or sites, tracking regions of interest in microscopy, and registering tissue samples within a common coordinate framework. Although other studies have explored unsupervised landmark detection, existing methods are not well-suited for histological image data as they often require a large number of images to converge, are unable to handle nonlinear deformations between tissue sections and are ineffective for z-stack alignment, other modalities beyond image data or multimodal data. We address these challenges by introducing effortless landmark detection, a new unsupervised landmark detection and registration method using neural-network-guided thin-plate splines. Our proposed method is evaluated on a diverse range of datasets including histology and spatially resolved transcriptomics, demonstrating superior performance in both accuracy and stability compared to existing approaches.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
38783067	2024	Nature methods	Dependency-aware deep generative models for multitasking analysis of spatial omics data.	Spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) technologies have significantly advanced biomedical research, but their data analysis remains challenging due to the discrete nature of the data and the high levels of noise, compounded by complex spatial dependencies. Here, we propose spaVAE, a dependency-aware, deep generative spatial variational autoencoder model that probabilistically characterizes count data while capturing spatial correlations. spaVAE introduces a hybrid embedding combining a Gaussian process prior with a Gaussian prior to explicitly capture spatial correlations among spots. It then optimizes the parameters of deep neural networks to approximate the distributions underlying the SRT data. With the approximated distributions, spaVAE can contribute to several analytical tasks that are essential for SRT data analysis, including dimensionality reduction, visualization, clustering, batch integration, denoising, differential expression, spatial interpolation, resolution enhancement and identification of spatially variable genes. Moreover, we have extended spaVAE to spaPeakVAE and spaMultiVAE to characterize spatial ATAC-seq (assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing) data and spatial multi-omics data, respectively.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv

Here, we present Spatial Transcriptomics Analysis with topic Modeling to uncover spatial Patterns (STAMP), an interpretable spatially aware dimension reduction method built on a deep generative model that returns biologically relevant, low-dimensional spatial topics and associated gene modules. STAMP can analyze data ranging from a single section to multiple sections and from different technologies to time-series data, returning topics matching known biological domains and associated gene modules containing established markers highly ranked within. In a lung cancer sample, STAMP delineated cell states with supporting markers at a higher resolution than the original annotation and uncovered cancer-associated fibroblasts concentrated on the tumor edge's exterior. In time-series data of mouse embryonic development, STAMP disentangled the erythro-myeloid hematopoiesis and hepatocytes developmental trajectories within the liver. STAMP is highly scalable and can handle more than 500,000 cells.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
38907114	2024	Nature methods	Deciphering spatial domains from spatial multi-omics with SpatialGlue.	Advances in spatial omics technologies now allow multiple types of data to be acquired from the same tissue slice. To realize the full potential of such data, we need spatially informed methods for data integration.

The computational design of synthetic DNA sequences with designer in vivo properties is gaining traction in the field of synthetic genomics. We propose here a computational method which combines a kinetic Monte Carlo framework with a deep mutational screening based on deep learning predictions. We apply our method to build regular nucleosome arrays with tailored nucleosomal repeat lengths (NRL) in yeast. Our design was validated in vivo by successfully engineering and integrating thousands of kilobases long tandem arrays of computationally optimized sequences which could accommodate NRLs much larger than the yeast natural NRL (namely 197 and 237 bp, compared to the natural NRL of  approximately 165 bp). RNA-seq results show that transcription of the arrays can occur but is not driven by the NRL. The computational method proposed here delineates the key sequence rules for nucleosome positioning in yeast and should be easily applicable to other sequence properties and other genomes.

39432561	2024	PLoS computational biology	scCaT: An explainable capsulating architecture for sepsis diagnosis transferring from single-cell RNA sequencing.	Sepsis is a life-threatening condition characterized by an exaggerated immune response to pathogens, leading to organ damage and high mortality rates in the intensive care unit. Although deep learning has achieved impressive performance on prediction and classification tasks in medicine, it requires large amounts of data and lacks explainability, which hinder its application to sepsis diagnosis. We introduce a deep learning framework, called scCaT, which blends the capsulating architecture with Transformer to develop a sepsis diagnostic model using single-cell RNA sequencing data and transfers it to bulk RNA data. The capsulating architecture effectively groups genes into capsules based on biological functions, which provides explainability in encoding gene expressions. The Transformer serves as a decoder to classify sepsis patients and controls. Our model achieves high accuracy with an AUROC of 0.93 on the single-cell test set and an average AUROC of 0.98 on seven bulk RNA cohorts. Additionally, the capsules can recognize different cell types and distinguish sepsis from control samples based on their biological pathways. This study presents a novel approach for learning gene modules and transferring the model to other data types, offering potential benefits in diagnosing rare diseases with limited subjects.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
39235988	2024	PLoS computational biology	MVST: Identifying spatial domains of spatial transcriptomes from multiple views using multi-view graph convolutional networks.	Spatial transcriptome technology can parse transcriptomic data at the spatial level to detect high-throughput gene expression and preserve information regarding the spatial structure of tissues. Identifying spatial domains, that is identifying regions with similarities in gene expression and histology, is the most basic and critical aspect of spatial transcriptome data analysis. Most current methods identify spatial domains only through a single view, which may obscure certain important information and thus fail to make full use of the information embedded in spatial transcriptome data. Therefore, we propose an unsupervised clustering framework based on multiview graph convolutional networks (MVST) to achieve accurate spatial domain recognition by the learning graph embedding features of neighborhood graphs constructed from gene expression information, spatial location information, and histopathological image information through multiview graph convolutional networks. By exploring spatial transcriptomes from multiple views, MVST enables data from all parts of the spatial transcriptome to be comprehensively and fully utilized to obtain more accurate spatial expression patterns. We verified the effectiveness of MVST on real spatial transcriptome datasets, the robustness of MVST on some simulated datasets, and the reasonableness of the framework structure of MVST in ablation experiments, and from the experimental results, it is clear that MVST can achieve a more accurate spatial domain identification compared with the current more advanced methods. In conclusion, MVST is a powerful tool for spatial transcriptome research with improved spatial domain recognition.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
41028963	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Self-supervised representation learning on gene expression data.	MOTIVATION: Predicting phenotypes from gene expression data is a crucial task in biomedical research, enabling insights into disease mechanisms, drug responses, and personalized medicine. Traditional machine learning and deep learning rely on supervised learning, which requires large quantities of labeled data that are costly and time-consuming to obtain in the case of gene expression data. Self-supervised learning has recently emerged as a promising approach to overcome these limitations by extracting information directly from the structure of unlabeled data. RESULTS: In this study, we investigate the application of state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods to bulk gene expression data for phenotype prediction. We selected three self-supervised methods, based on different approaches, to assess their ability to exploit the inherent structure of the data and to generate qualitative representations which can be used for downstream predictive tasks. By using several publicly available gene expression datasets, we demonstrate how the selected methods can effectively capture complex information and improve phenotype prediction accuracy. The results obtained show that self-supervised learning methods can outperform traditional supervised models besides offering significant advantage by reducing the dependency on annotated data. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the performance of each method by highlighting their strengths and limitations. We also provide recommendations for using these methods depending on the case under study. Finally, we outline future research directions to enhance the application of self-supervised learning in the field of gene expression data analysis.

MOTIVATION: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) addresses the loss of spatial context in single-cell RNA-sequencing by simultaneously capturing gene expression and spatial location information. A critical task of ST is the identification of spatial domains. However, challenges such as high noise levels and data sparsity make the identification process more difficult. RESULTS: To tackle these challenges, STMGAMF, a multi-view graph convolutional network model that employs an adaptive adjacency matrix and a multi-strategy fusion mechanism is proposed. STMGAMF dynamically adjusts the edge weights to capture complex spatial structures during training by implementing the adaptive adjacency matrix and optimizes the embedded features through the multi-strategy fusion mechanism.

40796171	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Mitigation of multi-scale biases in cell-type deconvolution for spatially resolved transcriptomics using HarmoDecon.	MOTIVATION: The advent of spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) has revolutionized our understanding of tissue molecular microenvironments by enabling the study of gene expression in its spatial context. However, many SRT platforms lack single-cell resolution, necessitating cell-type deconvolution methods to estimate cell-type proportions in SRT spots. Despite advancements in existing tools, these methods have not addressed biases occurring at three scales: individual spots, entire tissue samples, and discrepancies between SRT and reference scRNA-seq datasets. These biases result in overbalanced cell-type proportions for each spot, mismatched cell-type fractions at the sample level, and data distribution shifts across platforms. RESULTS: To mitigate these biases, we introduce HarmoDecon, a novel semi-supervised deep learning model for spatial cell-type deconvolution. HarmoDecon leverages pseudo-spots derived from scRNA-seq data and uses Gaussian Mixture Graph Convolutional Networks to address the aforementioned issues. Through extensive simulations on multi-cell spots from STARmap and osmFISH, HarmoDecon outperformed 11 state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, when applied to legacy SRT platforms and 10x Visium datasets, HarmoDecon achieved the highest accuracy in spatial domain clustering and maintained strong correlations between cancer marker genes and cancer cells in human breast cancer samples. These results highlight the utility of HarmoDecon in advancing spatial transcriptomics analysis. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The HarmoDecon scripts, with the detailed tutorials, are available at https://github.com/ericcombiolab/HarmoDecon/tree/main.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
41288963	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scRegulate: Single-Cell Regulatory-Embedded Variational Inference of Transcription Factor Activity from Gene Expression.	MOTIVATION: Accurately inferring transcription factor (TF) activity from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data remains a fundamental challenge in computational biology. While existing methods rely on statistical models, motif enrichment, or prior-based inference, they often depend on deterministic assumptions about regulatory relationships and rely on static regulatory databases. Few approaches effectively integrate prior biological knowledge with data-driven inference to capture novel, dynamic, and context-specific regulatory interactions. RESULTS: To address these limitations, we develop scRegulate, a generative deep learning framework leveraging variational inference to estimate TF activities guided by experimental TF-target gene relationships and progressively adapted based on the input scRNA-seq data. By integrating structured biological constraints with a probabilistic latent space model, scRegulate offers a scalable and biologically grounded estimation of TF activity and gene regulatory network (GRN). Comprehensively benchmarking on public experimental and synthetic datasets demonstrates scRegulate's superior ability. Further, scRegulate accurately recapitulates experimentally validated TF knockdown effects on a Perturb-seq dataset for key TFs. Applied to experimental human PBMC scRNA-seq data, scRegulate infers cell-type-specific GRNs and identifies differentially active TFs aligned with known regulatory pathways. scRegulate's TF activity representations capture transcriptional heterogeneity, enabling accurate clustering of cell types. scRegulate is highly efficient, frequently an order of magnitude faster than common baselines. Collectively, our results establish scRegulate as a powerful, interpretable, and scalable framework for inferring TF activities and GRNs from single-cell transcriptomics.

40152244	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scMUSCL: multi-source transfer learning for clustering scRNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis relies heavily on effective clustering to facilitate numerous downstream applications. Although several machine learning methods have been developed to enhance single-cell clustering, most are fully unsupervised and overlook the rich repository of annotated datasets available from previous single-cell experiments. Since cells are inherently high-dimensional entities, unsupervised clustering can often result in clusters that lack biological relevance. Leveraging annotated scRNA-seq datasets as a reference can significantly enhance clustering performance, enabling the identification of biologically meaningful clusters in target datasets. RESULTS: In this article, we propose Single Cell MUlti-Source CLustering (scMUSCL), a novel transfer learning method designed to identify cell clusters in a target dataset by leveraging knowledge from multiple annotated reference datasets. scMUSCL employs a deep neural network to extract domain- and batch-invariant cell representations, effectively addressing discrepancies across various source datasets and between source and target datasets within the new representation space. Unlike existing methods, scMUSCL does not require prior knowledge of the number of clusters in the target dataset and eliminates the need for batch correction between source and target datasets. We conduct extensive experiments using 20 real-life datasets, demonstrating that scMUSCL consistently outperforms existing unsupervised and transfer learning-based methods. Furthermore, our experiments show that scMUSCL benefits from multiple source datasets as learning references and accurately estimates the number of clusters. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The Python implementation of scMUSCL is available at https://github.com/arashkhoeini/scMUSCL.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
40662824	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	ARTEMIS integrates autoencoders and Schrodinger Bridges to predict continuous dynamics of gene expression, cell population, and perturbation from time-series single-cell data.	"SUMMARY: Cellular processes like development, differentiation, and disease progression are highly complex and dynamic (e.g. gene expression). These processes often undergo cell population changes driven by cell birth, proliferation, and death. Single-cell sequencing enables gene expression measurement at the cellular resolution, allowing us to decipher cellular and molecular dynamics underlying these processes. However, the high costs and destructive nature of sequencing restrict observations to snapshots of unaligned cells at discrete timepoints, limiting our understanding of these processes and complicating the reconstruction of cellular trajectories. To address this challenge, we propose ARTEMIS, a generative model integrating a variational autoencoder (VAE) with unbalanced Diffusion Schrodinger Bridge to model cellular processes by reconstructing cellular trajectories, reveal gene expression dynamics, and recover cell population changes. The VAE maps input time-series single-cell data to a continuous latent space, where trajectories are reconstructed by solving the Schrodinger bridge problem using forward-backward stochastic differential equations (SDEs). A drift function in the SDEs captures deterministic gene expression trends. An additional neural network estimates time-varying kill rates for single cells along trajectories, enabling recovery of cell population changes. Using three scRNA-seq datasets-pancreatic beta-cell differentiation, zebrafish embryogenesis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells-we demonstrate that ARTEMIS: (i) outperforms state-of-art methods to predict held-out timepoints, (ii) recovers relative cell population changes over time, and (iii) identifies ""drift"" genes driving deterministic expression trends in cell trajectories. Furthermore, in silico perturbations show that these genes influence processes like EMT.

40511990	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Differentiable graph clustering with structural grouping for single-cell RNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: Clustering cells into subpopulations is one of the most crucial tasks in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis, which provides support for biological research at cellular level. With the development of graph neural networks, deep graph clustering approaches have achieved excellent performance by modeling the topological relationships between cells. However, existing approaches rely on cell node and its neighbors to obtain the cell feature representation, which ignore the graph cluster structure hidden in scRNA-seq data. Besides, how to bridge the heterogeneous gap between cell node feature and its structural information remains a highly challenging problem. RESULTS: Here, we propose a novel differentiable graph clustering with structural grouping (DGCSG) for scRNA-seq data, which incorporates graph cluster information into deep graph clustering model by designing a differentiable clustering mechanism to learn clustering-friendly representation. Firstly, an interactive module is devised to dynamically transfer node representations learned by autoencoder (AE) to graph attention autoencoder (GATE) in layer-by-layer manner. Then, to characterize graph cluster information, a differentiable clustering mechanism is proposed to transform K-way normalized cuts from a discrete optimization problem into differentiable learning objective through spectral relaxation, which jointly optimizes the GATE by allocating more attention scores to nodes in the same graph cluster. Finally, a decoupled self-supervised optimization is proposed, which guides the representation learning of AE and GATE in the interactive module. Extensive evaluations on 14 scRNA-seq benchmarks verify the superiority of DGCSG compared with state-of-the-art baselines. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The code associated with this work is available on GitHub (https://github.com/Xiaoqiang-Yan/DGCSG).	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
41324558	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Profiler: an open web platform for multi-omics analysis.	MOTIVATION: High-throughput multi-omics technologies produce increasingly large and heterogeneous datasets that are difficult to analyze without advanced computational expertise. Existing bioinformatics tools are often fragmented or limited to specific omics types, hindering reproducibility and accessibility. There is a critical need for an integrated, user-friendly, and scalable platform capable of supporting multi-omics analyses across different data modalities. RESULTS: We present Profiler, an open-source, modular platform that unifies data import, quality control, preprocessing, statistical testing, machine and deep learning, biomarker discovery, pathway and drug-target enrichment, and survival modeling within a single reproducible environment. Built in Python with Streamlit, Profiler is available as both a web-based platform deployed on high-performance computing (HPC) and a desktop version for local execution, enabling flexible usage across computational infrastructures.

40272889	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	m2ST: dual multi-scale graph clustering for spatially resolved transcriptomics.	MOTIVATION: Spatial clustering is a key analytical technique for exploring spatial transcriptomics data. Recent graph neural network-based methods have shown promise in spatial clustering but face notable challenges. One significant issue is that analyzing the functions and complex mechanisms of organisms from a single scale is difficult and most methods focus exclusively on the single-scale representation of transcriptomic data, potentially limiting the discriminative power of extracted features for spatial domain clustering. Furthermore, classical clustering algorithms are often applied directly to latent representation, making it a worthwhile endeavor to explore a tailored clustering method to further improve the accuracy of spatial domain annotation. RESULTS: To address these limitations, we propose m2ST, a novel dual multi-scale graph clustering method. m2ST first uses a multi-scale masked graph autoencoder to extract representations across different scales from spatial transcriptomic data. To effectively compress and distill meaningful knowledge embedded in the data, m2ST introduces a random masking mechanism for node features and uses a scaled cosine error as the loss function. Additionally, we introduce a tailored multi-scale clustering framework that integrates scale-common and scale-specific information exploration into the clustering process, achieving more robust annotation performance. Shannon entropy is finally utilized to dynamically adjust the importance of different scales. Extensive experiments on multiple spatial transcriptomic datasets demonstrate the superior performance of m2ST compared to existing methods.

39880378	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	SSL-VQ: vector-quantized variational autoencoders for semi-supervised prediction of therapeutic targets across diverse diseases.	MOTIVATION: Identifying effective therapeutic targets poses a challenge in drug discovery, especially for uncharacterized diseases without known therapeutic targets (e.g. rare diseases, intractable diseases). RESULTS: This study presents a novel machine learning approach using multimodal vector-quantized variational autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) for predicting therapeutic target molecules across diseases. To address the lack of known therapeutic target-disease associations, we incorporate the information on uncharacterized diseases without known targets or uncharacterized proteins without known indications (applicable diseases) in the semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework. The method integrates disease-specific and protein perturbation profiles with genetic perturbations (e.g. gene knockdowns and gene overexpressions) at the transcriptome level. Cross-cell representation learning, facilitated by VQ-VAEs, was performed to extract informative features from protein perturbation profiles across diverse human cell types. Concurrently, cross-disease representation learning was performed, leveraging VQ-VAE, to extract informative features reflecting disease states from disease-specific profiles. The model's applicability to uncharacterized diseases or proteins is enhanced by considering the consistency between disease-specific and patient-specific signatures. The efficacy of the method is demonstrated across three practical scenarios for 79 diseases: target repositioning for target-disease pairs, new target prediction for uncharacterized diseases, and new indication prediction for uncharacterized proteins. This method is expected to be valuable for identifying therapeutic targets across various diseases.

40511994	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Gene spatial integration: enhancing spatial transcriptomics analysis via deep learning and batch effect mitigation.	MOTIVATION: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is a groundbreaking technique for studying the correlation between cellular organization within a tissue and its physiological and pathological properties. Every facet of spatial information, including cell/spot proximity, distribution, and dimensionality, is significant. Most methods lean heavily on proximity for ST analysis, each resulting in useful insights but still leaving other aspects untapped. In addition, samples procured at different times, by different donors, and by different technologies introduce a batch effects problem that hinders the statistical approach employed by most analysis tools. Addressing these challenges, we have developed a deep learning method for analyzing integrated multiple ST data, focusing on the distribution aspect. Furthermore, our method aims to leverage single-cell analysis tools. RESULTS: Our study introduces Gene Spatial Integration (GSI), a data integration pipeline utilizing a representation learning approach to extract the spatial distribution of genes into the same feature space as gene expression features. We employ an autoencoder network to extract spatial embedding, facilitating the projection of spatial features into gene expression feature space. Our approach allows for seamless integration of multiple samples with minimum detriment, increasing the performance of the ST data analysis tool. We show the application of our method on the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex dataset. Our method consistently improves the performance of the clustering of Seurat tools, with the most significant increase observed in sample 151673, almost doubling the ARI score from 0.225 to 0.405. We also combine our pipeline with the clustering of GraphST, achieving a significantly higher ARI score in sample 151672 from 0.614 to 0.795. This result reveals the potential of gene distribution spatial aspect, also emphasizes the impact of integration and batch effect removal in developing a refined analysis in understanding tissue characteristics.

40569046	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	HECLIP: histology-enhanced contrastive learning for imputation of transcriptomics profiles.	MOTIVATION: Histopathology, particularly hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, is pivotal for diagnosing and characterizing pathological conditions by visualizing tissue morphology. However, H&E-stained images inherently lack molecular resolution, necessitating costly and labor-intensive technologies like spatial transcriptomics (ST) to uncover spatial gene expression patterns. There is a critical need for scalable computational methods that can bridge this imaging-transcriptomics gap. RESULTS: We present histology-enhanced contrastive learning for imputation of profiles (HECLIP), an innovative deep learning framework designed to infer spatial gene expression profiles directly from H&E-stained histology images. HECLIP employs an image-centric contrastive learning strategy to capture morphological features relevant to molecular expression. By minimizing dependence on ST data, HECLIP enables accurate and biologically meaningful predictions of gene expression. Extensive benchmarking on publicly available datasets demonstrates that HECLIP outperforms existing methods. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each model component to its overall performance.

40199763	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	ROICellTrack: a deep learning framework for integrating cellular imaging modalities in subcellular spatial transcriptomic profiling of tumor tissues.	MOTIVATION: Spatial transcriptomic (ST) technologies, such as GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler, are increasingly utilized to investigate the role of diverse tumor microenvironment components, particularly in relation to cancer progression, treatment response, and therapeutic resistance. However, in many ST studies, the spatial information obtained from immunofluorescence imaging is primarily used for identifying regions of interest (ROIs) rather than as an integral part of downstream transcriptomic data analysis and interpretation. RESULTS: We developed ROICellTrack, a deep learning-based framework that better integrates cellular imaging with spatial transcriptomic profiling. By analyzing 56 ROIs from urothelial carcinoma of the bladder and upper tract urothelial carcinoma, ROICellTrack identified distinct cancer-immune cell mixtures, characterized by specific transcriptomic and morphological signatures and receptor-ligand interactions linked to tumor content and immune infiltrations. Our findings demonstrate the value of integrating imaging with transcriptomics to analyze spatial omics data, improving our understanding of tumor heterogeneity and its relevance to personalized and targeted therapies.

40802546	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	HallmarkGraph: a cancer hallmark informed graph neural network for classifying hierarchical tumor subtypes.	MOTIVATION: Accurate tumor subtype diagnosis is crucial for precision oncology, yet current methodologies face significant challenges. These include balancing model accuracy with interpretability and the high costs of generating multi-omics data in clinical settings. Moreover, there is a lack of validated models capable of classifying hierarchical tumor subtypes across a comprehensive pan-cancer cohort. RESULTS: We present a graph neural network, HallmarkGraph, the first biologically informed model developed to classify hierarchical tumor subtypes in human cancer. Inspired by cancer hallmarks, the model's architecture integrates transcriptome profiles and gene regulatory interactions to perform multi-label classification. We evaluate the model on a comprehensive pan-cancer cohort comprising 11 476 samples from 26 primary cancers with 405 subtypes up to eight levels. The model demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving 5-fold cross-validation accuracy between 85% and 99% for tumor subtypes labeled with increasing details of genomic information. It also shows good generalizability on a validation dataset of 887 samples, assessed using three metrics that consider tumor subtypes at individual, combined, and sample levels. Benchmarking and ablation experiments show that hallmark-based embeddings slightly influence model performance, while the integrated multilayer perceptron plays a significant role in determining classifier accuracy. Additionally, we use the SHAP method to link cancer hallmarks with genes, identifying key features that influence model decisions. Our findings present a biologically informed machine learning framework capable of tracking tumor transcriptomic trajectories and distinguishing inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity in pan-cancer. This approach holds promise for enhancing cancer diagnostics.

40966654	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	AttBiomarker: unveiling preeclampsia biomarkers and molecular pathways through two-stage gene selection techniques and attention-based CNN with gene regulatory network analysis.	Preeclampsia is a complex pregnancy disorder that poses significant health risks to both mother and fetus. Despite its clinical importance, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we developed an integrative deep learning and bioinformatics approach to identify potential biomarkers for preeclampsia. Three microarray datasets related to preeclampsia were initially analyzed to select a preliminary gene subset based on $P$-values. Feature selection was then performed in two consecutive rounds: first, the Fisher score method was applied to extract significant genes, followed by the minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance method to refine the subset further. These selected gene subsets were trained using our proposed Attention-based Convolutional Neural Network (AttCNN), which achieved the highest classification accuracy compared with other models. From the experiments, a set of 58 common genes was identified between differentially expressed genes and the final optimized subset. Here, Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses highlighted key biological processes and pathways associated with preeclampsia. Subsequently, a protein-protein interaction network was constructed, identifying 10 hub genes: TSC22D1, IRF3, MME, SRSF10, SOD1, HK2, ERO1L, SH3BP5, UBC, and ZFAND5. Further analysis of gene regulatory networks, including transcription factor-gene, gene-microRNA, and drug-gene interactions, revealed that seven hub genes (HK2, SRSF10, SOD1, ERO1L, IRF3, MME, and SH3BP5) were strongly associated with preeclampsia. Molecular docking analysis showed that HK2, SH3BP5, and SOD1 exhibited significant binding affinities with two preeclampsia drugs. These findings suggest that the identified hub genes hold promise as biomarkers for early prognosis, diagnosis, and potential therapeutic targets for preeclampsia.	EST_or_microarray_records.tsv
41016009	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Identifying survival subtypes with autoencoder using multiple types of high-dimensional genomic data from studies of glioblastoma multiforme.	Analysis of multiple types of omics data facilitates a comprehensive revelation of molecular-level complexity and interactions among genomic features. This knowledge promotes the development of new therapies for treating different genomic diseases. An integrative study of multiple types of genomic data instead of a single type of genomic data will be more informative in understanding the complicated molecular activities and their interactions. In this work, we integrated RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), methylation, and DNA copy number variation data, downloaded from the TCGA public repository, of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), reduced the dimension of these high-dimensional genomic data using an autoencoder, a deep learning-based method, and then used Cox-PH model to select the autoencoder-transformed features that have a significant contribution to patient survival. We utilized the significant set of autoencoder-transformed features to classify the survival subtypes using the integrated data. We built a classification model with a penalization technique, sparse group LASSO, and evaluated the approach using cross-validation. As a result, two survival subgroups, with overall different survival profiles and linking to various genomic features, are discovered for respective GBM patients. Finally, the results are interpreted biologically by differential expression analysis and pathway analysis.	RNA-seq_records.filtered.tsv
40112338	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	REDInet: a temporal convolutional network-based classifier for A-to-I RNA editing detection harnessing million known events.

40794951	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Prioritizing pathway signature using deep learning approach: a novel strategy for traditional Chinese medicine formula generation and optimization.	The advancement of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) faces challenges, due to the absence of a deep understanding of TCM mechanism at the perspective of modern biomedical practices. This results in how TCM selects herbs to treat diseases or symptoms prevailingly rely on clinicals' experience or TCM ancient books, at least in part lacking scientific basis. Herein, we present a novel deep learning-based approach, named Negative-Correlation-based TCM Architecture for Reversal (NeCTAR), to optimize the generation and combination of TCM formulas for guiding empiric therapy, by which we could, to some degree, narrow the gap between TCM and modern biomedical science. Our approach builds on a hypothesis that pathway alterations may serve as a proxy for the corresponding physiological changes induced by a certain disease, and 'inverse-fit' those alterations would provide a feasible therapeutic strategy to treat the disease. We leveraged ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNA-seq) data with Gene Set Enrichment Analysis to establish herb-pathway associations, integrating these insights into a multilayer perceptron model that incorporates top-k sparse projection and pathway reconstruction loss to predict the most therapeutically promising herbal components. NeCTAR demonstrated high concordance with experimental data across various disease models, including fatty liver disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and premature ovarian failure. Notably, NeCTAR could equally apply to single cell RNA-seq data. Overall, our study put forwards a novel interpretive framework underlying TCM mechanisms using modern biomedical foundation, by which we could prioritize herbal components based on existing TCM formulas treating diseases.

40515392	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	scValue: value-based subsampling of large-scale single-cell transcriptomic data for machine and deep learning tasks.	Large single-cell ribonucleic acid-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets offer unprecedented biological insights but present substantial computational challenges for visualization and analysis. While existing subsampling methods can enhance efficiency, they may not ensure optimal performance in downstream machine learning and deep learning (ML/DL) tasks. Here, we introduce scValue, a novel approach that ranks individual cells by 'data value' using out-of-bag estimates from a random forest model. scValue prioritizes high-value cells and allocates greater representation to cell types with higher variability in data value, effectively preserving key biological signals within subsamples. We benchmarked scValue on automatic cell-type annotation tasks across four large datasets, paired with distinct ML/DL models. Our method consistently outperformed existing subsampling methods, closely matching full-data performance across all annotation tasks. In three additional case studies-label transfer learning, cross-study label harmonization, and bulk RNA-seq deconvolution-scValue more effectively preserved T-cell annotations across human gut-colon datasets, more accurately reproduced T-cell subtype relationships in a human spleen dataset, and constructed a more reliable single-cell immune reference for cell-type deconvolution in simulated bulk tissue samples. Finally, using 16 public datasets ranging from tens of thousands to millions of cells, we evaluated subsampling quality based on computational time, Gini coefficient, and Hausdorff distance. scValue demonstrated fast execution, well-balanced cell-type representation, and distributional properties akin to uniform sampling. Overall, scValue provides a robust and scalable solution for subsampling large scRNA-seq data in ML/DL workflows. It is available as an open-source Python package installable via pip, with source code at https://github.com/LHBCB/scvalue.	RNA-seq_records.filtered.tsv
40515391	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Gene Swin transformer: new deep learning method for colorectal cancer prognosis using transcriptomic data.	Transcriptome sequencing has become essential in clinical tumor research, providing in-depth insights into the biology and functionality of tumor cells. However, the vast amount of data generated and the complex relationships between gene expressions make it challenging to effectively identify clinically relevant information. In this study, we developed a method called Gene Swin Transformer to address these challenges. This approach converts transcriptomic data into Synthetic Image Elements (SIEs). We utilized data from 12 datasets, including GSE17536-GSE103479 datasets (n = 1771) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (n = 459), to generate SIEs. These elements were then classified based on survival time using deep learning algorithms to predict colorectal cancer prognosis and build a reliable prognostic model. We trained and evaluated four deep learning models-BeiT, ResNet, Swin Transformer, and ViT Transformer-and compared their performance. The enhanced Swin-T model outperformed the other models, achieving weighted precision, recall, and F1 scores of 0.708, 0.692, and 0.705, respectively, along with area under the curve values of 80.2%, 72.7%, and 76.9% across three datasets. This model demonstrated the strongest prognostic prediction capabilities among those evaluated. Additionally, the PEX10 gene was identified as a key prognostic marker through both visual attention matrix analysis and bioinformatics methods. Our study demonstrates that the Gene Swin model effectively transforms Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) sequencing data into SIEs, enabling prognosis prediction through attention-based algorithms. This approach supports the development of a data-driven, unified, and automated model, offering a robust tool for classification and prediction tasks using RNA sequencing data. This advancement presents a novel clinical strategy for cancer treatment and prognosis forecasting.	RNA-seq_records.filtered.tsv
40708222	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	GRANet: a graph residual attention network for gene regulatory network inference.	The reconstruction of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is crucial for uncovering regulatory relationships between genes and understanding the mechanisms of gene expression within cells. With advancements in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology, researchers have sought to infer GRNs at the single-cell level. However, existing methods primarily construct global models encompassing entire gene networks. While these approaches aim to capture genome-wide interactions, they frequently suffer from decreased accuracy due to challenges such as network scale, noise interference, and data sparsity. This study proposes GRANet (Graph Residual Attention Network), a novel deep learning framework for inferring GRNs. GRANet leverages residual attention mechanisms to adaptively learn complex gene regulatory relationships while integrating multi-dimensional biological features for a more comprehensive inference process. We evaluated GRANet across multiple datasets, benchmarking its performance against state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate that GRANet consistently outperforms existing methods in GRN inference tasks. In addition, in our case study on EGR1, CBFB, and ELF1, GRANet achieved high prediction accuracy, effectively identifying both known and novel regulatory interactions. These findings highlight GRANet's potential to advance research in gene regulation and disease mechanisms.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
40838782	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Deep clustering of single-cell RNA-seq using adversarial graph contrastive learning.	Single-cell technologies enable the exploration of biological insights at cellular resolution. One of the crucial tasks in the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data is to classify cells into groups of cell types. Recent developments in scRNA-seq clustering methods utilize the strength of contrastive learning and graph-based deep learning to learn high-quality representations which are beneficial for classifying cells. However, the unique characteristics of the scRNA-seq data still pose many computational challenges. This study proposes a novel method for clustering scRNA-seq data using adversarial graph contrastive learning, called scAGCL. The proposed algorithm creates a cell-cell graph and then generates a meaningful representation for clustering based on a contrastive learning process with the support of an adversarial attack on both the graph structures and node features. In addition, a subgraph sampling technique is used to increase the scalability of the method. Experiments on real scRNA-seq datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms seven state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, scAGCL also shows the ability to support the identification of marker genes for cell types. The source code of the proposed method and all datasets used in this paper can be downloaded at https://github.com/levinhcntt/scAGCL.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
41065243	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	scHDeepInsight: a hierarchical deep learning framework for precise immune cell annotation in single-cell RNA-seq data.	Accurate classification of immune cells is crucial for elucidating their diverse roles in health and disease. However, this task remains very challenging in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data due to the complex and hierarchical relationships of immune cell types. To address this, we introduce scHDeepInsight, a deep learning framework that extends our previous scDeepInsight model by integrating a biologically-informed classification architecture with an adaptive hierarchical focal loss (AHFL). The framework builds on our established method of converting gene expression data into two-dimensional structured images, enabling convolutional neural networks to effectively capture both global and fine-grained transcriptomic features. This design utilizes hierarchical relationships among immune cell types to enhance the classification ability beyond the flat classification approaches. scHDeepInsight dynamically adjusts loss contributions to balance performance across the hierarchy levels. Comprehensive benchmarking across seven diverse tissue datasets shows scHDeepInsight achieves an average accuracy of 93.2%, surpassing contemporary methods by 5.1 percentage points. The model successfully distinguishes 50 distinct immune cell subtypes with high accuracy, demonstrating proficiency for identifying rare and closely related cell subtypes. Additionally, SHAP-based interpretability quantifies individual gene contributions to reveal the biological basis of classification decisions.

40586320	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	An order-preserving batch-effect correction method based on a monotonic deep learning framework.	Single-cell RNA sequencing has significantly advanced our understanding of cell heterogeneity and gene regulation. Batch-effect correction is essential for achieving robust data integration. Multiple methods have been developed to address this issue, particularly procedural approaches involving components such as anchoring or deep learning, which have achieved notable successes. However, order preservation, as an important feature, has been largely overlooked in procedural methods. Based on a monotonic deep learning network, we developed a correction method with order-preserving feature. By comparing with existing methods, we demonstrated that our method effectively improved clustering performance, better retained original inter-gene correlation and differential expression information.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
40347979	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	An overview of computational methods in single-cell transcriptomic cell type annotation.	The rapid accumulation of single-cell RNA sequencing data has provided unprecedented computational resources for cell type annotation, significantly advancing our understanding of cellular heterogeneity. Leveraging gene expression profiles derived from transcriptomic data, researchers can accurately infer cell types, sparking the development of numerous innovative annotation methods.

40966644	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Graph-based deep learning for integrating single-cell and bulk transcriptomic data to identify clinical cancer subtypes.	The integration of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and bulk transcriptomic data has become essential for deciphering the complex heterogeneity of cancer and identifying clinical cancer subtypes. However, the inherent challenges posed by the high dimensionality, sparsity, and noise characteristics of scRNA-seq data have significantly hindered its widespread clinical translation. To address these limitations, we introduce single-cell and bulk transcriptomic graph deep learning, a graph-based deep learning method that synergistically integrates scRNA-seq and bulk transcriptomic data to precisely identify cancer subtypes and predict clinical outcomes. scBGDL constructs sample-specific gene graphs modeling complex gene-gene interactions and cellular relationships. The architecture employs Graph Attention Networks for feature aggregation, MinCutPool layers for dimensionality reduction, and Transformer modules to capture high-order biological dependencies. Independently validated in each of 16 distinct The Cancer Genome Atlas cancer types, scBGDL significantly outperformed existing methods in prognostic accuracy (mean C-index: 0.7060 versus 0.6709 max competitor), demonstrating robustness and generalizability to diverse transcriptional architectures. To demonstrate clinical versatility, we further evaluated scBGDL in three therapeutic contexts using multicenter cohorts: lung adenocarcinoma survival prediction (n = 1099), epithelial ovarian cancer platinum-based chemotherapy response (n = 762), skin cutaneous melanoma immunotherapy outcome (n = 305). scBGDL consistently delivered robust risk stratification (log-rank P < 0.05 across cohorts), identified key driver edges, and uncovered clinically relevant biological interpretations. By enabling multimodal data integration and interpretable biological insights, scBGDL advances precision oncology for prognosis prediction, therapy optimization, and biomarker discovery.

40439670	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	scaLR: a low-resource deep neural network-based platform for single cell analysis and biomarker discovery.	Single-cell ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing (scRNA-seq) produces vast amounts of individual cell profiling data. Its analysis presents a significant challenge in accurately annotating cell types and their associated biomarkers. Different pipelines based on deep neural network (DNN) methods have been employed to tackle these issues. These pipelines have arisen as a promising resource and can extract meaningful and concise features from noisy, diverse, and high-dimensional data to enhance annotations and subsequent analysis. Existing tools require high computational resources to execute large sample datasets. We have developed a cutting-edge platform known as scaLR (Single-cell analysis using low resource) that efficiently processes data into feature subsets, samples in batches to reduce the required memory for processing large datasets, and running DNN models in multiple central processing units. scaLR is equipped with data processing, feature extraction, training, evaluation, and downstream analysis. Its novel feature extraction algorithm first trains the model on a feature subset and stores the importance of the features for all the features in that subset. At the end of the training of all subsets, the top-K features are selected based on their importance. The final model is trained on top-K features; its performance evaluation and associated downstream analysis provide significant biomarkers for different cell types and diseases/traits. Our findings indicate that scaLR offers comparable prediction accuracy and requires less model training time and computational resources than existing Python-based pipelines. We present scaLR, a Python-based platform, engineered to utilize minimal computational resources while maintaining comparable execution times and analysis costs to existing frameworks.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
40315434	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Deep scSTAR: leveraging deep learning for the extraction and enhancement of phenotype-associated features from single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics data.	Single-cell sequencing has advanced our understanding of cellular heterogeneity and disease pathology, offering insights into cellular behavior and immune mechanisms. However, extracting meaningful phenotype-related features is challenging due to noise, batch effects, and irrelevant biological signals. To address this, we introduce Deep scSTAR (DscSTAR), a deep learning-based tool designed to enhance phenotype-associated features. DscSTAR identified HSP+ FKBP4+ T cells in CD8+ T cells, which linked to immune dysfunction and resistance to immune checkpoint blockade in non-small cell lung cancer. It has also enhanced spatial transcriptomics analysis of renal cell carcinoma, revealing interactions between cancer cells, CD8+ T cells, and tumor-associated macrophages that may promote immune suppression and affect outcomes. In hepatocellular carcinoma, it highlighted the role of S100A12+ neutrophils and cancer-associated fibroblasts in forming tumor immune barriers and potentially contributing to immunotherapy resistance. These findings demonstrate DscSTAR's capacity to model and extract phenotype-specific information, advancing our understanding of disease mechanisms and therapy resistance.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
41097818	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	PILOT-GM-VAE: patient-level analysis of single-cell disease atlas with optimal transport of Gaussian mixture variational autoencoders.	The analysis of single-cell disease atlases represents a challenge due to the presence of batch effects, low quality of disease samples, and the multiscale nature of the data, i.e. samples are described by different cell distributions. Because of these, few computational approaches are performing sample-level disease progression analysis so far. Here, we introduce Patient-Level Analysis with Optimal Transport based on Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoders (PILOT-GM-VAE). PILOT-GM-VAE explores the power of GM-VAE to estimate models describing complex single-cell distributions through efficient optimal transport algorithms for estimating the distance between Gaussian Mixtures. Extensive benchmarking on 12 single-cell disease atlases and competing approaches demonstrate the performance of PILOT-GM-VAE in sample-level clustering, sample-level trajectory inference, and batch correction tasks. Moreover, we performed a case study on a breast cancer disease atlas, where PILOT-GM-VAE highlighted cellular and molecular changes associated with breast cancer disease progression.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
40698866	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	scGGC: a two-stage strategy for single-cell clustering through cellular gene pathway construction.	In the last few years, there has been great advancement in the field of single-cell data investigation, particularly in the development of clustering methods. The advanced research is increased for the development of clustering algorithms tailored for single-cell RNA sequencing data. Conventional methods primarily focus on local relationships among cells or genes, while overlooking the global cell-gene interactions. As a result, the high dimensionality, noise, and sparsity of the data continue to pose significant challenges to clustering accuracy. To address the challenges of single-cell clustering analysis, we propose a novel single-cell clustering model, scGGC, which integrates graph autoencoders and generative adversarial network techniques. The innovations of scGGC include two components: (i) construction of an adjacency matrix that incorporates cell-cell and cell-gene relationships to capture complex interactions in a graph structure, enabling nonlinear dimensionality reduction and initial clustering via a graph autoencoder; (ii) enhancement of clustering performance by selecting high-confidence samples from the initial clusters for adversarial neural network training. A comprehensive evaluation on nine publicly available scRNA-seq datasets demonstrates that scGGC outperforms eight comparison methods. For example, on datasets such as MHC3K, the Adjusted Rand Index increases by an average of 10.1%. Furthermore, marker gene identification and cell type annotation further confirm the biological relevance of scGGC, with marker gene overlap rates exceeding 70% across multiple datasets. We conclude that scGGC not only improves the accuracy of single-cell data clustering but also enhances the identification of cell-type-specific marker genes. The scGGC code is available at https://github.com/Zhi1002/scGGC.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
40728858	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	RGCN-BA: relational graph convolutional network with batch awareness for single-cell RNA sequencing clustering.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has opened new frontiers in biomedical research, offering insights into cellular heterogeneity. Accurate cell clustering and batch effect correction are essential in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis, forming the foundation for downstream steps. However, most methods handle these tasks separately, limiting their applicability across diverse datasets. To address these challenges, we introduce Relational Graph Convolutional Network with Batch Awareness (RGCN-BA), a deep learning framework that integrates cell clustering and batch effect correction into a unified model. For multi-batch datasets, RGCN-BA leverages relational graph convolutional network to process batch information as distinct edge types, followed by a batch correction layer for global alignment. For single-batch data, it functions with a single edge type. Experiments on both multi-batch and single-batch datasets demonstrate that RGCN-BA outperforms both specialized clustering methods and batch effect correction methods. This versatility in handling both tasks positions RGCN-BA as a powerful tool for enhancing scRNA-seq data analysis.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
40062616	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Inferring gene regulatory networks from time-series scRNA-seq data via GRANGER causal recurrent autoencoders.	The development of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology provides valuable data resources for inferring gene regulatory networks (GRNs), enabling deeper insights into cellular mechanisms and diseases. While many methods exist for inferring GRNs from static scRNA-seq data, current approaches face challenges in accurately handling time-series scRNA-seq data due to high noise levels and data sparsity. The temporal dimension introduces additional complexity by requiring models to capture dynamic changes, increasing sensitivity to noise, and exacerbating data sparsity across time points. In this study, we introduce GRANGER, an unsupervised deep learning-based method that integrates multiple advanced techniques, including a recurrent variational autoencoder, GRANGER causality, sparsity-inducing penalties, and negative binomial (NB)-based loss functions, to infer GRNs. GRANGER was evaluated using multiple popular benchmarking datasets, where it demonstrated superior performance compared to eight well-known GRN inference methods. The integration of a NB-based loss function and sparsity-inducing penalties in GRANGER significantly enhanced its capacity to address dropout noise and sparsity in scRNA-seq data. Additionally, GRANGER exhibited robustness against high levels of dropout noise. We applied GRANGER to scRNA-seq data from the whole mouse brain obtained through the BRAIN Initiative project and identified GRNs for five transcription regulators: E2f7, Gbx1, Sox10, Prox1, and Onecut2, which play crucial roles in diverse brain cell types. The inferred GRNs not only recalled many known regulatory relationships but also revealed sets of novel regulatory interactions with functional potential. These findings demonstrate that GRANGER is a highly effective tool for real-world applications in discovering novel gene regulatory relationships.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
41212589	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	A machine learning framework using urinary biomarkers for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma prediction with post hoc validation via single-cell transcriptomics.	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly lethal cancer with a poor prognosis, thus emphasizing the need for early and accurate diagnostic tools. In this study, we propose a comparative study approach to understand how machine learning (ML) modeling using urinary biomarkers combined with demographic data can predict PDAC. The study also utilized a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis to assess and understand gene expressions of included biomarkers. With inclusion of available biomarkers and incorporation of demographic information, we employed different approaches for preprocessing techniques, normalization approaches, ML techniques, and deep learning (DL) approaches to provide a comprehensive prediction model. The scRNA-seq approach also highlighted the significance of the urinary biomarkers from the pancreatic single-cell sample. Based on this analysis, the marker was identified as one of the top three most highly expressed genes in PDAC tissues. The predictive modeling approach was conducted for both binary and multiclass classification using both ML and DL approaches. The comparative analysis using all included parameter combinations produced modeling settings, and among these parameters, the DL modeling approach using binary classification outperformed the other approaches by achieving 91% accuracy. This framework provided insights that highlighted the critical role of demographic data and potential approaches to include such features in the model without impacting the predictive accuracy. Future work will focus on examining the framework using different datasets, integrating additional omics data, and exploring advanced DL architectures to further improve predictive performances.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
40671174	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	scRECL: representative ensembles with contrastive learning for scRNA-seq data clustering analysis.	Single-cell transcriptomics characterizes gene expression profiles at the single-cell level, offering an unprecedented opportunity to understand cellular systems. As a fundamental task in single-cell data analysis, cell clustering significantly contributes to identifying cellular heterogeneity, thereby affecting downstream analyses. A number of deep learning methods have been proposed for clustering single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. However, the large parameter space makes these methods sensitive to parameter settings. To leverage the strong capabilities of deep learning in capturing complex structures in single-cell data while ensuring algorithmic robustness, we propose a contrastive ensemble learning method named scRECL for scRNA-seq data clustering. In our approach, Siamese neural networks are trained under various $k$-nearest neighbors partitions to obtain low-dimensional embeddings of the scRNA-seq data. Multiplex graphs in representative element selection help filter out noisy and redundant cells. Consequently, contrastive ensemble learning is performed for efficient and effective latent embedding, as well as robust analysis of cellular heterogeneity in scRNA-seq data.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
40977264	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	scHSC: enhancing single-cell RNA-seq clustering via hard sample contrastive learning.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides high-throughput information about the genome-wide gene expression levels at the single-cell resolution, bringing a precise understanding on the transcriptome of individual cells. Unfortunately, the rapidly growing scRNA-seq data and the prevalence of dropout events pose substantial challenges for clustering and cell type annotation. Here, we propose a deep learning method, scHSC, that employs hard sample mining through contrastive learning for clustering scRNA-seq data. Focusing on hard samples, this approach simultaneously integrates gene expression and topological structure information between cells to improve clustering accuracy. By adjusting the weights of hard positive and hard negative samples during the iterative training process, scHSC employs an adaptive weighting strategy to integrate contrastive learning with a ZINB model for single-cell clustering tasks. Extensive experiments on 18 single-cell RNA-seq real datasets demonstrate that scHSC exhibits significant superiority in clustering performance compared to existing deep learning-based clustering methods. scHSC is implemented in Python based on the PyTorch framework. The source code and datasets are available via https://github.com/fangs25/scHSC.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
40576031	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Evaluating discrepancies in dimensionality reduction for time-series single-cell RNA-sequencing data.	There are various dimensionality reduction techniques for visually inspecting dynamical patterns in time-series single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. However, the lack of one-to-one correspondence between cells across time points makes it difficult to uniquely uncover temporal structure in a low-dimensional manifold. The use of different techniques may thus lead to discrepancies in the representation of dynamical patterns. However, The extent of these discrepancies remains unclear. To investigate this, we propose an approach for reasoning about such discrepancies based on synthetic time-series scRNA-seq data generated by variational autoencoders. The synthetic dynamical patterns induced in a low-dimensional manifold reflect biologically plausible temporal patterns, such as dividing cell clusters during a differentiation process. We consider manifolds from different dimensionality reduction techniques, such as principal component analysis, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding, uniform manifold approximation, and projection and single-cell variational inference. We illustrate how the proposed approach allows for reasoning about to what extent low-dimensional manifolds, obtained from different techniques, can capture different dynamical patterns. None of these techniques was found to be consistently superior and the results indicate that they may not reliably represent dynamics when used in isolation, underscoring the need to compare multiple perspectives. Thus, the proposed synthetic dynamical pattern approach provides a foundation for guiding future methods development to detect complex patterns in time-series scRNA-seq data.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
40415678	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	GAEDGRN: reconstruction of gene regulatory networks based on gravity-inspired graph autoencoders.	Reconstructing high-resolution gene regulatory networks (GRNs) based on single-cell RNA sequencing data provides an opportunity to gain insight into disease pathogenesis. At present, there are a large number of GRN reconstruction methods based on graph neural networks, and they can obtain excellent performance in GRN inference by extracting network structure features. However, most of these methods fail to fully exploit the directional characteristics or even ignore them when extracting network structural features. To this end, a novel framework called GAEDGRN is proposed based on gravity-inspired graph autoencoder (GIGAE) to infer potential causal relationships between genes. Among them, GIGAE can help us capture the complex directed network topology in GRN. Additionally, due to the uneven distribution of the latent vectors generated by the graph autoencoder, a random walk-based method is used to regularize the latent vectors learnt by the encoder. Furthermore, considering that some genes in GRN usually have a significant impact on biological functions, GAEDGRN designs a gene importance score calculation method and pays attention to genes with high importance in the process of GRN reconstruction. Experimental results on seven cell types of three GRN types show that GAEDGRN achieves high accuracy and strong robustness. Moreover, a case study on human embryonic stem cells demonstrates that GAEDGRN can help identify important genes.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
40794946	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	scDCT: a conditional diffusion-based deep learning model for high-fidelity single-cell cross-modality translation.	Single-cell multi-omics technologies enable comprehensive molecular profiling, offering insights into cellular heterogeneity and biological mechanisms. However, current cross-modality translation methods struggle with high-dimensional, noisy, and sparse single-cell data. We propose single-cell Diffusion models for Cross-modality Translation (scDCT), a probabilistic framework for bidirectional cross-modality translation in single-cell data, including single-cell RNA sequencing, single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing, and protein expression. scDCT integrates modality-specific autoencoders with conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic models to map inputs to latent spaces and perform probabilistic translation across modalities. This design captures cell-type heterogeneity, accounts for data sparsity, and models uncertainty during translation. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that scDCT outperforms state-of-the-art methods across paired, unpaired, cross-type, and cross-tissue settings, offering a robust and interpretable solution for single-cell multi-omics integration.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
40366859	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Decoupled GNNs based on multi-view contrastive learning for scRNA-seq data clustering.	Clustering is pivotal in deciphering cellular heterogeneity in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. However, it suffers from several challenges in handling the high dimensionality and complexity of scRNA-seq data. Especially when employing graph neural networks (GNNs) for cell clustering, the dependencies between cells expand exponentially with the number of layers. This results in high computational complexity, negatively impacting the model's training efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach, called decoupled GNNs, based on multi-view contrastive learning (scDeGNN), for scRNA-seq data clustering. Firstly, this method constructs two adjacency matrices to generate distinct views, and trains them using decoupled GNNs to derive the initial cell feature representations. These representations are then refined through a multilayer perceptron and a contrastive learning layer, ensuring the consistency and discriminability of the learned features. Finally, the learned representations are fused and applied to the cell clustering task. Extensive experimental results on nine real scRNA-seq datasets from various organisms and tissues show that the proposed scDeGNN method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art scRNA-seq data clustering algorithms across multiple evaluation metrics.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv

The emergence of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has transformed our understanding of cellular diversity, yet it presents notable challenges for cell type annotation due to data's high dimensionality and sparsity. To tackle these issues, we present scSorterDL, an innovative approach that combines penalized Linear Discriminant Analysis (pLDA), swarm learning, and deep neural networks (DNNs) to improve cell type classification. In scSorterDL, we generate numerous random subsets of the data and apply pLDA models to each subset to capture varied data aspects. The model outputs are then consolidated using a DNN that identifies complex relationships among the pLDA scores, enhancing classification accuracy by considering interactions that simpler methods might overlook. Utilizing GPU computing for both swarm learning and deep learning, scSorterDL adeptly manages large datasets and high-dimensional gene expression data. We tested scSorterDL on 13 real scRNA-seq datasets from diverse species, tissues, and platforms, as well as on 20 pairs of cross-platform datasets. Our method surpassed nine current cell annotation tools in both accuracy and robustness, indicating exceptional performance in both cross-validation and cross-platform contexts. These findings underscore the potential of scSorterDL as an effective and adaptable tool for automated cell type annotation in scRNA-seq research. The code is available on GitHub: https://github.com/kellen8hao/scSorterDL.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
40116659	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	AttentionGRN: a functional and directed graph transformer for gene regulatory network reconstruction from scRNA-seq data.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables the reconstruction of cell type-specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs), offering detailed insights into gene regulation at high resolution. While graph neural networks have become widely used for GRN inference, their message-passing mechanisms are often limited by issues such as over-smoothing and over-squashing, which hinder the preservation of essential network structure. To address these challenges, we propose a novel graph transformer-based model, AttentionGRN, which leverages soft encoding to enhance model expressiveness and improve the accuracy of GRN inference from scRNA-seq data. Furthermore, the GRN-oriented message aggregation strategies are designed to capture both the directed network structure information and functional information inherent in GRNs. Specifically, we design directed structure encoding to facilitate the learning of directed network topologies and employ functional gene sampling to capture key functional modules and global network structure. Our extensive experiments, conducted on 88 datasets across two distinct tasks, demonstrate that AttentionGRN consistently outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, AttentionGRN has been successfully applied to reconstruct cell type-specific GRNs for human mature hepatocytes, revealing novel hub genes and previously unidentified transcription factor-target gene regulatory associations.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
40794943	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	DiffusionST: a deep generative diffusion model-based framework for enhancing spatial transcriptomics data quality and identifying spatial domains.	Recent advancements in spatial transcriptomics (ST) technology have generated substantial volumes of spatial transcriptome data. However, the quality of this data is often compromised due to the limitations of current sequencing technologies. To address this issue, DiffusionST proposes a method for imputing ST data and clustering the imputed data. The method employs a graph convolutional network model combined with a newly designed loss function, denoising data using the zero-inflated negative binomial distribution, and data enhancement through a diffusion model to improve clustering accuracy. DiffusionST demonstrates superior clustering accuracy compared to eight of the most popular ST clustering algorithms. DiffusionST also excels in data imputation when compared to five single-cell RNA sequencing imputation algorithms. Additionally, DiffusionST's robustness against noise is quantitatively validated by manually introducing random dropout noise into the dataset, where our model significantly enhances the quality of ST data. Moreover, DiffusionST is well-suited for high-resolution ST data and has been demonstrated, through survival analysis and cell-cell communication studies, to dissect spatial domains within breast cancer tissues. These findings provide strong evidence of DiffusionST's efficacy in handling ST data especially with strong noise, making it a valuable tool in this field.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
40178283	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	CoupleVAE: coupled variational autoencoders for predicting perturbational single-cell RNA sequencing data.	With the rapid advances in single-cell sequencing technology, it is now feasible to conduct in-depth genetic analysis in individual cells. Study on the dynamics of single cells in response to perturbations is of great significance for understanding the functions and behaviors of living organisms. However, the acquisition of post-perturbation cellular states via biological experiments is frequently cost-prohibitive. Predicting the single-cell perturbation responses poses a critical challenge in the field of computational biology. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning method called coupled variational autoencoders (CoupleVAE), devised to predict the postperturbation single-cell RNA-Seq data. CoupleVAE is composed of two coupled VAEs connected by a coupler, initially extracting latent features for controlled and perturbed cells via two encoders, subsequently engaging in mutual translation within the latent space through two nonlinear mappings via a coupler, and ultimately generating controlled and perturbed data by two separate decoders to process the encoded and translated features. CoupleVAE facilitates a more intricate state transformation of single cells within the latent space. Experiments in three real datasets on infection, stimulation and cross-species prediction show that CoupleVAE surpasses the existing comparative models in effectively predicting single-cell RNA-seq data for perturbed cells, achieving superior accuracy.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
40471991	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	ScInfeR: an efficient method for annotating cell types and sub-types in single-cell RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and spatial omics.	Cell-type annotation remains a major challenge in single-cell and spatial omics analysis. Most existing methods rely on single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) references or predefined marker sets. However, the scarcity of high-quality scRNA-seq references and marker sets makes relying on a single approach prone to bias and limits usability. Furthermore, available methods for cell-type annotation in single-cell ATAC-sequencing (scATAC-seq) and spatial transcriptomics datasets perform poorly. Here, we present ScInfeR, a graph-based cell-type annotation method that combines information from both scRNA-seq references and marker sets. By integrating these two data sources, ScInfeR can accurately annotate broad range of cell-types. It employs a hierarchical framework inspired by message-passing layers in graph neural networks to accurately identify cell subtypes. ScInfeR is highly versatile, supporting cell annotation across scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, and spatial omics datasets. For scATAC-seq, it effectively utilizes chromatin accessibility data, while for spatial transcriptomics, it incorporates spatial coordinate information. Additionally, ScInfeR supports weighted positive and negative markers, allowing users to define marker importance in cell-type classification. Our extensive benchmarking across multiple atlas-scale scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, and spatial datasets, evaluating 10 existing tools in over 100 cell-type prediction tasks, demonstrated ScInfeR's superior performance. Noteworthy, it exhibits robustness against batch effects arising in these datasets. To facilitate seamless annotation, we developed ScInfeRDB, an interactive database containing manually curated scRNA-seq references and marker sets for 329 cell-types, covering 2497 gene markers in 28 tissue types from human and plant. ScInfeR is available as an R package, with both the tool and database publicly accessible at https://www.swainasish.in/scinfer.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv

To address this, we present soFusion, a method for representation learning on spatial multi-omics data that enables automated identification of tissue compartmentalization. soFusion employs a graph convolutional network (GCN) to extract latent embeddings from spatial omics profiles. To simultaneously capture both cross-modality relationships and modality-specific features, we introduce a novel strategy for intra- and inter-omics feature learning. Moreover, modality-specific decoders are designed to preserve the unique information embedded in each omics type. We evaluated soFusion on multiple datasets including gene expression, protein expression, and epigenetic features. Across all benchmarks, soFusion consistently outperformed existing methods in delineating anatomical structures and identifying spatial domains with improved continuity and reduced noise. Collectively, soFusion offers an effective solution for spatial multi-omics integration, substantially enhancing the robustness of spatial domain identification.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv

Spatial transcriptomics, by capturing both gene expression and spatial information, holds great promise for unraveling the complex organization of tissues. In this study, we introduce SpaICL, an image-guided curriculum strategy-based graph contrastive learning framework for spatial transcriptomics clustering. SpaICL integrates gene expression, spatial coordinates, and histological image features to construct a low-dimensional latent representation that enhances the de-lineation of spatial functional domains. The model employs a complementary masking strategy and a shared graph neural network encoder to generate dual embeddings, while a dual cross-attention mechanism aligns local and global features across multiple modalities. Additionally, the curriculum learning module further facilitates the gradual integration of neighborhood information, effectively mitigating the over-smoothing issues associated with fixed adjacency matrices. We evaluated the performance of SpaICL on five benchmark spatial transcriptomics datasets, achieving superior results compared to existing baseline methods. Moreover, SpaICL demonstrates significant potential in downstream analytical applications.

A key hurdle in toxicity prediction lies in the heterogeneous nature of adverse health outcomes at the tissue and cellular levels, as biological processes exhibit cell-type-specific and context-dependent responses. Effective prediction of individual-level health effects thus requires the integration of multimodal data, capturing both structural and biological perturbations induced by chemical exposures. We present GenotoxNet, a multimodal deep learning framework that enhances genotoxicity prediction by systematically integrating chemical structures, high-throughput in vitro assay data, and transcriptomics data. By leveraging this multimodal integration, GenotoxNet effectively captures cellular heterogeneity and mechanistic complexity, enabling more comprehensive evaluation of chemical-induced genotoxicity. The model outperformed single-modality approaches, achieving AUCROC of 0.891 +/- 0.017 on the internal test set, demonstrating superior predictive capability over models relying solely on chemical structures or individual biological features. The model still performed well on the external chemical set. Beyond classification, GenotoxNet facilitates mechanistic interpretation by aligning multimodal feature representations of genotoxic chemicals with adverse outcome pathway (AOP). This framework not only offers a robust approach for predicting genotoxicity but also aids in the development of preventive strategies and regulatory decisions aimed at mitigating the health risks posed by hazardous chemicals.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
40052440	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	MAEST: accurately spatial domain detection in spatial transcriptomics with graph masked autoencoder.	Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technology provides gene expression profiles with spatial context, offering critical insights into cellular interactions and tissue architecture. A core task in ST is spatial domain identification, which involves detecting coherent regions with similar spatial expression patterns. However, existing methods often fail to fully exploit spatial information, leading to limited representational capacity and suboptimal clustering accuracy. Here, we introduce MAEST, a novel graph neural network model designed to address these limitations in ST data. MAEST leverages graph masked autoencoders to denoise and refine representations while incorporating graph contrastive learning to prevent feature collapse and enhance model robustness. By integrating one-hop and multi-hop representations, MAEST effectively captures both local and global spatial relationships, improving clustering precision. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets, including the human brain, mouse hippocampus, olfactory bulb, brain, and embryo, demonstrate that MAEST outperforms seven state-of-the-art methods in spatial domain identification. Furthermore, MAEST showcases its ability to integrate multi-slice data, identifying joint domains across horizontal tissue sections with high accuracy. These results highlight MAEST's versatility and effectiveness in unraveling the spatial organization of complex tissues. The source code of MAEST can be obtained at https://github.com/clearlove2333/MAEST.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
40874816	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	MuST: multiple-modality structure transformation for single-cell spatial transcriptomics.	Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies have revolutionized the study of gene expression patterns in tissues by providing multimodal data, including transcriptomic (Tra.), spatial, and morphological modalities, thereby offering new opportunities to understand tissue biology beyond traditional Tra. However, we identify the modality bias phenomenon in ST data species, i.e. the inconsistent contribution of different modalities to the labels leads to a tendency for the analysis methods to retain the information of the dominant modality. How to mitigate the adverse effects of modality bias to satisfy various downstream tasks remains a fundamental challenge. This paper introduces Multiple-modality Structure Transformation, named MuST, a novel methodology to tackle the challenge. MuST integrates the multi-modality information contained in the ST data effectively into a uniform latent space to provide a foundation for all the downstream tasks. It learns intrinsic local structures by topology discovery strategy and topology fusion loss function to solve the inconsistencies among different modalities. Thus, these topology-based and deep learning techniques provide a solid foundation for a variety of analytical tasks while coordinating different modalities. The effectiveness of MuST is assessed by performance metrics and biological significance. The results show that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods with clear advantages in the precision of identifying and preserving structures of tissues and biomarkers. MuST offers a versatile toolkit for the intricate analysis of complex biological systems.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv

40091193	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Graph neural networks for single-cell omics data: a review of approaches and applications.	Rapid advancement of sequencing technologies now allows for the utilization of precise signals at single-cell resolution in various omics studies. However, the massive volume, ultra-high dimensionality, and high sparsity nature of single-cell data have introduced substantial difficulties to traditional computational methods. The intricate non-Euclidean networks of intracellular and intercellular signaling molecules within single-cell datasets, coupled with the complex, multimodal structures arising from multi-omics joint analysis, pose significant challenges to conventional deep learning operations reliant on Euclidean geometries. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have extended deep learning to non-Euclidean data, allowing cells and their features in single-cell datasets to be modeled as nodes within a graph structure. GNNs have been successfully applied across a broad range of tasks in single-cell data analysis. In this survey, we systematically review 107 successful applications of GNNs and their six variants in various single-cell omics tasks. We begin by outlining the fundamental principles of GNNs and their six variants, followed by a systematic review of GNN-based models applied in single-cell epigenomics, transcriptomics, spatial transcriptomics, proteomics, and multi-omics. In each section dedicated to a specific omics type, we have summarized the publicly available single-cell datasets commonly utilized in the articles reviewed in that section, totaling 77 datasets. Finally, we summarize the potential shortcomings of current research and explore directions for future studies. We anticipate that this review will serve as a guiding resource for researchers to deepen the application of GNNs in single-cell omics.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
40185158	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Deep learning in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data analysis: advances and challenges from a data science perspective.	The development of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics has revolutionized our capacity to investigate cellular properties, functions, and interactions in both cellular and spatial contexts. Despite this progress, the analysis of single-cell and spatial omics data remains challenging. First, single-cell sequencing data are high-dimensional and sparse, and are often contaminated by noise and uncertainty, obscuring the underlying biological signal. Second, these data often encompass multiple modalities, including gene expression, epigenetic modifications, metabolite levels, and spatial locations. Integrating these diverse data modalities is crucial for enhancing prediction accuracy and biological interpretability. Third, while the scale of single-cell sequencing has expanded to millions of cells, high-quality annotated datasets are still limited. Fourth, the complex correlations of biological tissues make it difficult to accurately reconstruct cellular states and spatial contexts. Traditional feature engineering approaches struggle with the complexity of biological networks, while deep learning, with its ability to handle high-dimensional data and automatically identify meaningful patterns, has shown great promise in overcoming these challenges. Besides systematically reviewing the strengths and weaknesses of advanced deep learning methods, we have curated 21 datasets from nine benchmarks to evaluate the performance of 58 computational methods. Our analysis reveals that model performance can vary significantly across different benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics, providing a useful perspective for selecting the most appropriate approach based on a specific application scenario. We highlight three key areas for future development, offering valuable insights into how deep learning can be effectively applied to transcriptomic data analysis in biological, medical, and clinical settings.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
40618351	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Spatial histology and gene-expression representation and generative learning via online self-distillation contrastive learning.	Spatial transcriptomics quantifies spatial molecular profiles alongside histology, enabling computational prediction of spatial gene expression distribution directly from whole slide images. Inspired by image-to-text alignment and generation, we introduce Magic, a self-training contrastive learning model designed for histology-to-gene expression prediction. Magic (i) employs contrastive learning to derive shared embeddings for histology and gene expression while utilizing a momentum-based module to generate pseudo-targets to reduce the impact of noise; and (ii) leverages a transformer-based decoder to predict the expression of 300 genes based on histological features. Trained on 75 760 spots from 56 breast cancer slices and validated on 11 026 spots from five independent slices, Magic outperforms existing methods in aligning and generating histology-gene expression data, achieving a 10% improvement over the second-best approach. Furthermore, Magic demonstrates robust generalization, effectively predicting gene expression in colorectal cancer samples and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets through zero-shot learning. Notably, Magic's predicted gene expression captures interpatient differences, highlighting its strong potential for clinical applications.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
40698867	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Path-MGCN: a pathway activity-based multi-view graph convolutional network for determining spatial domains.	Spatial transcriptomics (ST) comprehensively measure the gene expression profiles while preserving the spatial information. Accumulated computational frameworks have been proposed to identify spatial domains, one of the fundamental tasks of ST data analysis, to understand the tissue architecture. However, current methods often overlook pathway-level functional context and struggle with data sparsity. Therefore, we develop Path-MGCN, a multi-view graph convolutional network (GCN) with attention mechanism, which integrates pathway information. We first calculate spot-level pathway activity scores via gene set variation analysis from gene expression and construct distinct adjacency graphs representing spatial and functional proximity. A multi-view GCN learns spatial, pathway, and shared embeddings adaptively fused by attention and followed by a Zero-inflated negative binomial decoder to retain the original transcriptome information. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse datasets (human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, breast cancer and mouse brain) at various resolution demonstrate Path-MGCN's superior accuracy and robustness, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods and maintaining high performance across different pathway databases (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, Gene Ontology, Reactome). Crucially, Path-MGCN enhances biological interpretability, enabling the identification of Tertiary lymphoid structure-like regions and spatially resolved metabolic heterogeneity (hypoxia, glycolysis, AMP-activated protein kinase signaling) linked to tumor progression stages in human breast cancer. By effectively integrating functional context, Path-MGCN advances ST analysis, providing an accurate and interpretable framework to dissect tissue heterogeneity and enables detailed spatial mapping of molecular pathways that highlights potential targeted therapeutic strategies crucial for developing safe and effective synergistic anti-tumor therapies.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
40608008	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	spaLLM: enhancing spatial domain analysis in multi-omics data through large language model integration.	Spatial multi-omics technologies provide valuable data on gene expression from various omics in the same tissue section while preserving spatial information. However, deciphering spatial domains within spatial omics data remains challenging due to the sparse gene expression. We propose spaLLM, the first multi-omics spatial domain analysis method that integrates large language models to enhance data representation. Our method combines a pre-trained single-cell language model (scGPT) with graph neural networks and multi-view attention mechanisms to compensate for limited gene expression information in spatial omics while improving sensitivity and resolution within modalities. SpaLLM processes multiple spatial modalities, including RNA, chromatin, and protein data, potentially adapting to emerging technologies and accommodating additional modalities. Benchmarking against eight state-of-the-art methods across four different datasets and platforms demonstrates that our model consistently outperforms other advanced methods across multiple supervised evaluation metrics.

41263938	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Accelerate the discovery of genetic variants in mitochondrial diseases with Variant prIOritization using Latent spAce.	Interpreting variants from whole-exome sequencing remains a major challenge, particularly for heterogeneous disorders such as mitochondrial diseases (MDs). To address this, we have developed Variant prIoritizatiOn using Latent spAce (VIOLA), a pipeline designed to help find a diagnosis for complex cases. VIOLA uses a variational autoencoder to embed functional annotations into a low-dimensional space, followed by DBSCAN-based outlier detection to identify potential pathogenic variants. Filtering steps and phenotype integration via HPO terms are then applied. The VIOLA score (Vscore) combines variant outlierness, transcriptomic co-expression data, and MD-specific annotations. Two rankings are derived: the VIOLA rank (all variants) and the ARrank (variants compatible with autosomal recessive inheritance). The VIOLA Aggregated score (VAscore) merges Vscore with Exomiser's pathogenicity score. Applied to 20 patients (four diagnosed), VIOLA reduced the variant list by >99% and ranked causal variants within the top 5 using ARrank, outperforming existing methods. Overall, VIOLA is a patient-specific strategy for variant prioritization, helping to resolve challenging MD cases and uncover novel disease mechanisms.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
40905789	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	stImage: a versatile framework for optimizing spatial transcriptomic analysis through customizable deep histology and location informed integration.	Spatial transcriptomics (ST) integrates gene expression data with the spatial organization of cells and their associated histology, offering unprecedented insights into tissue biology. While existing methods incorporate either location-based or histology-informed information, none fully synergize gene expression, histological features, and precise spatial coordinates within a unified framework. Moreover, these methods often exhibit inconsistent performance across diverse datasets and conditions. Here, we introduce stImage, an open-source R package that provides a comprehensive and flexible solution for ST analysis. By generating deep learning-derived histology features and offering 54 integrative strategies, stImage seamlessly combines transcriptional profiles, histology images, and spatial information.

40825238	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Reg2ST: recognizing potential patterns from gene expression for spatial transcriptomics prediction.	Spatial transcriptomics is able to acquire cellular gene expression while retaining spatial location. It is often accompanied by matched hematoxylin and eosin-stained histology whole-slide images. This retention of spatial information is critical for studying key issues in cell biology, developmental biology, neurobiology, and tumor biology. However, conventional sequencing technologies are costly and time-consuming, limiting the development of spatial transcriptomics research. Recently, deep learning methods have been widely applied to spatial transcriptomics prediction, but there are some problems in existing methods. To tackle the problem, we develop Reg2ST, a deep learning model to learn potential patterns in gene expression and apply them for spatial transcriptomics prediction. Reg2ST treats spatial transcriptomics and histology as different expressions of the same data. Contrastive learning is used to minimize the distance between them. Then image features are used to predict gene features, which aligns histology images with spatial transcriptomics. Reg2ST uses a novel way to capture relationships among spots instead of K-Nearest-Neighbors. Evaluations of Pearson correlation coefficient, statistical tests, computational efficiency using human breast cancer, and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma datasets demonstrate the superior performance of Reg2ST for spatial gene expression prediction.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
40874818	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Deep learning-driven multi-omics analysis: enhancing cancer diagnostics and therapeutics.	Artificial intelligence (AI) excels at efficiently processing large volumes of data and extracting valuable insights. Deep Learning (DL), a subfield of AI, utilizes multi-layer neural network algorithms to analyze various types of data, mimicking the neural network architecture of the human brain. One of the most prominent features of DL is its end-to-end learning mechanism, which excels at automatic feature extraction and pattern recognition in data. As multi-omics technologies rapidly evolve, the volume of omics data from cancer samples has surged, presenting a significant challenge in managing this vast amount of information. Due to its strong data processing capabilities, DL is increasingly applied across a range of cancer research areas, such as early detection and screening, diagnosis, molecular subtype classification, discovery of biomarkers, and predicting patient prognosis and treatment responses. DL integrates high-dimensional data from fields such as genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, radiomics, and single-cell omics, enhancing our understanding of cancer development and advancing personalized treatment approaches. This paper reviews various DL models and their roles in analyzing complex data patterns, providing a review of DL applications in cancer multi-omics analysis research and emphasizing its potential in early detection, diagnosis, classification, and prognosis prediction. As DL models are introduced continuously, we expect their application in cancer research to become more extensive, thus propelling the advancement of cancer medicine.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
40814229	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	DriverOmicsNet: an integrated graph convolutional network for multi-omics exploration of cancer driver genes.	Cancer is a complex and heterogeneous group of diseases driven by genetic mutations and molecular changes. Identifying and characterizing cancer driver gene is crucial for understanding cancer biology and guiding precision oncology. Integrating multi-omics data can reveal the intricate molecular interactions underlying cancer progression and treatment responses. We developed a graph convolutional network (GCN) framework, DriverOmicsNet, that integrates multi-omics data using STRING protein-protein interaction networks and correlation-based weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA). We applied this framework to 15 cancer types, analyzing 5555 tumor samples to predict cancer-related features such as homologous recombination deficiency, cancer stemness, immune clusters, tumor stage, and survival outcomes. DriverOmicsNet demonstrated superior predictive accuracy and model performance metrics across all target labels when compared with GCN models based on STRING network alone. Gene expression emerged as the most significant feature, reflecting the dynamic and functional state of cancer cells. The combined use of STRING PPI and WGCNA networks enhanced the identification of key driver genes and their interactions. Our study highlights the effectiveness of using GCNs to integrate multi-omics data for precision oncology. The integration of STRING PPI and WGCNA networks provides a comprehensive framework that improves predictive power and facilitates the understanding of cancer biology, paving the way for more tailored treatments.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
41263940	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	SciSt: single-cell reference-informed spatial gene expression prediction from pathological images.	The widespread application of spatial transcriptomics in uncovering disease mechanisms remains limited by the scarcity of samples and the high experimental costs, which have not declined substantially in recent years. Unlocking the vast resources of clinical H&E-stained images could provide an efficient and cost-effective alternative for large-scale spatial analysis. However, predicting spatial gene expression from histopathological images remains challenging, as existing end-to-end frameworks often fail to capture the intrinsic transcriptomic structures observed in real transcriptomics data. To address this, we developed SciSt, a deep learning framework that predicts spatial gene expression by integrating pathological features with biologically informed initial gene expressions. These initial expressions are generated through a weighted strategy combining cell segmentation and single-cell reference data, thereby enhancing biological interpretability. SciSt achieved state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets, outperforming the second-best models by 21.4% and 13.7%, respectively, and demonstrated robust generalization on the TCGA-BRCA and TCGA-LIHC cohorts. Beyond accurate prediction, SciSt enables cross-modal translation between morphology and gene expression, offering new avenues for mining the untapped potential of clinical image archives. This work highlights how prior biological knowledge can substantially advance the interpretability and scalability of biomedical AI models.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv

Identifying spatial domains for spatial transcriptomics is crucial for achieving comprehensive insights into the pathogenesis of gene expression. Increasingly, computational methods based on graph neural networks are being developed for spatial transcriptomics. However, previous methods have solely focused on the Euclidean manifold. To effectively exploit and explore the informative and deeper topological structures of inherent manifolds, we presented a Multi-Manifolds fusing hyperbolic graph network, balanced by Pareto optimization, for identifying spatial domains in Spatial Transcriptomics (MManiST). First, we developed multi-manifolds encoders for distinct manifolds using the hyperbolic neural network. Features from different manifolds were then combined using an attention mechanism, with multiple reconstruction losses balanced by Pareto optimization. Extensive experiments on commonly used benchmark datasets show that our method consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we investigated the validity of each component and the impact of fusion methods in ablation experiments.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv

Our approach then aligns latent spaces by leveraging data-level and model-learned similarities. We utilize this for label transfer and differential gene expression analysis in cross-species pairs of liver, adipose tissue, and glioblastoma datasets. Our results are robust even when gene sets differ, or datasets are small. Thus, we reliably exploit similarities between species to provide context for human single-cell data.

BACKGROUND: Analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data has revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity, yet current approaches face challenges in efficiency, interpretability, and connecting molecular insights to therapeutic applications. Despite advances in deep learning methods, identifying cell-type-specific functional gene sets remains difficult. RESULTS: In this study, we present scKAN, an interpretable framework for scRNA-seq analysis with two primary goals: accurate cell-type annotation and the discovery of cell-type-specific marker genes and gene sets. The key innovation is using the learnable activation curves of the Kolmogorov-Arnold network to model gene-to-cell relationships. This approach provides a more direct way to visualize and interpret these specific interactions compared to the aggregated weighting schemes typical of attention mechanisms. This architecture achieves superior performance in cell-type annotation, with a 6.63% improvement in macro F1 score over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, it enables the systematic identification of functionally coherent cell-type-specific gene sets. We demonstrate the framework's translational potential through a case study on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, where gene signatures identified by scKAN led to a potential drug repurposing candidate, whose binding stability was supported by molecular dynamics simulations. CONCLUSIONS: Our work establishes scKAN as an efficient and interpretable framework that effectively bridges single-cell analysis with drug discovery. By combining lightweight architecture with the ability to uncover nuanced biological patterns, our approach offers an interpretable method for translating large-scale single-cell data into actionable therapeutic strategies.

40973498	2025	Genome research	Deep structural clustering reveals hidden systematic biases in RNA sequencing data.	RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a pivotal tool for transcriptomic analysis, providing comprehensive exploration of gene expression across diverse biological contexts. However, RNA-seq data are susceptible to various biases that can significantly compromise the accuracy and reliability of transcript quantification. This study investigates the influence of high-dimensional RNA structures on local sequencing efficiency using an innovative unsupervised variational autoencoder-Gaussian mixture model (VAE-GMM). The VAE-GMM effectively captures intricate high-dimensional k-mer structural similarities by learning compact latent representations, which reduces dimensionality while meticulously preserving essential structural features crucial for bias identification. This sophisticated modeling allows precise tracking of local RNA-read conversion dynamics and the identification of complex, often overlooked bias sources. We rigorously validate the VAE-GMM model's performance and robustness against conventional machine learning techniques, including Gaussian mixture models (GMM-only), principal component analysis-based GMMs, k-means clustering, and hierarchical clustering. These validations, using an extensive and diverse array of data sets, including synthetic RNA constructs, various human cell lines, and authentic tissue samples, consistently demonstrate the model's superior versatility and accuracy across different biological systems. Furthermore, in silico simulations of the sequencing process closely align with actual sequencing data, strongly reinforcing the critical role of high-dimensional RNA structures in determining sequencing efficiency and their impact on data quality. Our findings offer valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of RNA structure-mediated sequencing bias. This deeper understanding enables more accurate and reliable RNA-seq analyses and is expected to improve the interpretation of transcriptomic data in future genomic studies.

38565973	2025	Nature biotechnology	The covariance environment defines cellular niches for spatial inference.	A key challenge of analyzing data from high-resolution spatial profiling technologies is to suitably represent the features of cellular neighborhoods or niches. Here we introduce the covariance environment (COVET), a representation that leverages the gene-gene covariate structure across cells in the niche to capture the multivariate nature of cellular interactions within it. We define a principled optimal transport-based distance metric between COVET niches that scales to millions of cells. Using COVET to encode spatial context, we developed environmental variational inference (ENVI), a conditional variational autoencoder that jointly embeds spatial and single-cell RNA sequencing data into a latent space. ENVI includes two decoders: one to impute gene expression across the spatial modality and a second to project spatial information onto single-cell data. ENVI can confer spatial context to genomics data from single dissociated cells and outperforms alternatives for imputing gene expression on diverse spatial datasets.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
38514799	2025	Nature biotechnology	Starfysh integrates spatial transcriptomic and histologic data to reveal heterogeneous tumor-immune hubs.	Spatially resolved gene expression profiling provides insight into tissue organization and cell-cell crosstalk; however, sequencing-based spatial transcriptomics (ST) lacks single-cell resolution. Current ST analysis methods require single-cell RNA sequencing data as a reference for rigorous interpretation of cell states, mostly do not use associated histology images and are not capable of inferring shared neighborhoods across multiple tissues. Here we present Starfysh, a computational toolbox using a deep generative model that incorporates archetypal analysis and any known cell type markers to characterize known or new tissue-specific cell states without a single-cell reference. Starfysh improves the characterization of spatial dynamics in complex tissues using histology images and enables the comparison of niches as spatial hubs across tissues. Integrative analysis of primary estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and metaplastic breast cancer (MBC) tissues led to the identification of spatial hubs with patient- and disease-specific cell type compositions and revealed metabolic reprogramming shaping immunosuppressive hubs in aggressive MBC.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
41286201	2025	Nature methods	Helixer: ab initio prediction of primary eukaryotic gene models combining deep learning and a hidden Markov model.	The accurate identification of genes is vital for understanding biological function, yet this remains challenging across many newly sequenced or less-studied species. Here we present Helixer, an artificial intelligence-based tool for ab initio gene prediction that delivers highly accurate gene models across fungal, plant, vertebrate and invertebrate genomes. Unlike traditional methods, Helixer operates without requiring additional experimental data such as RNA sequencing, making it broadly applicable to diverse species. We show that Helixer's pretrained models achieve accuracy on par with or exceeding current tools, producing gene annotations that closely match expert-curated references across multiple evaluation metrics. Its design enables immediate use on genomes without retraining, providing an efficient, accessible solution for genome annotation in both research and applied settings. The tool is available as an open-source software for local installation via GitHub. An online web interface is also available as well as through the Galaxy ToolShed.	RNA-seq_records.filtered.tsv

Here we introduce CytoTRACE 2, an interpretable deep learning framework for predicting absolute developmental potential from single-cell RNA sequencing data. Across diverse platforms and tissues, CytoTRACE 2 outperformed previous methods in predicting developmental hierarchies, enabling detailed mapping of single-cell differentiation landscapes and expanding insights into cell potency.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
39543284	2025	Nature methods	Deep learning-based models for preimplantation mouse and human embryos based on single-cell RNA sequencing.	The rapid growth of single-cell transcriptomic technology has produced an increasing number of datasets for both embryonic development and in vitro pluripotent stem cell-derived models. This avalanche of data surrounding pluripotency and the process of lineage specification has meant it has become increasingly difficult to define specific cell types or states in vivo, and compare these with in vitro differentiation. Here we utilize a set of deep learning tools to integrate and classify multiple datasets. This allows the definition of both mouse and human embryo cell types, lineages and states, thereby maximizing the information one can garner from these precious experimental resources. Our approaches are built on recent initiatives for large-scale human organ atlases, but here we focus on material that is difficult to obtain and process, spanning early mouse and human development. Using publicly available data for these stages, we test different deep learning approaches and develop a model to classify cell types in an unbiased fashion at the same time as defining the set of genes used by the model to identify lineages, cell types and states. We used our models trained on in vivo development to classify pluripotent stem cell models for both mouse and human development, showcasing the importance of this resource as a dynamic reference for early embryogenesis.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
40097811	2025	Nature methods	scNET: learning context-specific gene and cell embeddings by integrating single-cell gene expression data with protein-protein interactions.	Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) techniques have provided unprecedented insights into the heterogeneity of various tissues. However, gene expression data alone often fails to capture and identify changes in cellular pathways and complexes, as they are more discernible at the protein level. Moreover, analyzing scRNA-seq data presents further challenges due to inherent characteristics such as high noise levels and zero inflation. In this study, we propose an approach to address these limitations by integrating scRNA-seq datasets with a protein-protein interaction network. Our method utilizes a unique dual-view architecture based on graph neural networks, enabling joint representation of gene expression and protein-protein interaction network data. This approach models gene-to-gene relationships under specific biological contexts and refines cell-cell relations using an attention mechanism. Next, through comprehensive evaluations, we demonstrate that scNET better captures gene annotation, pathway characterization and gene-gene relationship identification, while improving cell clustering and pathway analysis across diverse cell types and biological conditions.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
41168487	2025	Nature methods	Nicheformer: a foundation model for single-cell and spatial omics.	Tissue makeup depends on the local cellular microenvironment. Spatial single-cell genomics enables scalable and unbiased interrogation of these interactions. Here we introduce Nicheformer, a transformer-based foundation model trained on both human and mouse dissociated single-cell and targeted spatial transcriptomics data. Pretrained on SpatialCorpus-110M, a curated collection of over 57 million dissociated and 53 million spatially resolved cells across 73 tissues on cellular reconstruction, Nicheformer learns cell representations that capture spatial context. It excels in linear-probing and fine-tuning scenarios for a newly designed set of downstream tasks, in particular spatial composition prediction and spatial label prediction. Critically, we show that models trained only on dissociated data fail to recover the complexity of spatial microenvironments, underscoring the need for multiscale integration. Nicheformer enables the prediction of the spatial context of dissociated cells, allowing the transfer of rich spatial information to scRNA-seq datasets. Overall, Nicheformer sets the stage for the next generation of machine-learning models in spatial single-cell analysis.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
41326819	2025	Nature methods	Multimodal foundation transformer models for multiscale genomics.	Transformer-based models are rapidly becoming foundational tools for analyzing and integrating multiscale biological data. This Perspective examines recent advances in transformer architectures, tracing their evolution from unimodal and augmented unimodal models to large-scale multimodal foundation models operating across genomic sequences, single-cell transcriptomics and spatial data. We categorize these models into three tiers and evaluate their capabilities for structural learning, representation transfer and tasks such as cell annotation, prediction and imputation. While discussing tokenization, interpretability and scalability challenges, we highlight emerging approaches that leverage masked modeling, contrastive learning and large language models. To support broader adoption, we provide practical guidance through code-based primers, using public datasets and open-source implementations. Finally, we propose designing a modular 'Super Transformer' architecture using cross-attention mechanisms to integrate heterogeneous modalities. This Perspective serves as a resource and roadmap for leveraging transformer models in multiscale, multimodal genomics.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
40954301	2025	Nature methods	Spatial gene expression at single-cell resolution from histology using deep learning with GHIST.	The increased use of spatially resolved transcriptomics provides new biological insights into disease mechanisms. However, the high cost and complexity of these methods are barriers to broader application. Consequently, methods have been created to predict spot-based gene expression from routinely collected histology images. Recent benchmarking showed that current methodologies have limited accuracy and spatial resolution, constraining translational capacity. Here, we introduce GHIST, a deep learning-based framework that predicts spatial gene expression at single-cell resolution by leveraging subcellular spatial transcriptomics and synergistic relationships between multiple layers of biological information. We validated GHIST using public datasets and The Cancer Genome Atlas data, demonstrating its flexibility across different spatial resolutions and superior performance. Our results underscore the utility of in silico generation of single-cell spatial gene expression measurements and the capacity to enrich existing datasets with a spatially resolved omics modality, paving the way for scalable multi-omics analysis and biomarker identification.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
39578628	2025	Nature methods	CelloType: a unified model for segmentation and classification of tissue images.	Cell segmentation and classification are critical tasks in spatial omics data analysis. Here we introduce CelloType, an end-to-end model designed for cell segmentation and classification for image-based spatial omics data. Unlike the traditional two-stage approach of segmentation followed by classification, CelloType adopts a multitask learning strategy that integrates these tasks, simultaneously enhancing the performance of both. CelloType leverages transformer-based deep learning techniques for improved accuracy in object detection, segmentation and classification. It outperforms existing segmentation methods on a variety of multiplexed fluorescence and spatial transcriptomic images. In terms of cell type classification, CelloType surpasses a model composed of state-of-the-art methods for individual tasks and a high-performance instance segmentation model. Using multiplexed tissue images, we further demonstrate the utility of CelloType for multiscale segmentation and classification of both cellular and noncellular elements in a tissue. The enhanced accuracy and multitask learning ability of CelloType facilitate automated annotation of rapidly growing spatial omics data.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
40481364	2025	Nature methods	Spotiflow: accurate and efficient spot detection for fluorescence microscopy with deep stereographic flow regression.	Identification of spot-like structures in large, noisy microscopy images is a crucial step for many life-science applications. Imaging-based spatial transcriptomics (iST), in particular, relies on the precise detection of millions of transcripts in low signal-to-noise images. Despite recent advances in computer vision, most of the currently used spot detection techniques are still based on classical signal processing and require tedious manual tuning per dataset. Here we introduce Spotiflow, a deep learning method for subpixel-accurate spot detection that formulates spot detection as a multiscale heatmap and stereographic flow regression problem. Spotiflow supports 2D and 3D images, generalizes across different imaging conditions and is more time and memory efficient than existing methods. We show the efficacy of Spotiflow by extensive quantitative experiments on diverse datasets and demonstrate that its increased accuracy leads to meaningful improvements in biological insights obtained from iST and live imaging experiments. Spotiflow is available as an easy-to-use Python library as well as a napari plugin at https://github.com/weigertlab/spotiflow .	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
39849132	2025	Nature methods	Mapping the topography of spatial gene expression with interpretable deep learning.	Spatially resolved transcriptomics technologies provide high-throughput measurements of gene expression in a tissue slice, but the sparsity of these data complicates analysis of spatial gene expression patterns. We address this issue by deriving a topographic map of a tissue slice-analogous to a map of elevation in a landscape-using a quantity called the isodepth. Contours of constant isodepths enclose domains with distinct cell type composition, while gradients of the isodepth indicate spatial directions of maximum change in expression. We develop GASTON (gradient analysis of spatial transcriptomics organization with neural networks), an unsupervised and interpretable deep learning algorithm that simultaneously learns the isodepth, spatial gradients and piecewise linear expression functions that model both continuous gradients and discontinuous variation in gene expression. We show that GASTON accurately identifies spatial domains and marker genes across several tissues, gradients of neuronal differentiation and firing in the brain, and gradients of metabolism and immune activity in the tumor microenvironment.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
40794872	2025	Nucleic acids research	Base-resolution binding profile prediction of proteins on RNAs with deep learning.	RNA-binding proteins play crucial roles in various RNA-associated biological processes, which are closely linked to cellular function and disease. Based on CLIP-seq data, the existing deep learning methods are developed to predict protein-RNA interactions. However, CLIP-seq relies on gene expression, which varies significantly across cells. Existing methods are typically trained on peak-associated binding sites and implicitly defined non-binding sites, without considering the cell-specific expression profiles. Given the dynamic nature of protein-RNA interactions, these methods struggle to accurately predict the binding nucleotides and strength of proteins on RNAs across cell lines. Therefore, this study proposes a novel deep learning-based method, iDeepB, designed to predict the proteins binding profile on RNAs at base resolution by integrating cell-line-specific gene expression profiles. iDeepB first constructs expression-aware benchmark datasets based on cell-specific RNA-seq and eCLIP-seq data, which is used to train a hybrid deep network with multi-head attention, enabling the prediction of protein binding profiles, analysis of binding motif syntax composition, and quantification of functional effects of genome mutations related to human diseases. Comprehensive evaluation on the newly developed benchmark datasets demonstrates that iDeepB outperforms existing methods in predicting protein binding profile on RNAs.	RNA-seq_records.filtered.tsv
39727154	2025	Nucleic acids research	Machine learning-optimized targeted detection of alternative splicing.	RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is widely adopted for transcriptome analysis but has inherent biases that hinder the comprehensive detection and quantification of alternative splicing. To address this, we present an efficient targeted RNA-seq method that greatly enriches for splicing-informative junction-spanning reads. Local splicing variation sequencing (LSV-seq) utilizes multiplexed reverse transcription from highly scalable pools of primers anchored near splicing events of interest. Primers are designed using Optimal Prime, a novel machine learning algorithm trained on the performance of thousands of primer sequences. In experimental benchmarks, LSV-seq achieves high on-target capture rates and concordance with RNA-seq, while requiring significantly lower sequencing depth. Leveraging deep learning splicing code predictions, we used LSV-seq to target events with low coverage in GTEx RNA-seq data and newly discover hundreds of tissue-specific splicing events. Our results demonstrate the ability of LSV-seq to quantify splicing of events of interest at high-throughput and with exceptional sensitivity.	RNA-seq_records.filtered.tsv
40057378	2025	Nucleic acids research	stAI: a deep learning-based model for missing gene imputation and cell-type annotation of spatial transcriptomics.	Spatial transcriptomics technology has revolutionized our understanding of cellular systems by capturing RNA transcript levels in their original spatial context. Single-cell spatial transcriptomics (scST) offers single-cell resolution expression level and precise spatial information of RNA transcripts, while it has a limited capacity for simultaneously detecting a wide range of RNA transcripts, hindering its broader applications. Characterizing the whole transcriptome level and comprehensively annotating cell types represent two significant challenges in scST applications. Despite several proposed methods for one or both tasks, their performance remains inadequate. In this work, we introduce stAI, a deep learning-based model designed to address both missing gene imputation and cell-type annotation for scST data. stAI leverages a joint embedding for the scST and the reference scRNA-seq data with two separate encoder-decoder modules. Both the imputation and annotation are performed within the latent space in a supervised manner, utilizing scRNA-seq data to guide the processes. Experiments for datasets generated from diverse platforms with varying numbers of measured genes were conducted and compared with the updated methods. The results demonstrate that stAI can predict the unmeasured genes, especially the marker genes, with much higher accuracy, and annotate the cell types, including those of small size, with high precision.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
40037709	2025	Nucleic acids research	Deep learning-based cell-specific gene regulatory networks inferred from single-cell multiome data.	Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) provide a global representation of how genetic/genomic information is transferred in living systems and are a key component in understanding genome regulation. Single-cell multiome data provide unprecedented opportunities to reconstruct GRNs at fine-grained resolution. However, the inference of GRNs is hindered by insufficient single omic profiles due to the characteristic high loss rate of single-cell sequencing data. In this study, we developed scMultiomeGRN, a deep learning framework to infer transcription factor (TF) regulatory networks via unique integration of single-cell genomic (single-cell RNA sequencing) and epigenomic (single-cell ATAC sequencing) data. We create scMultiomeGRN to elucidate these networks by conceptualizing TF network graph structures. Specifically, we build modality-specific neighbor aggregators and cross-modal attention modules to learn latent representations of TFs from single-cell multi-omics. We demonstrate that scMultiomeGRN outperforms state-of-the-art models on multiple benchmark datasets involved in diseases and health. Via scMultiomeGRN, we identified Alzheimer's disease-relevant regulatory network of SPI1 and RUNX1 for microglia. In summary, scMultiomeGRN offers a deep learning framework to identify cell type-specific gene regulatory network from single-cell multiome data.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
40923764	2025	Nucleic acids research	FmH2ST: foundation model-based spatial transcriptomics generation from histological images.	Spatial transcriptomics (ST) reveals gene expression distributions within tissues. Yet, predicting spatial gene expression from histological images still faces the challenges of limited ST data that lack prior knowledge, and insufficient capturing of inter-slice heterogeneity and intra-slice complexity. To tackle these challenges, we introduce FmH2ST, a foundation model-based method for spatial gene expression prediction. Equipped with powerful foundation models pretrained on massive images, FmH2ST employs a dual-branch framework to integrate prior knowledge from foundation model and fine-grained details from spot images. The foundation model branch employs a multilevel feature extraction strategy to obtain enriched features with slice context for capturing inter-slice heterogeneity, and a dual-graph strategy to obtain spatial and semantic enriched features for modeling intra-slice complexity. The spot-specific learning branch leverages multiscale convolutions, Transformer, and graph neural network to extract fine-grained spot features. The outputs of two branches are adaptively fused for better prediction under a collaborative branch learning strategy. Experimental results show FmH2ST outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets. FmH2ST can denoise the raw gene expressions, reveal cancer spatial heterogeneity and gene co-expression patterns, and support the inference of gene regulatory networks. Overall, FmH2ST is effective for predicting ST, with potential applications in clinical diagnostics and personalized treatment.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv

41337156	2025	PLoS computational biology	Epigenetics is all you need: A transformer to decode chromatin structural compartments from the epigenome.	Chromatin within the nucleus adopts complex three-dimensional structures that are crucial for gene regulation and cellular function. Recent studies have revealed the presence of distinct chromatin subcompartments beyond the traditional A/B compartments (eu- and hetero-chromatin), each exhibiting unique structural and functional properties. Here, we introduce TECSAS (Transformer of Epigenetics to Chromatin Structural AnnotationS), a deep learning model based on the Transformer architecture, designed to predict chromatin subcompartment annotations directly from epigenomic data. TECSAS leverages information from histone modifications, transcription factor binding profiles, and RNA-Seq data to decode the relationship between the biochemical composition of chromatin and its 3D structural behavior. TECSAS achieves high accuracy in predicting subcompartment annotations and reveals the influence of long-range epigenomic context on chromatin organization. Furthermore, we demonstrate the model's capability to predict the association of loci with nuclear bodies, such as the lamina, nucleoli, and speckles, providing insights into the role of these structures in shaping the 3D genome organization. This study highlights the potential of deep learning models for deciphering the complex interplay between epigenomic features and 3D genome organization, allowing us to better understand genome structure and function.

40465796	2025	PLoS computational biology	DeepDeconUQ estimates malignant cell fraction prediction intervals in bulk RNA-seq tissue.	Accurate estimation of malignant cell fractions in tissues plays a critical role in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and subsequent treatment decisions. However, most currently available methods provide only point estimates, neglecting the quantification of uncertainties, which is essential for both clinical and research applications. This study introduces DeepDeconUQ, a deep neural network model developed to estimate prediction intervals for malignant cell fractions based on bulk RNA-seq data. This approach addresses limitations in current malignant cell fraction estimation methods by integrating uncertainty quantification into predictions of cancer cell fractions. DeepDeconUQ leverages single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data in conjunction with conformalized quantile regression to produce reliable prediction intervals. The model trains a quantile regression neural network to establish upper and lower bounds for cancer cell proportions, followed by a calibration step that refines these intervals to ensure both statistical validity (coverage probability) and discrimination (narrow intervals). Benchmark analyses indicate that DeepDeconUQ consistently surpasses existing methods, achieving high coverage accuracy with tight prediction intervals across simulated and real cancer datasets. The robustness of DeepDeconUQ is further demonstrated by its resilience to various gene expression perturbations. The DeepDeconUQ method is publicly accessible at https://github.com/jiaweih14/DeepDeconUQ.	RNA-seq_records.filtered.tsv
40203060	2025	PLoS computational biology	Transcriptomic landscape around wound bed defines regenerative versus non-regenerative outcomes in mouse digit amputation.	"In the mouse distal terminal phalanx (P3), it remains mystery why amputation at less than 33% of the digit results in regeneration, while amputation exceeding 67% leads to non-regeneration. Unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying this disparity could provide crucial insights for regenerative medicine. In this study, we aim to investigate the tissues within the wound bed to understand the tissue microenvironment associated with regenerative versus non-regenerative outcomes. We employed a P3-specific amputation model in mice, integrated with time-series RNA-seq and a macrophage assay challenged with pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, to explore these mechanisms. Our findings revealed that non-regenerative digits exhibit a greater intense early transcriptional response in the wound bed compared to regenerative ones. Furthermore, early macrophage phenotypes differ distinctly between regenerative and non-regenerative outcomes. Regenerative digits also display unique co-expression modules related to Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2 (Bmp2). The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between regenerative and non-regenerative digits are enriched in targets of several transcription factors, such as HOXA11 and HOXD11 from the HOX gene family, showing a time-dependent pattern of enrichment. These transcription factors, known for their roles in bone regeneration, skeletal patterning, osteoblast activity, fracture healing, angiogenesis, and key signaling pathways, may act as master regulators of the regenerative gene signatures. Additionally, we developed a deep learning AI model capable of predicting post-amputation time and level from RNA-seq data, indicating that the regenerative probability may be ""encoded"" in the transcriptomic response to amputation."

40773517	2025	PLoS computational biology	Machine learning on multiple epigenetic features reveals H3K27Ac as a driver of gene expression prediction across patients with glioblastoma.	Epigenetic mechanisms play a crucial role in driving transcript expression and shaping the phenotypic plasticity of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), contributing to tumor heterogeneity and therapeutic resistance. These mechanisms dynamically regulate the expression of key oncogenic and stemness-associated genes, enabling GSCs to adapt to environmental cues and evade targeted therapies. Importantly, epigenetic reprogramming allows GSCs to transition between cellular states, including therapy-resistant mesenchymal-like phenotypes, underscoring the need for epigenetic-targeting strategies to disrupt these adaptive processes. Understanding these epigenetic drivers of gene expression provides a foundation for novel therapeutic interventions aimed at eradicating GSCs and improving glioblastoma outcomes. Using machine learning (ML), we employ cross-patient prediction of transcript expression in GSCs by combining epigenetic features from various sources, including ATAC-seq, CTCF ChIP-seq, RNAPII ChIP-seq, H3K27Ac ChIP-seq, and RNA-seq. We investigate different ML and deep learning (DL) models for this task and ultimately build our final pipeline using XGBoost. The model trained on one patient generalizes to other 11 patients with high performance. Notably, H3K27Ac alone from a single patient is sufficient to predict gene expression in all 11 patients. Furthermore, the distribution of H3K27Ac peaks across the genomes of all patients is remarkably similar. These findings suggest that GSCs share a common distributional pattern of enhancer activity characterized by H3K27Ac, which can be utilized to predict gene expression in GSCs across patients. In summary, while GSCs are known for their transcriptomic and phenotypic heterogeneity, we propose that they share a common epigenetic pattern of enhancer activation that defines their underlying transcriptomic expression pattern. This pattern can predict gene expression across patient samples, providing valuable insights into the biology of GSCs.	RNA-seq_records.filtered.tsv
39821189	2025	PLoS computational biology	Integration of unpaired single cell omics data by deep transfer graph convolutional network.	The rapid advance of large-scale atlas-level single cell RNA sequences and single-cell chromatin accessibility data provide extraordinary avenues to broad and deep insight into complex biological mechanism. Leveraging the datasets and transfering labels from scRNA-seq to scATAC-seq will empower the exploration of single-cell omics data. However, the current label transfer methods have limited performance, largely due to the lower capable of preserving fine-grained cell populations and intrinsic or extrinsic heterogeneity between datasets. Here, we present a robust deep transfer model based graph convolutional network, scTGCN, which achieves versatile performance in preserving biological variation, while achieving integration hundreds of thousands cells in minutes with low memory consumption. We show that scTGCN is powerful to the integration of mouse atlas data and multimodal data generated from APSA-seq and CITE-seq. Thus, scTGCN shows high label transfer accuracy and effectively knowledge transfer across different modalities.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
41183107	2025	PLoS computational biology	Branch-specific gene discovery in cell differentiation using multi-omics graph attention.	Understanding gene regulation during cell differentiation requires effective integration of multi-omics single-cell data. In this study, we propose BranchKGN, a heterogeneous graph transformer-based framework for identifying branch-specific key genes along cell differentiation trajectories. By integrating scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data into a unified gene representation, we infer differentiation trajectories using Slingshot and construct a heterogeneous graph capturing gene-cell relationships. Through attention-based graph learning, BranchKGN assigns gene importance scores within each cell, enabling the identification of genes consistently informative across branch point cells and their descendant lineages. These genes are then used to reconstruct gene regulatory networks and differentiation trajectories. Validation on three independent datasets demonstrates that the identified gene sets not only capture key regulators of cell fate bifurcation but also support accurate reconstruction of differentiation trajectories. Our results highlight the effectiveness of BranchKGN in dissecting gene regulation dynamics during cellular transitions and provide a valuable tool for multi-omics single-cell analysis.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
40184563	2025	PLoS computational biology	scTrans: Sparse attention powers fast and accurate cell type annotation in single-cell RNA-seq data.	Cell type annotation is crucial in single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis because it enables significant biological discoveries and deepens our understanding of tissue biology. Given the high-dimensional and highly sparse nature of single-cell RNA sequencing data, most existing annotation tools focus on highly variable genes to reduce dimensionality and computational load. However, this approach inevitably results in information loss, potentially weakening the model's generalization performance and adaptability to novel datasets. To mitigate this issue, we developed scTrans, a single cell Transformer-based model, which employs sparse attention to utilize all non-zero genes, thereby effectively reducing the input data dimensionality while minimizing information loss. We validated the speed and accuracy of scTrans by performing cell type annotation on 31 different tissues within the Mouse Cell Atlas. Remarkably, even with datasets nearing a million cells, scTrans efficiently perform cell type annotation in limited computational resources. Furthermore, scTrans demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, accurately annotating cells in novel datasets and generating high-quality latent representations, which are essential for precise clustering and trajectory analysis.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
40333631	2025	PLoS computational biology	scSDNE: A semi-supervised method for inferring cell-cell interactions based on graph embedding.	As a fundamental characteristic of multicellular organisms, cell-cell communication is achieved through ligand-receptor (L-R) interactions, enabling the exchange of information and revealing the diversity of biological processes and cellular functions. To gain a comprehensive understanding of these complex interaction mechanisms, we constructed a manually curated L-R interaction database and developed a semi-supervised graph embedding model called scSDNE for inferring cell-cell interactions mediated by L-R interactions. scSDNE model utilizes the power of deep learning to map genes from interacting cells into a shared latent space, allowing for a nuanced representation of their relationships. Leveraging the prior information provided by database, scSDNE can infer significant L-R pairs involved in intercellular communication. Experiments on real single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets demonstrate that our method detects interactions with a high degree of reliability compared with other methods. More importantly, the model integrates gene regulation information within cells to enhance the accuracy and biological interpretability of the inferences. Our method provides a more comprehensive view of cell-cell interactions, offering new insights into complex intercellular communication.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
39823522	2025	PLoS computational biology	BuDDI: Bulk Deconvolution with Domain Invariance to predict cell-type-specific perturbations from bulk.	While single-cell experiments provide deep cellular resolution within a single sample, some single-cell experiments are inherently more challenging than bulk experiments due to dissociation difficulties, cost, or limited tissue availability. This creates a situation where we have deep cellular profiles of one sample or condition, and bulk profiles across multiple samples and conditions. To bridge this gap, we propose BuDDI (BUlk Deconvolution with Domain Invariance). BuDDI utilizes domain adaptation techniques to effectively integrate available corpora of case-control bulk and reference scRNA-seq observations to infer cell-type-specific perturbation effects. BuDDI achieves this by learning independent latent spaces within a single variational autoencoder (VAE) encompassing at least four sources of variability: 1) cell type proportion, 2) perturbation effect, 3) structured experimental variability, and 4) remaining variability. Since each latent space is encouraged to be independent, we simulate perturbation responses by independently composing each latent space to simulate cell-type-specific perturbation responses. We evaluated BuDDI's performance on simulated and real data with experimental designs of increasing complexity. We first validated that BuDDI could learn domain invariant latent spaces on data with matched samples across each source of variability. Then we validated that BuDDI could accurately predict cell-type-specific perturbation response when no single-cell perturbed profiles were used during training; instead, only bulk samples had both perturbed and non-perturbed observations. Finally, we validated BuDDI on predicting sex-specific differences, an experimental design where it is not possible to have matched samples. In each experiment, BuDDI outperformed all other comparative methods and baselines. As more reference atlases are completed, BuDDI provides a path to combine these resources with bulk-profiled treatment or disease signatures to study perturbations, sex differences, or other factors at single-cell resolution.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
41052214	2025	PLoS computational biology	A mixture of attention experts-embedded flow-based generative model to create synthetic cells in single-cell RNA-Seq datasets.	Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNAseq) analyses performed at the cellular level aim to understand the cellular landscape of tissue sections, offer insights into rare cell-types, and identify marker genes for annotating distinct cell types. ScRNAseq analyses are widely applied to cancer research to understand tumor heterogeneity, disease progression, and resistance to therapy. Single-cell data processing is a challenging task due to its high-dimensionality, sparsity, and having imbalanced class(cell-type) distributions. An accurate cell-type identification is highly dependent on preprocessing and quality control steps. To address these issues, generative models have been widely used in recent years. Techniques frequently used include Variational Autoencoders (VAE), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Gaussian-based methods, and, more recently, Flow-based (FB) generative models. We developed a Masked Affine Autoregressive transform-embedded FB (MAF-FB) model. Then, to improve MAF-FB further, we incorporated a mixture of experts (MOE) of attention mechanisms on top of it, resulting in our proposed MOE-FB model. We conducted a comparative analysis of fundamental generative models, aiming to serve as a preliminary guidance for developing novel automated scRNAseq data analysis systems. We performed a large-scale analysis by combiningfour datasets derived from pancreatic tissue sections and for further generalizability assessments, we employed Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC68K and PBMC3K) and Human Cell Atlas Bone Marrow (HCA-BM10K) datasets. We utilized VAE, GAN, Gaussian Copula, and Automated Cell-Type-informed Introspective Variational Autoencoder (ACTIVA), and compared them against our two novel FB models, MAF-FB and MOE-FB for ScRnaseq synthesis. To evaluate the performances of generative models, we used various discrepancy metrics and performed automated cell-type classification tasks. We also identified differentially expressed genes for each cell type, and inferred cell-cell interactions based on ligand-receptor bindings across distinct cell-type pairs. Among the generative models, FB models, especially MOE-FB, consistently outperformed others across all experimental setups in both discrepancy metrics with comparison to the baseline test set and cell-type classification tasks (with an F1-score of 0.90 precision of 0.89 and recall of 0.92 for the integrated pancreatic datasets). MOE-FB produced biologically more relevant synthetic data, and ligand-receptor-based cell-cell interactions inferred from the synthetic cells closely resemble the original data, achieving an RMSE of 0.65 against the corresponding pancreatic test set. These findings highlight the potential and promising use of FB models, especially MOE-FB, in scRNAseq analyses.	scRNA-seq_records.tsv
41105750	2025	PLoS computational biology	Spatial domain identification method based on multi-view graph convolutional network and contrastive learning.	Spatial transcriptomics is a rapidly developing field of single-cell genomics that quantitatively measures gene expression while providing spatial information within tissues. A key challenge in spatial transcriptomics is identifying spatially structured domains, which involves analyzing transcriptomic data to find clusters of cells with similar expression patterns and their spatial distribution. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep-learning method called DMGCN for domain identification. The process begins with preprocessing that constructs two types of graphs: a spatial graph based on Euclidean distance and a feature graph based on Cosine distance. These graphs represent spatial positions and gene expressions, respectively. The embeddings of both graphs are generated using a multi-view graph convolutional encoder with an attention mechanism, enabling separate and co-convolution of the graphs, as well as corrupted feature convolution for contrastive learning. Finally, a fully connected network (FCN) decoder is employed to generate domain labels and reconstruct gene expressions for downstream analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that DMGCN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in various tasks, including spatial clustering, trajectory inference, and gene expression broadcasting.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
41091734	2025	PLoS computational biology	CASynergy: A causal attention model for interpretable prediction of cancer drug synergy.	Cancer drug combination therapies offer a promising strategy to overcome resistance and improve treatment efficacy, but identifying synergistic drug pairs is challenging due to complex biological interactions and tumor heterogeneity. Current machine learning algorithms for drug synergy prediction primarily rely on large-scale, multimodal datasets, yet suffer from critical limitations including poor interpretability, difficulty distinguishing causative biological relationships from correlations, and inadequate modeling of cancer-specific molecular interactions. To address these challenges, we propose CASynergy (Causal Attention and Cross-attention Synergy), a novel deep learning model for predicting cancer drug synergy that addresses limitations of prior approaches in accuracy and interpretability. CASynergy introduces a causal attention mechanism to distinguish true causal genomic features from spurious correlations, cell line-specific gene network construction to capture the unique molecular context of each cancer cell line, and a cross-attention module to integrate drug molecular features with cell line gene expression profiles. These improvements allow CASynergy to clearly identify significant drug-gene interactions and provides interpretable insights into why a combination is predicted to be synergistic. Experiments on two benchmark datasets (DrugCombDB and Oncology-Screen) suggests that CASynergy outperformed five state-of-the-art models. CASynergy offers a better and more reliable way to predict effective drug combinations. It works well across different cancer types and is easier to understand, which is important for personalized cancer treatment and finding new drugs.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
41223185	2025	PLoS computational biology	SpaMWGDA: Identifying spatial domains of spatial transcriptomes using multi-view weighted fusion graph convolutional network and data augmentation.	The rapid development of spatial transcriptomics (ST) has made it possible to effectively integrate gene expression and spatial information of cells and accurately identify spatial domains. A large number of deep learning (DL)-based methods have been proposed to perform spatial domain identification and achieved impressive results. However, these methods have some limitations. First, these methods rely on a fixed similarity metric and cannot fully utilize neighborhood information. Second, they cannot efficiently and adaptively integrate key information when fusing and reconstructing gene expression using purely additive methods. Finally, these methods ignore key nonlinear features and introduce noise during clustering. To address these limitations, we propose a novel DL model SpaMWGDA based on multi-view weighted fused graph convolutional network (GCN) and data augmentation. By modeling spatial information using different similarity metrics, the model is able to successfully capture comprehensive neighborhood information of the spot features. By combining data augmentation and contrastive learning, SpaMWGDA is able to learn key gene expressions. SpaMWGDA uses a multi-view GCN encoder to model the similarities between spatial information and gene features, and uses a view-level attention mechanism for weighted fusion to adaptively learn the dependencies between them and learn the key features of each view. Experimental results not only demonstrate that SpaMWGDA outperforms competing methods in spatial domain identification and trajectory inference but also show the ability of SpaMWGDA to analyse tissue structure and function. The source code for SpaMWGDA is available at https://github.com/nathanyl/SpaMWGDA .	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
41026788	2025	PLoS computational biology	A graph neural network-based spatial multi-omics data integration method for deciphering spatial domains.	Recent advancements of spatial sequencing technologies enable measurements of transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles within the same tissue slice, providing an unprecedented opportunity to understand cellular microenvironments. However, effective approaches for the integrative analysis of such spatial multi-omics data are lacking. Here, we propose SpaMI, a graph neural network-based model which extract features by contrastive learning strategy for each omics and integrate different omics by an attention mechanism to integrate spatial multi-omics data. We applied SpaMI to both simulated data and three real spatial multi-omics datasets derived from the same tissue slices, including spatial epigenome-transcriptome and transcriptome-proteome data. By comparing SpaMI with the state-of-the-art methods on simulation and real datasets, we demonstrate the superior performance of SpaMI in identifying spatial domain and data denoising.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
40577399	2025	PLoS computational biology	OrgaCCC: Orthogonal graph autoencoders for constructing cell-cell communication networks on spatial transcriptomics data.	Cell-cell communication (CCC) is a fundamental biological process essential for maintaining the functionality of multicellular organisms. It allows cells to coordinate their activities, sustain tissue homeostasis, and adapt to environmental changes. However, understanding the mechanisms underlying intercellular communication remains challenging. The rapid advancements in spatial transcriptomics (ST) have enabled the analysis of CCC within its spatial context. Despite the development of several computational methods for inferring CCCs from ST data, most rely on literature-curated gene or protein interaction lists, which are often inadequate due to the restricted gene coverage. In this work, we propose OrgaCCC, an orthogonal graph autoencoders approach for cell-cell communication inference based on deep generative models. OrgaCCC leverages the information of gene expression profiles, spatial locations and ligand-receptor relationships. It captures both cell/spot and gene features using two orthogonally coupled variational graph autoencoders across cell/spot and gene dimensions and combines them by maximizing the similarity between their reconstructed cell/spot features. Numerical experiments on five ST datasets demonstrate the superiority of OrgaCCC compared with state-of-the-art methods in CCC inference at the cell-type level, cell/spot level, and ligand-receptor level, in terms of inference accuracy and reliability.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
40163555	2025	PLoS computational biology	Anticancer drug response prediction integrating multi-omics pathway-based difference features and multiple deep learning techniques.	Individualized prediction of cancer drug sensitivity is of vital importance in precision medicine. While numerous predictive methodologies for cancer drug response have been proposed, the precise prediction of an individual patient's response to drug and a thorough understanding of differences in drug responses among individuals continue to pose significant challenges. This study introduced a deep learning model PASO, which integrated transformer encoder, multi-scale convolutional networks and attention mechanisms to predict the sensitivity of cell lines to anticancer drugs, based on the omics data of cell lines and the SMILES representations of drug molecules. First, we use statistical methods to compute the differences in gene expression, gene mutation, and gene copy number variations between within and outside biological pathways, and utilized these pathway difference values as cell line features, combined with the drugs' SMILES chemical structure information as inputs to the model. Then the model integrates various deep learning technologies multi-scale convolutional networks and transformer encoder to extract the properties of drug molecules from different perspectives, while an attention network is devoted to learning complex interactions between the omics features of cell lines and the aforementioned properties of drug molecules. Finally, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) outputs the final predictions of drug response. Our model exhibits higher accuracy in predicting the sensitivity to anticancer drugs comparing with other methods proposed recently. It is found that PARP inhibitors, and Topoisomerase I inhibitors were particularly sensitive to SCLC when analyzing the drug response predictions for lung cancer cell lines. Additionally, the model is capable of highlighting biological pathways related to cancer and accurately capturing critical parts of the drug's chemical structure. We also validated the model's clinical utility using clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. In summary, the PASO model suggests potential as a robust support in individualized cancer treatment. Our methods are implemented in Python and are freely available from GitHub (https://github.com/queryang/PASO).	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
40179332	2025	PLoS computational biology	SpaMask: Dual masking graph autoencoder with contrastive learning for spatial transcriptomics.	Understanding the spatial locations of cell within tissues is crucial for unraveling the organization of cellular diversity. Recent advancements in spatial resolved transcriptomics (SRT) have enabled the analysis of gene expression while preserving the spatial context within tissues. Spatial domain characterization is a critical first step in SRT data analysis, providing the foundation for subsequent analyses and insights into biological implications. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a common tool for addressing this challenge due to the structural nature of SRT data. However, current graph-based deep learning approaches often overlook the instability caused by the high sparsity of SRT data. Masking mechanisms, as an effective self-supervised learning strategy, can enhance the robustness of these models. To this end, we propose SpaMask, dual masking graph autoencoder with contrastive learning for SRT analysis. Unlike previous GNNs, SpaMask masks a portion of spot nodes and spot-to-spot edges to enhance its performance and robustness. SpaMask combines Masked Graph Autoencoders (MGAE) and Masked Graph Contrastive Learning (MGCL) modules, with MGAE using node masking to leverage spatial neighbors for improved clustering accuracy, while MGCL applies edge masking to create a contrastive loss framework that tightens embeddings of adjacent nodes based on spatial proximity and feature similarity. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of SpaMask on eight datasets from five different platforms. Compared to existing methods, SpaMask achieves superior clustering accuracy and effective batch correction.	spatial_or_multimodal_integration_records.tsv
