38486226	2024	Genome biology	Multi-omics provide insights into the regulation of DNA methylation in pear fruit metabolism.	BACKGROUND: Extensive research has been conducted on fruit development in crops, but the metabolic regulatory networks underlying perennial fruit trees remain poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the metabolome, proteome, transcriptome, DNA methylome, and small RNAome profiles of pear fruit flesh at 11 developing stages, spanning from fruitlet to ripening. Here, we systematically investigate the metabolic landscape and regulatory network involved. RESULTS: We generate an association database consisting of 439 metabolites and 14,399 genes to elucidate the gene regulatory network of pear flesh metabolism. Interestingly, we detect increased DNA methylation in the promoters of most genes within the database during pear flesh development. Application of a DNA methylation inhibitor to the developing fruit represses chlorophyll degradation in the pericarp and promotes xanthophyll, beta-carotene, and abscisic acid (ABA) accumulation in the flesh. We find the gradual increase in ABA production during pear flesh development is correlated with the expression of several carotenoid pathway genes and multiple transcription factors. Of these transcription factors, the zinc finger protein PbZFP1 is identified as a positive mediator of ABA biosynthesis in pear flesh. Most ABA pathway genes and transcription factors are modified by DNA methylation in the promoters, although some are induced by the DNA methylation inhibitor. These results suggest that DNA methylation inhibits ABA accumulation, which may delay fruit ripening. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide insights into epigenetic regulation of metabolic regulatory networks during pear flesh development, particularly with regard to DNA methylation.
37382572	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Robust joint clustering of multi-omics single-cell data via multi-modal high-order neighborhood Laplacian matrix optimization.	MOTIVATION: Simultaneous profiling of multi-omics single-cell data represents exciting technological advancements for understanding cellular states and heterogeneity. Cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing allowed for parallel quantification of cell-surface protein expression and transcriptome profiling in the same cells; methylome and transcriptome sequencing from single cells allows for analysis of transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling in the same individual cells. However, effective integration method for mining the heterogeneity of cells over the noisy, sparse, and complex multi-modal data is in growing need. RESULTS: In this article, we propose a multi-modal high-order neighborhood Laplacian matrix optimization framework for integrating the multi-omics single-cell data: scHoML. Hierarchical clustering method was presented for analyzing the optimal embedding representation and identifying cell clusters in a robust manner. This novel method by integrating high-order and multi-modal Laplacian matrices would robustly represent the complex data structures and allow for systematic analysis at the multi-omics single-cell level, thus promoting further biological discoveries.

40632608	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scMGCL: accurate and efficient integration representation of single-cell multi-omics data.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell multi-omics data integration is essential for understanding cellular states and disease mechanisms, yet integrating heterogeneous data modalities remains a challenge. We present scMGCL, a graph contrastive learning framework for robust integration of single-cell ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data. Our approach leverages self-supervised learning on cell-cell similarity graphs, in which each modality's graph structure serves as an augmentation for the other. This cross-modality contrastive paradigm enables the learning of biologically meaningful, shared representations while preserving modality-specific features. RESULTS: Benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods demonstrates that scMGCL outperforms others in cell-type clustering, label transfer accuracy, and preservation of marker-gene correlations. Additionally, scMGCL significantly improves computational efficiency, reducing runtime and memory usage. The method's effectiveness is further validated through extensive analyses of cell-type similarity and functional consistency, providing a powerful tool for multi-omics data exploration.

37941153	2023	Nucleic acids research	Probabilistic cell/domain-type assignment of spatial transcriptomics data with SpatialAnno.	In the analysis of both single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) data, classifying cells/spots into cell/domain types is an essential analytic step for many secondary analyses. Most of the existing annotation methods have been developed for scRNA-seq datasets without any consideration of spatial information. Here, we present SpatialAnno, an efficient and accurate annotation method for spatial transcriptomics datasets, with the capability to effectively leverage a large number of non-marker genes as well as 'qualitative' information about marker genes without using a reference dataset. Uniquely, SpatialAnno estimates low-dimensional embeddings for a large number of non-marker genes via a factor model while promoting spatial smoothness among neighboring spots via a Potts model. Using both simulated and four real spatial transcriptomics datasets from the 10x Visium, ST, Slide-seqV1/2, and seqFISH platforms, we showcase the method's improved spatial annotation accuracy, including its robustness to the inclusion of marker genes for irrelevant cell/domain types and to various degrees of marker gene misspecification. SpatialAnno is computationally scalable and applicable to SRT datasets from different platforms. Furthermore, the estimated embeddings for cellular biological effects facilitate many downstream analyses.
41184554	2025	Nature methods	STORIES: learning cell fate landscapes from spatial transcriptomics using optimal transport.	In dynamic biological processes such as development, spatial transcriptomics is revolutionizing the study of the mechanisms underlying spatial organization within tissues. Inferring cell fate trajectories from spatial transcriptomics profiled at several time points has thus emerged as a critical goal, requiring novel computational methods. Wasserstein gradient flow learning is a promising framework for analyzing sequencing data across time, built around a neural network representing the differentiation potential. However, existing gradient flow learning methods face challenges in analyzing spatially resolved transcriptomic data. Here, we propose STORIES, a method that uses an extension of Optimal Transport to learn a spatially informed potential. We benchmark our approach using three large Stereo-seq spatiotemporal atlases and demonstrate superior spatial coherence compared to existing approaches. Finally, we provide an in-depth analysis of axolotl neural regeneration and mouse gliogenesis, recovering gene trends for known markers such as Nptx1 in neuron regeneration and Aldh1l1 in gliogenesis and additional putative drivers.
41029754	2025	Genome biology	MOADE: a multimodal autoencoder for dissociating bulk multi-omics data.	In single cell biology, the complexity of tissues may hinder lineage cell mapping or tumor microenvironment decomposition, requiring digital dissociation of bulk tissues. Many deconvolution methods focus on transcriptomic assay, not easily applicable to other omics due to ambiguous cell markers and reference-to-target difference. Here, we present MOADE, a multimodal autoencoder pipeline linking multi-dimensional features to jointly predict personalized multi-omic profiles and cellular compositions, using pseudo-bulk data constructed by internal non-transcriptomic reference and external scRNA-seq data. MOADE is evaluated through rigorous simulation experiments and real multi-omic data from multiple tissue types, outperforming nine deconvolution pipelines with superior generalizability and fidelity.
39681325	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	scPAS: single-cell phenotype-associated subpopulation identifier.	Despite significant advancements in single-cell sequencing analysis for characterizing tissue sample heterogeneity, identifying the associations between cell subpopulations and disease phenotypes remains a challenging task. Here, we introduce scPAS, a new bioinformatics tool designed to integrate bulk data to identify phenotype-associated cell subpopulations within single-cell data. scPAS employs a network-regularized sparse regression model to quantify the association between each cell in single-cell data and a phenotype. Additionally, it estimates the significance of these associations through a permutation test, thereby identifying phenotype-associated cell subpopulations. Utilizing simulated data and various single-cell datasets from breast carcinoma, ovarian cancer, and atherosclerosis, as well as spatial transcriptomics data from multiple cancers, we demonstrated the accuracy, flexibility, and broad applicability of scPAS. Evaluations on large datasets revealed that scPAS exhibits superior operational efficiency compared to other methods. The open-source scPAS R package is available at GitHub website: https://github.com/aiminXie/scPAS.
38950180	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	SFINN: inferring gene regulatory network from single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data with shared factor neighborhood and integrated neural network.	MOTIVATION: The rise of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology presents new opportunities for constructing detailed cell type-specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs) to study cell heterogeneity. However, challenges caused by noises, technical errors, and dropout phenomena in scRNA-seq data pose significant obstacles to GRN inference, making the design of accurate GRN inference algorithms still essential. The recent growth of both single-cell and spatial transcriptomic sequencing data enables the development of supervised deep learning methods to infer GRNs on these diverse single-cell datasets. RESULTS: In this study, we introduce a novel deep learning framework based on shared factor neighborhood and integrated neural network (SFINN) for inferring potential interactions and causalities between transcription factors and target genes from single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data. SFINN utilizes shared factor neighborhood to construct cellular neighborhood network based on gene expression data and additionally integrates cellular network generated from spatial location information. Subsequently, the cell adjacency matrix and gene pair expression are fed into an integrated neural network framework consisting of a graph convolutional neural network and a fully-connected neural network to determine whether the genes interact. Performance evaluation in the tasks of gene interaction and causality prediction against the existing GRN reconstruction algorithms demonstrates the usability and competitiveness of SFINN across different kinds of data. SFINN can be applied to infer GRNs from conventional single-cell sequencing data and spatial transcriptomic data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: SFINN can be accessed at GitHub: https://github.com/JGuan-lab/SFINN.
38653489	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Single-cell multi-omics analysis identifies context-specific gene regulatory gates and mechanisms.	There is a growing interest in inferring context specific gene regulatory networks from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. This involves identifying the regulatory relationships between transcription factors (TFs) and genes in individual cells, and then characterizing these relationships at the level of specific cell types or cell states. In this study, we introduce scGATE (single-cell gene regulatory gate) as a novel computational tool for inferring TF-gene interaction networks and reconstructing Boolean logic gates involving regulatory TFs using scRNA-seq data. In contrast to current Boolean models, scGATE eliminates the need for individual formulations and likelihood calculations for each Boolean rule (e.g. AND, OR, XOR). By employing a Bayesian framework, scGATE infers the Boolean rule after fitting the model to the data, resulting in significant reductions in time-complexities for logic-based studies. We have applied assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (scATAC-seq) data and TF DNA binding motifs to filter out non-relevant TFs in gene regulations. By integrating single-cell clustering with these external cues, scGATE is able to infer context specific networks. The performance of scGATE is evaluated using synthetic and real single-cell multi-omics data from mouse tissues and human blood, demonstrating its superiority over existing tools for reconstructing TF-gene networks. Additionally, scGATE provides a flexible framework for understanding the complex combinatorial and cooperative relationships among TFs regulating target genes by inferring Boolean logic gates among them.
33971932	2021	Genome biology	SpatialDWLS: accurate deconvolution of spatial transcriptomic data.	Recent development of spatial transcriptomic technologies has made it possible to characterize cellular heterogeneity with spatial information. However, the technology often does not have sufficient resolution to distinguish neighboring cell types. Here, we present spatialDWLS, to quantitatively estimate the cell-type composition at each spatial location. We benchmark the performance of spatialDWLS by comparing it with a number of existing deconvolution methods and find that spatialDWLS outperforms the other methods in terms of accuracy and speed. By applying spatialDWLS to a human developmental heart dataset, we observe striking spatial temporal changes of cell-type composition during development.
41324558	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Profiler: an open web platform for multi-omics analysis.	MOTIVATION: High-throughput multi-omics technologies produce increasingly large and heterogeneous datasets that are difficult to analyze without advanced computational expertise. Existing bioinformatics tools are often fragmented or limited to specific omics types, hindering reproducibility and accessibility.

38579257	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Regional analysis to delineate intrasample heterogeneity with RegionalST.	MOTIVATION: Spatial transcriptomics has greatly contributed to our understanding of spatial and intra-sample heterogeneity, which could be crucial for deciphering the molecular basis of human diseases. Intra-tumor heterogeneity, e.g. may be associated with cancer treatment responses. However, the lack of computational tools for exploiting cross-regional information and the limited spatial resolution of current technologies present major obstacles to elucidating tissue heterogeneity. RESULTS: To address these challenges, we introduce RegionalST, an efficient computational method that enables users to quantify cell type mixture and interactions, identify sub-regions of interest, and perform cross-region cell type-specific differential analysis for the first time. Our simulations and real data applications demonstrate that RegionalST is an efficient tool for visualizing and analyzing diverse spatial transcriptomics data, thereby enabling accurate and flexible exploration of tissue heterogeneity. Overall, RegionalST provides a one-stop destination for researchers seeking to delve deeper into the intricacies of spatial transcriptomics data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The implementation of our method is available as an open-source R/Bioconductor package with a user-friendly manual available at https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/RegionalST.html.
39950745	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Inferring tumor purity using multi-omics data based on a uniform machine learning framework MoTP.	Existing algorithms for assessing tumor purity are limited to a single omics data, such as gene expression, somatic copy number variations, somatic mutations, and DNA methylation. Here we proposed the machine learning Multi-omics Tumor Purity prediction (MoTP) algorithm to estimate tumor purity based on multiple types of omics data. MoTP utilizes the Bayesian Regularized Neural Networks as the prediction algorithm, and Consensus Tumor Purity Estimates as labels. We trained MoTP using multi-omics data (mRNA, microRNA, long non-coding RNA, and DNA methylation) across 21 TCGA solid cancer types. By testing MoTP in TCGA validation sets, TCGA test sets, and eight datasets outside the TCGA cancer cohorts, we showed that although MoTP could achieve excellent performance in predicting tumor purity based on a single omics data type, the integration of multiple single omics data-based predictions can enhance the prediction performance. Moreover, we demonstrated the robustness of MoTP by testing it in datasets with Gaussian noise and feature missing. Benchmark analysis showed that MoTP outperformed most established tumor purity prediction algorithms, and that it required less running time and computational resource to fulfill the predictive task. Thus, MoTP would be an attractive option for computational tumor purity inference.
41206113	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Artificial intelligence in bioinformatics: a survey.	The widespread adoption of high-throughput sequencing technologies and multi-omics approaches has led to rapid accumulation of genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and even single-cell multimodal datasets, resulting in an exponential growth of biological data. The massive scale and inherent complexity of these datasets pose significant challenges for data management, analysis, and interpretation in the field of bioinformatics. Concurrently, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, particularly deep learning and reinforcement learning, have achieved groundbreaking advances in medical diagnostics, drug discovery, and genomic analyses, providing novel theoretical tools and analytical paradigms for bioinformatics research. AI techniques are now extensively applied to DNA, RNA, and protein sequence prediction and design, 3D structural elucidation, functional annotation, integrative analysis of multi-omics data, and personalized drug design for precision medicine, significantly advancing biological research. This review systematically summarizes recent research progress and representative applications of AI techniques in bioinformatics, specifically discussing suitable scenarios and advantages of traditional machine learning algorithms, deep learning models, and reinforcement learning methods. We highlight AI's transformative impact with quantitative metrics from landmark achievements: accurate near-atomic protein structure prediction (median 0.96 A on CASP14), robust single-cell modeling (AvgBIO $\approx $ 0.82), high protein design success rates (up to 92%), and sensitive cancer detection (Area Under Curve (AUC) $\approx $ 0.93). Furthermore, the paper provides an in-depth analysis of the latest advancements of AI in specific tasks, including biomedical text mining, multimodal omics integration, and single-cell analyses, while highlighting current challenges such as data noise and sparsity, difficulties in modeling long biological sequences, complexities in multimodal data integration, insufficient model interpretability, and ethical and privacy concerns. Finally, the paper outlines promising future research directions, emphasizing large-scale data mining, cross-domain model generalization, innovations in drug design and personalized medicine, and advocates for establishing an open and collaborative research ecosystem.
40254832	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	STForte: tissue context-specific encoding and consistency-aware spatial imputation for spatially resolved transcriptomics.	Encoding spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) data serves to identify the biological semantics of RNA expression within the tissue while preserving spatial characteristics. Depending on the analytical scenario, one may focus on different contextual structures of tissues. For instance, anatomical regions reveal consistent patterns by focusing on spatial homogeneity, while elucidating complex tumor micro-environments requires more expression heterogeneity. However, current spatial encoding methods lack consideration of the tissue context. Meanwhile, most developed SRT technologies are still limited in providing exact patterns of intact tissues due to limitations such as low resolution or missed measurements. Here, we propose STForte, a novel pairwise graph autoencoder-based approach with cross-reconstruction and adversarial distribution matching, to model the spatial homogeneity and expression heterogeneity of SRT data. STForte extracts interpretable latent encodings, enabling downstream analysis by accurately portraying various tissue contexts. Moreover, STForte allows spatial imputation using only spatial consistency to restore the biological patterns of unobserved locations or low-quality cells, thereby providing fine-grained views to enhance the SRT analysis. Extensive evaluations of datasets under different scenarios and SRT platforms demonstrate that STForte is a scalable and versatile tool for providing enhanced insights into spatial data analysis.
35577957	2022	Nature methods	Alignment and integration of spatial transcriptomics data.	Spatial transcriptomics (ST) measures mRNA expression across thousands of spots from a tissue slice while recording the two-dimensional (2D) coordinates of each spot. We introduce probabilistic alignment of ST experiments (PASTE), a method to align and integrate ST data from multiple adjacent tissue slices. PASTE computes pairwise alignments of slices using an optimal transport formulation that models both transcriptional similarity and physical distances between spots. PASTE further combines pairwise alignments to construct a stacked 3D alignment of a tissue. Alternatively, PASTE can integrate multiple ST slices into a single consensus slice. We show that PASTE accurately aligns spots across adjacent slices in both simulated and real ST data, demonstrating the advantages of using both transcriptional similarity and spatial information. We further show that the PASTE integrated slice improves the identification of cell types and differentially expressed genes compared with existing approaches that either analyze single ST slices or ignore spatial information.
40784921	2025	Nature methods	Co-profiling of in situ RNA-protein interactions and transcriptome in single cells and tissues.	RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are essential regulators of RNA fate and function. A long-standing challenge in studying RBP regulation has been mapping RNA interactomes within the dynamic transcriptomic landscape, especially in single-cell contexts and primary tissues. Here we introduce MAPIT-seq (modification added to RBP interacting transcript-sequencing), which uses an antibody-directed editing strategy to map genome-wide in situ RBP-RNA interactions and gene expression concurrently. We demonstrate MAPIT-seq's robustness across multiple RBPs and systematically analyze RNA substrates associated with core polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) components. MAPIT-seq is also applicable to frozen tissue sections, enabling the mapping of RBP roles during brain development. Importantly, we develop high-throughput single-cell MAPIT-seq (scMAPIT-seq) to reveal cell stage-specific RBP regulation. In summary, MAPIT-seq expands multi-omics profiling, providing an effective framework to study post-transcriptional regulation in dynamic biological processes and clinically relevant scenarios.
38493338	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Effective multi-modal clustering method via skip aggregation network for parallel scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data.	In recent years, there has been a growing trend in the realm of parallel clustering analysis for single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA) and single-cell Assay of Transposase Accessible Chromatin (scATAC) data. However, prevailing methods often treat these two data modalities as equals, neglecting the fact that the scRNA mode holds significantly richer information compared to the scATAC. This disregard hinders the model benefits from the insights derived from multiple modalities, compromising the overall clustering performance. To this end, we propose an effective multi-modal clustering model scEMC for parallel scRNA and Assay of Transposase Accessible Chromatin data. Concretely, we have devised a skip aggregation network to simultaneously learn global structural information among cells and integrate data from diverse modalities. To safeguard the quality of integrated cell representation against the influence stemming from sparse scATAC data, we connect the scRNA data with the aggregated representation via skip connection. Moreover, to effectively fit the real distribution of cells, we introduced a Zero Inflated Negative Binomial-based denoising autoencoder that accommodates corrupted data containing synthetic noise, concurrently integrating a joint optimization module that employs multiple losses. Extensive experiments serve to underscore the effectiveness of our model. This work contributes significantly to the ongoing exploration of cell subpopulations and tumor microenvironments, and the code of our work will be public at https://github.com/DayuHuu/scEMC.
39401144	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Gene expression prediction from histology images via hypergraph neural networks.	Spatial transcriptomics reveals the spatial distribution of genes in complex tissues, providing crucial insights into biological processes, disease mechanisms, and drug development. The prediction of gene expression based on cost-effective histology images is a promising yet challenging field of research. Existing methods for gene prediction from histology images exhibit two major limitations. First, they ignore the intricate relationship between cell morphological information and gene expression. Second, these methods do not fully utilize the different latent stages of features extracted from the images. To address these limitations, we propose a novel hypergraph neural network model, HGGEP, to predict gene expressions from histology images. HGGEP includes a gradient enhancement module to enhance the model's perception of cell morphological information. A lightweight backbone network extracts multiple latent stage features from the image, followed by attention mechanisms to refine the representation of features at each latent stage and capture their relations with nearby features. To explore higher-order associations among multiple latent stage features, we stack them and feed into the hypergraph to establish associations among features at different scales. Experimental results on multiple datasets from disease samples including cancers and tumor disease, demonstrate the superior performance of our HGGEP model than existing methods.
36047285	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	DEMOC: a deep embedded multi-omics learning approach for clustering single-cell CITE-seq data.	Advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies has provided an unprecedent opportunity for cell-type identification. As clustering is an effective strategy towards cell-type identification, various computational approaches have been proposed for clustering scRNA-seq data. Recently, with the emergence of cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq), the cell surface expression of specific proteins and the RNA expression on the same cell can be captured, which provides more comprehensive information for cell analysis. However, existing single cell clustering algorithms are mainly designed for single-omic data, and have difficulties in handling multi-omics data with diverse characteristics efficiently. In this study, we propose a novel deep embedded multi-omics clustering with collaborative training (DEMOC) model to perform joint clustering on CITE-seq data. Our model can take into account the characteristics of transcriptomic and proteomic data, and make use of the consistent and complementary information provided by different data sources effectively. Experiment results on two real CITE-seq datasets demonstrate that our DEMOC model not only outperforms state-of-the-art single-omic clustering methods, but also achieves better and more stable performance than existing multi-omics clustering methods. We also apply our model on three scRNA-seq datasets to assess the performance of our model in rare cell-type identification, novel cell-subtype detection and cellular heterogeneity analysis. Experiment results illustrate the effectiveness of our model in discovering the underlying patterns of data.

34165490	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	SOMDE: a scalable method for identifying spatially variable genes with self-organizing map.	MOTIVATION: Recent developments of spatial transcriptomic sequencing technologies provide powerful tools for understanding cells in the physical context of tissue microenvironments. A fundamental task in spatial gene expression analysis is to identify genes with spatially variable expression patterns, or spatially variable genes (SVgenes). Several computational methods have been developed for this task. Their high computational complexity limited their scalability to the latest and future large-scale spatial expression data. RESULTS: We present SOMDE, an efficient method for identifying SVgenes in large-scale spatial expression data. SOMDE uses self-organizing map to cluster neighboring cells into nodes, and then uses a Gaussian process to fit the node-level spatial gene expression to identify SVgenes. Experiments show that SOMDE is about 5-50 times faster than existing methods with comparable results. The adjustable resolution of SOMDE makes it the only method that can give results in  approximately 5 min in large datasets of more than 20 000 sequencing sites. SOMDE is available as a python package on PyPI at https://pypi.org/project/somde free for academic use. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: SOMDE is available for download from PyPI, and the source code is openly available from the Github repository https://github.com/XuegongLab/somde.

36243980	2022	Nucleic acids research	Integrated multi-omics approach revealed cellular senescence landscape.	Cellular senescence is a complex multifactorial biological phenomenon that plays essential roles in aging, and aging-related diseases. During this process, the senescent cells undergo gene expression altering and chromatin structure remodeling. However, studies on the epigenetic landscape of senescence using integrated multi-omics approaches are limited. In this research, we performed ATAC-seq, RNA-seq and ChIP-seq on different senescent types to reveal the landscape of senescence and identify the prime regulatory elements. We also obtained 34 key genes and deduced that NAT1, PBX1 and RRM2, which interacted with each other, could be the potential markers of aging and aging-related diseases. In summary, our work provides the landscape to study accessibility dynamics and transcriptional regulations in cellular senescence. The application of this technique in different types of senescence allows us to identify the regulatory elements responsible for the substantial regulation of transcription, providing the insights into molecular mechanisms of senescence.
27525975	2016	Nature methods	Single-cell multimodal profiling reveals cellular epigenetic heterogeneity.	Sample heterogeneity often masks DNA methylation signatures in subpopulations of cells. Here, we present a method to genotype single cells while simultaneously interrogating gene expression and DNA methylation at multiple loci. We used this targeted multimodal approach, implemented on an automated, high-throughput microfluidic platform, to assess primary lung adenocarcinomas and human fibroblasts undergoing reprogramming by profiling epigenetic variation among cell types identified through genotyping and transcriptional analysis.
31501547	2019	Nature methods	High-definition spatial transcriptomics for in situ tissue profiling.	Spatial and molecular characteristics determine tissue function, yet high-resolution methods to capture both concurrently are lacking. Here, we developed high-definition spatial transcriptomics, which captures RNA from histological tissue sections on a dense, spatially barcoded bead array. Each experiment recovers several hundred thousand transcript-coupled spatial barcodes at 2-mum resolution, as demonstrated in mouse brain and primary breast cancer. This opens the way to high-resolution spatial analysis of cells and tissues.
40568931	2025	Nucleic acids research	A comprehensive review of spatial transcriptomics data alignment and integration.	Spatial data acquisition technologies enable high-throughput quantification of molecular expression in tissue sections maintaining spatial context information. However, performing downstream analysis on a whole tissue section requires the alignment and integration of multiple tissue slices. This is a nontrivial task due to tissue heterogeneity and plasticity. Although manual solutions exist, they are time-consuming and require technical expertise. Hence, automated and robust alignment and integration of multiple slices within and across datasets, individuals, and experiments becomes essential. This study aims to (i) present a comprehensive review of methodologies for spatial transcriptomics (ST) data alignment and integration, (ii) explain the problem, its scope and challenges, and (iii) propose a general pipeline. We review 24 tools addressing multi-slice ST alignment and integration, and tackling key challenges through downstream validation. Tools focusing solely on single-slice ST analyses or multi-omics integration are excluded. We categorize these approaches by methodology (statistical mapping, image processing and registration, and graph-based) in accordance with the generalized pipeline. We evaluate their strengths, limitations, and real-world applications based on task scope and their potential to advance biological insights. Despite improved spatial resolution and 3D tissue reconstruction, significant challenges persist in achieving robust alignment and integration across heterogeneous tissue slices.
40401350	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Multicancer analyses of short tandem repeat variations reveal shared gene regulatory mechanisms.	Short tandem repeats (STRs) have been reported to influence gene expression across various human tissues. While STR variations are enriched in colorectal, stomach, and endometrial cancers, particularly in microsatellite instable tumors, their functional effects and regulatory mechanisms on gene expression remain poorly understood across these cancer types. Here, we leverage whole-exome sequencing and gene expression data to identify STRs for which repeat lengths are associated with the expression of nearby genes (eSTRs) in colorectal, stomach, and endometrial tumors. While most eSTRs are cancer-specific, shared eSTRs across multiple cancers exhibit consistent effects on gene expression. Notably, coding-region eSTRs identified in all three cancer types show positive correlations with nearby gene expression. We further validate the functional effects of eSTRs by demonstrating associations between somatic eSTR mutations and gene expression changes during the transition from normal to tumor tissues, suggesting their potential roles in tumorigenesis. Combined with DNA methylation data, we perform the first quantitative analysis of the interplay between STR variations and DNA methylation in tumors. We identify eSTRs where repeat lengths are associated with methylation levels of nearby CpG sites (meSTRs) and show that >70% of eSTRs are significantly linked to local DNA methylation. Importantly, the effects of meSTRs on DNA methylation remain consistent across cancer types. Overall, our findings enhance the understanding of how functional STR variations influence gene expression and DNA methylation. Our study highlights shared regulatory mechanisms of STRs across multiple cancers, offering a foundation for future research into their broader implications in tumor biology.

28768687	2017	Genome research	HIT'nDRIVE: patient-specific multidriver gene prioritization for precision oncology.	"Prioritizing molecular alterations that act as drivers of cancer remains a crucial bottleneck in therapeutic development. Here we introduce HIT'nDRIVE, a computational method that integrates genomic and transcriptomic data to identify a set of patient-specific, sequence-altered genes, with sufficient collective influence over dysregulated transcripts. HIT'nDRIVE aims to solve the ""random walk facility location"" (RWFL) problem in a gene (or protein) interaction network, which differs from the standard facility location problem by its use of an alternative distance measure: ""multihitting time,"" the expected length of the shortest random walk from any one of the set of sequence-altered genes to an expression-altered target gene. When applied to 2200 tumors from four major cancer types, HIT'nDRIVE revealed many potentially clinically actionable driver genes. We also demonstrated that it is possible to perform accurate phenotype prediction for tumor samples by only using HIT'nDRIVE-seeded driver gene modules from gene interaction networks. In addition, we identified a number of breast cancer subtype-specific driver modules that are associated with patients' survival outcome. Furthermore, HIT'nDRIVE, when applied to a large panel of pan-cancer cell lines, accurately predicted drug efficacy using the driver genes and their seeded gene modules. Overall, HIT'nDRIVE may help clinicians contextualize massive multiomics data in therapeutic decision making, enabling widespread implementation of precision oncology."
40229908	2025	Genome biology	Extracellular vesicle-derived miRNA-mediated cell-cell communication inference for single-cell transcriptomic data with miRTalk.	MicroRNAs are released from cells in extracellular vesicles (EVs), representing an essential mode of cell-cell communication (CCC) via a regulatory effect on gene expression. Single-cell RNA-sequencing technologies have ushered in an era of elucidating CCC at single-cell resolution. Herein, we present miRTalk, a pioneering approach for inferring CCC mediated by EV-derived miRNA-target interactions (MiTIs). The benchmarking against simulated and real-world datasets demonstrates the superior performance of miRTalk, and the application to four disease scenarios reveals the in-depth MiTI-mediated CCC mechanisms. Collectively, miRTalk can infer EV-derived MiTI-mediated CCC with scRNA-seq data, providing new insights into the intercellular dynamics of biological processes.
41183107	2025	PLoS computational biology	Branch-specific gene discovery in cell differentiation using multi-omics graph attention.	Understanding gene regulation during cell differentiation requires effective integration of multi-omics single-cell data. In this study, we propose BranchKGN, a heterogeneous graph transformer-based framework for identifying branch-specific key genes along cell differentiation trajectories. By integrating scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data into a unified gene representation, we infer differentiation trajectories using Slingshot and construct a heterogeneous graph capturing gene-cell relationships. Through attention-based graph learning, BranchKGN assigns gene importance scores within each cell, enabling the identification of genes consistently informative across branch point cells and their descendant lineages. These genes are then used to reconstruct gene regulatory networks and differentiation trajectories. Validation on three independent datasets demonstrates that the identified gene sets not only capture key regulators of cell fate bifurcation but also support accurate reconstruction of differentiation trajectories. Our results highlight the effectiveness of BranchKGN in dissecting gene regulation dynamics during cellular transitions and provide a valuable tool for multi-omics single-cell analysis.
35228707	2022	Nature biotechnology	Multiscale PHATE identifies multimodal signatures of COVID-19.	As the biomedical community produces datasets that are increasingly complex and high dimensional, there is a need for more sophisticated computational tools to extract biological insights. We present Multiscale PHATE, a method that sweeps through all levels of data granularity to learn abstracted biological features directly predictive of disease outcome. Built on a coarse-graining process called diffusion condensation, Multiscale PHATE learns a data topology that can be analyzed at coarse resolutions for high-level summarizations of data and at fine resolutions for detailed representations of subsets. We apply Multiscale PHATE to a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) dataset with 54 million cells from 168 hospitalized patients and find that patients who die show CD16(hi)CD66b(lo) neutrophil and IFN-gamma(+) granzyme B(+) Th17 cell responses. We also show that population groupings from Multiscale PHATE directly fed into a classifier predict disease outcome more accurately than naive featurizations of the data. Multiscale PHATE is broadly generalizable to different data types, including flow cytometry, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), single-cell sequencing assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (scATAC-seq), and clinical variables.
38844966	2024	Genome biology	iIMPACT: integrating image and molecular profiles for spatial transcriptomics analysis.	Current clustering analysis of spatial transcriptomics data primarily relies on molecular information and fails to fully exploit the morphological features present in histology images, leading to compromised accuracy and interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a multi-stage statistical method called iIMPACT. It identifies and defines histology-based spatial domains based on AI-reconstructed histology images and spatial context of gene expression measurements, and detects domain-specific differentially expressed genes. Through multiple case studies, we demonstrate iIMPACT outperforms existing methods in accuracy and interpretability and provides insights into the cellular spatial organization and landscape of functional genes within spatial transcriptomics data.
33079984	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	Multimodal analysis of gene expression from postmortem brains and blood identifies synaptic vesicle trafficking genes to be associated with Parkinson's disease.	OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify key susceptibility gene targets in multiple datasets generated from postmortem brains and blood of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and healthy controls (HC). METHODS: We performed a multitiered analysis to integrate the gene expression data using multiple-gene chips from 244 human postmortem tissues. We identified hub node genes in the highly PD-related consensus module by constructing protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. Next, we validated the top four interacting genes in 238 subjects (90 sporadic PD, 125 HC and 23 Parkinson's Plus Syndrome (PPS)). Utilizing multinomial logistic regression analysis (MLRA) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC), we analyzed the risk factors and diagnostic power for discriminating PD from HC and PPS. RESULTS: We identified 1333 genes that were significantly different between PD and HCs based on seven microarray datasets. The identified MEturquoise module is related to synaptic vesicle trafficking (SVT) dysfunction in PD (P < 0.05), and PPI analysis revealed that SVT genes PPP2CA, SYNJ1, NSF and PPP3CB were the top four hub node genes in MEturquoise (P < 0.001). The levels of these four genes in PD postmortem brains were lower than those in HC brains. We found lower blood levels of PPP2CA, SYNJ1 and NSF in PD compared with HC, and lower SYNJ1 in PD compared with PPS (P < 0.05). SYNJ1, negatively correlated to PD severity, displayed an excellent power to discriminating PD from HC and PPS. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights that SVT genes, especially SYNJ1, may be promising markers in discriminating PD from HCs and PPS.
40662790	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Refinement strategies for Tangram for reliable single-cell to spatial mapping.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides comprehensive gene expression data at a single-cell level but lacks spatial context. In contrast, spatial transcriptomics captures both spatial and transcriptional information but is limited by resolution, sensitivity, or feasibility. No single technology combines both the high spatial resolution and deep transcriptomic profiling at the single-cell level without tradeoffs. Spatial mapping tools that integrate scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data are crucial to bridge this gap. However, we found that Tangram, one of the most prominent spatial mapping tools, provides inconsistent results over repeated runs. RESULTS: We refine Tangram to achieve more consistent cell mappings and investigate the challenges that arise from data characteristics. We find that the mapping quality depends on the gene expression sparsity. To address this, we (1) train the model on an informative gene subset, (2) apply cell filtering, (3) introduce several forms of regularization, and (4) incorporate neighborhood information. Evaluations on real and simulated mouse datasets demonstrate that this approach improves both gene expression prediction and cell mapping. Consistent cell mapping strengthens the reliability of the projection of cell annotations and features into space, gene imputation, and correction of low-quality measurements. Our pipeline, which includes gene set and hyperparameter selection, can serve as guidance for applying Tangram on other datasets, while our benchmarking framework with data simulation and inconsistency metrics is useful for evaluating other tools or Tangram modifications. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The refinements for Tangram and our benchmarking pipeline are available at https://github.com/daisybio/Tangram_Refinement_Strategies.
37279733	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	JUMP: replicability analysis of high-throughput experiments with applications to spatial transcriptomic studies.	MOTIVATION: Replicability is the cornerstone of scientific research. The current statistical method for high-dimensional replicability analysis either cannot control the false discovery rate (FDR) or is too conservative. RESULTS: We propose a statistical method, JUMP, for the high-dimensional replicability analysis of two studies. The input is a high-dimensional paired sequence of p-values from two studies and the test statistic is the maximum of p-values of the pair. JUMP uses four states of the p-value pairs to indicate whether they are null or non-null. Conditional on the hidden states, JUMP computes the cumulative distribution function of the maximum of p-values for each state to conservatively approximate the probability of rejection under the composite null of replicability. JUMP estimates unknown parameters and uses a step-up procedure to control FDR. By incorporating different states of composite null, JUMP achieves a substantial power gain over existing methods while controlling the FDR. Analyzing two pairs of spatially resolved transcriptomic datasets, JUMP makes biological discoveries that otherwise cannot be obtained by using existing methods. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: An R package JUMP implementing the JUMP method is available on CRAN (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=JUMP).
37897361	2024	Nucleic acids research	AnimalMetaOmics: a multi-omics data resources for exploring animal microbial genomes and microbiomes.	The Animal Meta-omics landscape database (AnimalMetaOmics, https://yanglab.hzau.edu.cn/animalmetaomics#/) is a comprehensive and freely available resource that includes metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and metaproteomic data from various non-human animal species and provides abundant information on animal microbiomes, including cluster analysis of microbial cognate genes, functional gene annotations, active microbiota composition, gene expression abundance, and microbial protein identification. In this work, 55 898 microbial genomes were annotated from 581 animal species, including 42 924 bacterial genomes, 12 336 virus genomes, 496 archaea genomes and 142 fungi genomes. Moreover, 321 metatranscriptomic datasets were analyzed from 31 animal species and 326 metaproteomic datasets from four animal species, as well as the pan-genomic dynamics and compositional characteristics of 679 bacterial species and 13 archaea species from animal hosts. Researchers can efficiently access and acquire the information of cross-host microbiota through a user-friendly interface, such as species, genomes, activity levels, expressed protein sequences and functions, and pan-genome composition. These valuable resources provide an important reference for better exploring the classification, functional diversity, biological process diversity and functional genes of animal microbiota.
33963834	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	ProTICS reveals prognostic impact of tumor infiltrating immune cells in different molecular subtypes.	Different subtypes of the same cancer often show distinct genomic signatures and require targeted treatments. The differences at the cellular and molecular levels of tumor microenvironment in different cancer subtypes have significant effects on tumor pathogenesis and prognostic outcomes. Although there have been significant researches on the prognostic association of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in selected histological subtypes, few investigations have systemically reported the prognostic impacts of immune cells in molecular subtypes, as quantified by machine learning approaches on multi-omics datasets. This paper describes a new computational framework, ProTICS, to quantify the differences in the proportion of immune cells in tumor microenvironment and estimate their prognostic effects in different subtypes. First, we stratified patients into molecular subtypes based on gene expression and methylation profiles by applying nonnegative tensor factorization technique. Then we quantified the proportion of cell types in each specimen using an mRNA-based deconvolution method. For tumors in each subtype, we estimated the prognostic effects of immune cell types by applying Cox proportional hazard regression. At the molecular level, we also predicted the prognosis of signature genes for each subtype. Finally, we benchmarked the performance of ProTICS on three TCGA datasets and another independent METABRIC dataset. ProTICS successfully stratified tumors into different molecular subtypes manifested by distinct overall survival. Furthermore, the different immune cell types showed distinct prognostic patterns with respect to molecular subtypes. This study provides new insights into the prognostic association between immune cells and molecular subtypes, showing the utility of immune cells as potential prognostic markers. Availability: R code is available at https://github.com/liu-shuhui/ProTICS.

36513375	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Incomplete time-series gene expression in integrative study for islet autoimmunity prediction.	Type 1 diabetes (T1D) outcome prediction plays a vital role in identifying novel risk factors, ensuring early patient care and designing cohort studies. TEDDY is a longitudinal cohort study that collects a vast amount of multi-omics and clinical data from its participants to explore the progression and markers of T1D. However, missing data in the omics profiles make the outcome prediction a difficult task. TEDDY collected time series gene expression for less than 6% of enrolled participants. Additionally, for the participants whose gene expressions are collected, 79% time steps are missing. This study introduces an advanced bioinformatics framework for gene expression imputation and islet autoimmunity (IA) prediction. The imputation model generates synthetic data for participants with partially or entirely missing gene expression. The prediction model integrates the synthetic gene expression with other risk factors to achieve better predictive performance. Comprehensive experiments on TEDDY datasets show that: (1) Our pipeline can effectively integrate synthetic gene expression with family history, HLA genotype and SNPs to better predict IA status at 2 years (sensitivity 0.622, AUC 0.715) compared with the individual datasets and state-of-the-art results in the literature (AUC 0.682). (2) The synthetic gene expression contains predictive signals as strong as the true gene expression, reducing reliance on expensive and long-term longitudinal data collection. (3) Time series gene expression is crucial to the proposed improvement and shows significantly better predictive ability than cross-sectional gene expression. (4) Our pipeline is robust to limited data availability. Availability: Code is available at https://github.com/compbiolabucf/TEDDY.
40705925	2025	Nucleic acids research	A cluster-based cell-type deconvolution of spatial transcriptomic data.	Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has emerged as an efficient technology for mapping gene expression within tissue sections, offering informative spatial context for gene activities. However, most current ST techniques suffer from low spatial resolution, where each spatial location often contains cells of various types. Deconvolution methods are used to resolve the cell mixture within the spots, but conventional approaches rely on spot-by-spot analyses, which are limited by low gene expression levels and disregard spatial relationships between spots, ultimately reducing performance. Here, we introduce DECLUST, a cluster-based deconvolution method to accurately estimate the cell-type composition in ST data. The method identifies spatial clusters of spots using both gene expression and spatial coordinates, hence preserving the spatial structure of the tissue. Deconvolution is subsequently performed on the aggregated gene expression of individual clusters, mitigating the challenges associated with low expression levels in individual spots. We evaluate DECLUST on simulated ST datasets from a human breast cancer tissue and two real ST datasets from human ovarian cancer and mouse brain. We compare DECLUST to current methods including CARD, GraphST, Cell2location, and Tangram. The results indicate that DECLUST not only maintains the spatial integrity of tissues but also outperforms existing methods in terms of robustness and accuracy. In conclusion, DECLUST provides an effective and reliable approach for identifying cell-type compositions in ST data.
38547401	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Clustering single-cell multi-omics data via graph regularized multi-view ensemble learning.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell clustering plays a crucial role in distinguishing between cell types, facilitating the analysis of cell heterogeneity mechanisms. While many existing clustering methods rely solely on gene expression data obtained from single-cell RNA sequencing techniques to identify cell clusters, the information contained in mono-omic data is often limited, leading to suboptimal clustering performance. The emergence of single-cell multi-omics sequencing technologies enables the integration of multiple omics data for identifying cell clusters, but how to integrate different omics data effectively remains challenging. In addition, designing a clustering method that performs well across various types of multi-omics data poses a persistent challenge due to the data's inherent characteristics. RESULTS: In this paper, we propose a graph-regularized multi-view ensemble clustering (GRMEC-SC) model for single-cell clustering. Our proposed approach can adaptively integrate multiple omics data and leverage insights from multiple base clustering results. We extensively evaluate our method on five multi-omics datasets through a series of rigorous experiments. The results of these experiments demonstrate that our GRMEC-SC model achieves competitive performance across diverse multi-omics datasets with varying characteristics. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Implementation of GRMEC-SC, along with examples, can be found on the GitHub repository: https://github.com/polarisChen/GRMEC-SC.
39090647	2024	Genome biology	aKNNO: single-cell and spatial transcriptomics clustering with an optimized adaptive k-nearest neighbor graph.	Typical clustering methods for single-cell and spatial transcriptomics struggle to identify rare cell types, while approaches tailored to detect rare cell types gain this ability at the cost of poorer performance for grouping abundant ones. Here, we develop aKNNO to simultaneously identify abundant and rare cell types based on an adaptive k-nearest neighbor graph with optimization. Benchmarking on 38 simulated and 20 single-cell and spatial transcriptomics datasets demonstrates that aKNNO identifies both abundant and rare cell types more accurately than general and specialized methods. Using only gene expression aKNNO maps abundant and rare cells more precisely compared to integrative approaches.
36593397	2023	Nature biotechnology	Integration of whole transcriptome spatial profiling with protein markers.	Spatial transcriptomics and proteomics provide complementary information that independently transformed our understanding of complex biological processes. However, experimental integration of these modalities is limited. To overcome this, we developed Spatial PrOtein and Transcriptome Sequencing (SPOTS) for high-throughput simultaneous spatial transcriptomics and protein profiling. Compared with unimodal measurements, SPOTS substantially improves signal resolution and cell clustering and enhances the discovery power in differential gene expression analysis across tissue regions.
37080761	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Graph deep learning enabled spatial domains identification for spatial transcriptomics.	Advancing spatially resolved transcriptomics (ST) technologies help biologists comprehensively understand organ function and tissue microenvironment. Accurate spatial domain identification is the foundation for delineating genome heterogeneity and cellular interaction. Motivated by this perspective, a graph deep learning (GDL) based spatial clustering approach is constructed in this paper. First, the deep graph infomax module embedded with residual gated graph convolutional neural network is leveraged to address the gene expression profiles and spatial positions in ST. Then, the Bayesian Gaussian mixture model is applied to handle the latent embeddings to generate spatial domains. Designed experiments certify that the presented method is superior to other state-of-the-art GDL-enabled techniques on multiple ST datasets. The codes and dataset used in this manuscript are summarized at https://github.com/narutoten520/SCGDL.
35947748	2023	Nucleic acids research	SUMMER: a Mendelian randomization interactive server to systematically evaluate the causal effects of risk factors and circulating biomarkers on pan-cancer survival.	Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) underlying case-control design have uncovered hundreds of genetic loci involved in tumorigenesis and provided rich resources for identifying risk factors and biomarkers associated with cancer susceptibility. However, the application of GWAS in determining the genetic architecture of cancer survival remains unestablished. Here, we systematically evaluated genetic effects at the genome-wide level on cancer survival that included overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS), leveraging data deposited in the UK Biobank cohort of a total of 19 628 incident patients across 17 cancer types. Furthermore, we assessed the causal effects of risk factors and circulating biomarkers on cancer prognosis via a Mendelian randomization (MR) analytic framework, which integrated cancer survival GWAS dataset, along with phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) and blood genome-wide gene expression/DNA methylation quantitative trait loci (eQTL/meQTL) datasets. On average, more than 10 traits, 700 genes, and 4,500 CpG sites were prone to cancer prognosis. Finally, we developed a user-friendly online database, SUrvival related cancer Multi-omics database via MEndelian Randomization (SUMMER; http://njmu-edu.cn:3838/SUMMER/), to help users query, browse, and download cancer survival results. In conclusion, SUMMER provides an important resource to assist the research community in understanding the genetic mechanisms of cancer survival.
35792822	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Identification of cell-type-specific spatially variable genes accounting for excess zeros.	MOTIVATION: Spatial transcriptomic techniques can profile gene expressions while retaining the spatial information, thus offering unprecedented opportunities to explore the relationship between gene expression and spatial locations. The spatial relationship may vary across cell types, but there is a lack of statistical methods to identify cell-type-specific spatially variable (SV) genes by simultaneously modeling excess zeros and cell-type proportions. RESULTS: We develop a statistical approach CTSV to detect cell-type-specific SV genes. CTSV directly models spatial raw count data and considers zero-inflation as well as overdispersion using a zero-inflated negative binomial distribution. It then incorporates cell-type proportions and spatial effect functions in the zero-inflated negative binomial regression framework. The R package pscl is employed to fit the model. For robustness, a Cauchy combination rule is applied to integrate P-values from multiple choices of spatial effect functions. Simulation studies show that CTSV not only outperforms competing methods at the aggregated level but also achieves more power at the cell-type level. By analyzing pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma spatial transcriptomic data, SV genes identified by CTSV reveal biological insights at the cell-type level. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The R package of CTSV is available at https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/CTSV.html. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
40983914	2025	Genome biology	SIGEL: a context-aware genomic representation learning framework for spatial genomics analysis.	Spatial transcriptomics (ST) integrates spatial information into genomics, yet methods for generating spatially-informed gene representations are limited and computationally intensive. We present SIGEL, a cost-effective framework that derives gene manifolds from ST data by exploiting spatial genomic context. The resulting SIGEL-generated gene representations (SGRs) are context-aware, biologically meaningful, and robust across samples, making them highly effective for key downstream tasks, including imputing missing genes, detecting spatial expression patterns, identifying disease-related genes and interactions, and improving spatial clustering. Extensive experiments across diverse ST datasets validate SIGEL's effectiveness and highlight its potential in advancing spatial genomics research.
38978088	2024	Genome biology	Panpipes: a pipeline for multiomic single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data analysis.	Single-cell multiomic analysis of the epigenome, transcriptome, and proteome allows for comprehensive characterization of the molecular circuitry that underpins cell identity and state. However, the holistic interpretation of such datasets presents a challenge given a paucity of approaches for systematic, joint evaluation of different modalities. Here, we present Panpipes, a set of computational workflows designed to automate multimodal single-cell and spatial transcriptomic analyses by incorporating widely-used Python-based tools to perform quality control, preprocessing, integration, clustering, and reference mapping at scale. Panpipes allows reliable and customizable analysis and evaluation of individual and integrated modalities, thereby empowering decision-making before downstream investigations.
41081728	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	OmniDoublet: a method for doublet detection in multimodal single-cell sequencing data.	Doublets in single-cell sequencing data, caused by the simultaneous capture of two or more cells within a single reaction volume, introduce biases that compromise downstream analysis. Existing doublet detection methods primarily focus on single-modality data and exhibit limited robustness across datasets. To overcome these limitations, we developed OmniDoublet, a multimodal doublet detection method that integrates transcriptomic and epigenomic data. OmniDoublet leverages the Jaccard similarity coefficient to calculate weights that assess the reliability of neighboring cells across modalities, combining doublet scores from different modalities into a final integrated score. It further employs a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to establish thresholds, enabling accurate binary classification of cells as singlets or doublets based on the integrated score. OmniDoublet offers a robust framework for detecting doublets across diverse scenarios. Benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods across various datasets demonstrates that OmniDoublet achieves superior accuracy, robustness, and scalability. By harnessing the comprehensive information from multimodal single-cell data, OmniDoublet enhances doublet detection, enabling researchers to gain more accurate and reliable insights into cellular processes.
40729405	2025	PLoS computational biology	PoweREST: Statistical power estimation for spatial transcriptomics experiments to detect differentially expressed genes between two conditions.	Recent advancements in spatial transcriptomics (ST) have significantly enhanced biological research in various domains. However, the high cost for current ST data generation techniques restricts the large-scale application of ST. Consequently, maximization of the use of available resources to achieve robust statistical power for ST data is a pressing need. One fundamental question in ST analysis is detection of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) under different conditions using ST data. Such DEG analyses are performed frequently, but their power calculations are rarely discussed in the literature. To address this gap, we developed PoweREST, a power estimation tool designed to support the power calculation for DEG detection with 10X Genomics Visium data. PoweREST enables power estimation both before any ST experiments and after preliminary data are collected, making it suitable for a wide variety of power analyses in ST studies. We also provide a user-friendly, program-free web application that allows users to interactively calculate and visualize study power along with relevant parameters.
31808789	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	SpaCell: integrating tissue morphology and spatial gene expression to predict disease cells.	MOTIVATION: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technology is increasingly being applied because it enables the measurement of spatial gene expression in an intact tissue along with imaging morphology of the same tissue. However, current analysis methods for ST data do not use image pixel information, thus missing the quantitative links between gene expression and tissue morphology. RESULTS: We developed a user-friendly deep learning software, SpaCell, to integrate millions of pixel intensity values with thousands of gene expression measurements from spatially barcoded spots in a tissue. We show the integration approach outperforms the use of gene-count data alone or imaging data alone to build deep learning models to identify cell types or predict labels of tissue images with high resolution and accuracy. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The SpaCell package is open source under an MIT licence and it is available at https://github.com/BiomedicalMachineLearning/SpaCell. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
35422018	2022	Genome biology	Explainable multiview framework for dissecting spatial relationships from highly multiplexed data.	The advancement of highly multiplexed spatial technologies requires scalable methods that can leverage spatial information. We present MISTy, a flexible, scalable, and explainable machine learning framework for extracting relationships from any spatial omics data, from dozens to thousands of measured markers. MISTy builds multiple views focusing on different spatial or functional contexts to dissect different effects. We evaluated MISTy on in silico and breast cancer datasets measured by imaging mass cytometry and spatial transcriptomics. We estimated structural and functional interactions coming from different spatial contexts in breast cancer and demonstrated how to relate MISTy's results to clinical features.
25527095	2015	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Empowering biologists with multi-omics data: colorectal cancer as a paradigm.	MOTIVATION: Recent completion of the global proteomic characterization of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) colorectal cancer (CRC) cohort resulted in the first tumor dataset with complete molecular measurements at DNA, RNA and protein levels. Using CRC as a paradigm, we describe the application of the NetGestalt framework to provide easy access and interpretation of multi-omics data. RESULTS: The NetGestalt CRC portal includes genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and clinical data for the TCGA CRC cohort, data from other CRC tumor cohorts and cell lines, and existing knowledge on pathways and networks, giving a total of more than 17 million data points. The portal provides features for data query, upload, visualization and integration. These features can be flexibly combined to serve various needs of the users, maximizing the synergy among omics data, human visualization and quantitative analysis. Using three case studies, we demonstrate that the portal not only provides user-friendly data query and visualization but also enables efficient data integration within a single omics data type, across multiple omics data types, and over biological networks. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The NetGestalt CRC portal can be freely accessed at http://www.netgestalt.org.

39377397	2024	Nucleic acids research	Integrated multi-omics analysis of PBX1 in mouse adult neural stem- and progenitor cells identifies a transcriptional module that functionally links PBX1 to TCF3/4.	Developmental transcription factors act in networks, but how these networks achieve cell- and tissue specificity is still poorly understood. Here, we explored pre-B cell leukemia homeobox 1 (PBX1) in adult neurogenesis combining genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic approaches. ChIP-seq analysis uncovered PBX1 binding to numerous genomic sites. Integration of PBX1 ChIP-seq with ATAC-seq data predicted interaction partners, which were subsequently validated by mass spectrometry. Whole transcriptome spatial RNA analysis revealed shared expression dynamics of Pbx1 and interacting factors. Among these were class I bHLH proteins TCF3 and TCF4. RNA-seq following Pbx1, Tcf3 or Tcf4 knockdown identified proliferation- and differentiation associated genes as shared targets, while sphere formation assays following knockdown argued for functional cooperativity of PBX1 and TCF3 in progenitor cell proliferation. Notably, while physiological PBX1-TCF interaction has not yet been described, chromosomal translocation resulting in genomic TCF3::PBX1 fusion characterizes a subtype of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Introducing Pbx1 into Nalm6 cells, a pre-B cell line expressing TCF3 but lacking PBX1, upregulated the leukemogenic genes BLK and NOTCH3, arguing that functional PBX1-TCF cooperativity likely extends to hematopoiesis. Our study hence uncovers a transcriptional module orchestrating the balance between progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation in adult neurogenesis with potential implications for leukemia etiology.
38416785	2024	PLoS computational biology	STGIC: A graph and image convolution-based method for spatial transcriptomic clustering.	Spatial transcriptomic (ST) clustering employs spatial and transcription information to group spots spatially coherent and transcriptionally similar together into the same spatial domain. Graph convolution network (GCN) and graph attention network (GAT), fed with spatial coordinates derived adjacency and transcription profile derived feature matrix are often used to solve the problem. Our proposed method STGIC (spatial transcriptomic clustering with graph and image convolution) is designed for techniques with regular lattices on chips. It utilizes an adaptive graph convolution (AGC) to get high quality pseudo-labels and then resorts to dilated convolution framework (DCF) for virtual image converted from gene expression information and spatial coordinates of spots. The dilation rates and kernel sizes are set appropriately and updating of weight values in the kernels is made to be subject to the spatial distance from the position of corresponding elements to kernel centers so that feature extraction of each spot is better guided by spatial distance to neighbor spots. Self-supervision realized by Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, spatial continuity loss and cross entropy calculated among spots with high confidence pseudo-labels make up the training objective of DCF. STGIC attains state-of-the-art (SOTA) clustering performance on the benchmark dataset of 10x Visium human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Besides, it's capable of depicting fine structures of other tissues from other species as well as guiding the identification of marker genes. Also, STGIC is expandable to Stereo-seq data with high spatial resolution.
39420633	2025	Nucleic acids research	MAPbrain: a multi-omics atlas of the primate brain.	The brain is the central hub of the entire nervous system. Its development is a lifelong process guided by a genetic blueprint. Understanding how genes influence brain development is critical for deciphering the formation of human cognitive functions and the underlying mechanisms of neurological disorders. Recent advances in multi-omics techniques have now made it possible to explore these aspects comprehensively. However, integrating and analyzing extensive multi-omics data presents significant challenges. Here, we introduced MAPbrain (http://bigdata.ibp.ac.cn/mapBRAIN/), a multi-omics atlas of the primate brain. This repository integrates and normalizes both our own lab's published data and publicly available multi-omics data, encompassing 21 million brain cells from 38 key brain regions and 436 sub-regions across embryonic and adult stages, with 164 time points in humans and non-human primates. MAPbrain offers a unique, robust, and interactive platform that includes transcriptomics, epigenomics, and spatial transcriptomics data, facilitating a comprehensive exploration of brain development. The platform enables the exploration of cell type- and time point-specific markers, gene expression comparison between brain regions and species, joint analyses across transcriptome and epigenome, and navigation of cell types across species, brain regions, and development stages. Additionally, MAPbrain provides an online integration module for users to navigate and analyze their own data within the platform.
37953397	2024	Nucleic acids research	standR: spatial transcriptomic analysis for GeoMx DSP data.	To gain a better understanding of the complexity of gene expression in normal and diseased tissues it is important to account for the spatial context and identity of cells in situ. State-of-the-art spatial profiling technologies, such as the Nanostring GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler (DSP), now allow quantitative spatially resolved measurement of the transcriptome in tissues. However, the bioinformatics pipelines currently used to analyse GeoMx data often fail to successfully account for the technical variability within the data and the complexity of experimental designs, thus limiting the accuracy and reliability of the subsequent analysis. Carefully designed quality control workflows, that include in-depth experiment-specific investigations into technical variation and appropriate adjustment for such variation can address this issue. Here, we present standR, an R/Bioconductor package that enables an end-to-end analysis of GeoMx DSP data. With four case studies from previously published experiments, we demonstrate how the standR workflow can enhance the statistical power of GeoMx DSP data analysis and how the application of standR enables scientists to develop in-depth insights into the biology of interest.

40355284	2025	Genome research	STCC enhances spatial domain detection through consensus clustering of spatial transcriptomics data.	The rapid advance of spatially resolved transcriptomics technologies has yielded substantial spatial transcriptomics data. Deriving biological insights from these data poses nontrivial computational and analysis challenges, of which the most fundamental step is spatial domain detection (or spatial clustering). Although a number of tools for spatial domain detection have been proposed in recent years, their performance varies across data sets and experimental platforms. It is thus an important task to take full advantage of different tools to get a more accurate and stable result through consensus strategy. In this work, we developed STCC, a novel consensus clustering framework for spatial transcriptomics data that aggregates outcomes from state-of-the-art tools using a variety of consensus strategies, including Onehot-based, average-based, hypergraph-based, and wNMF-based methods. Comprehensive assessments on simulated and real data from distinct experimental platforms show that consensus clustering significantly improves clustering accuracy over individual methods under varied input parameters. For normal tissue samples exhibiting clear layered structure, consensus clustering by integrating multiple baseline methods leads to improved results. Conversely, when analyzing tumor samples that display scattered cell type distribution patterns, integration of a single baseline method yields satisfactory performance. For consensus strategies, average-based and hypergraph-based approaches demonstrate optimal precision and stability. Overall, STCC provides a scalable and practical solution for spatial domain detection in spatial transcriptomics data, laying a solid foundation for future research and applications in spatial transcriptomics.
38438615	2024	Nature methods	Spatial landmark detection and tissue registration with deep learning.	Spatial landmarks are crucial in describing histological features between samples or sites, tracking regions of interest in microscopy, and registering tissue samples within a common coordinate framework. Although other studies have explored unsupervised landmark detection, existing methods are not well-suited for histological image data as they often require a large number of images to converge, are unable to handle nonlinear deformations between tissue sections and are ineffective for z-stack alignment, other modalities beyond image data or multimodal data. We address these challenges by introducing effortless landmark detection, a new unsupervised landmark detection and registration method using neural-network-guided thin-plate splines. Our proposed method is evaluated on a diverse range of datasets including histology and spatially resolved transcriptomics, demonstrating superior performance in both accuracy and stability compared to existing approaches.

41326819	2025	Nature methods	Multimodal foundation transformer models for multiscale genomics.	Transformer-based models are rapidly becoming foundational tools for analyzing and integrating multiscale biological data. This Perspective examines recent advances in transformer architectures, tracing their evolution from unimodal and augmented unimodal models to large-scale multimodal foundation models operating across genomic sequences, single-cell transcriptomics and spatial data. We categorize these models into three tiers and evaluate their capabilities for structural learning, representation transfer and tasks such as cell annotation, prediction and imputation. While discussing tokenization, interpretability and scalability challenges, we highlight emerging approaches that leverage masked modeling, contrastive learning and large language models. To support broader adoption, we provide practical guidance through code-based primers, using public datasets and open-source implementations. Finally, we propose designing a modular 'Super Transformer' architecture using cross-attention mechanisms to integrate heterogeneous modalities. This Perspective serves as a resource and roadmap for leveraging transformer models in multiscale, multimodal genomics.
34864909	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Detecting spatially co-expressed gene clusters with functional coherence by graph-regularized convolutional neural network.	MOTIVATION: Clustering spatial-resolved gene expression is an essential analysis to reveal gene activities in the underlying morphological context by their functional roles. However, conventional clustering analysis does not consider gene expression co-localizations in tissue for detecting spatial expression patterns or functional relationships among the genes for biological interpretation in the spatial context. In this article, we present a convolutional neural network (CNN) regularized by the graph of protein-protein interaction (PPI) network to cluster spatially resolved gene expression. This method improves the coherence of spatial patterns and provides biological interpretation of the gene clusters in the spatial context by exploiting the spatial localization by convolution and gene functional relationships by graph-Laplacian regularization. RESULTS: In this study, we tested clustering the spatially variable genes or all expressed genes in the transcriptome in 22 Visium spatial transcriptomics datasets of different tissue sections publicly available from 10x Genomics and spatialLIBD. The results demonstrate that the PPI-regularized CNN constantly detects gene clusters with coherent spatial patterns and significantly enriched by gene functions with the state-of-the-art performance. Additional case studies on mouse kidney tissue and human breast cancer tissue suggest that the PPI-regularized CNN also detects spatially co-expressed genes to define the corresponding morphological context in the tissue with valuable insights. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Source code is available at https://github.com/kuanglab/CNN-PReg. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
38514799	2025	Nature biotechnology	Starfysh integrates spatial transcriptomic and histologic data to reveal heterogeneous tumor-immune hubs.	Spatially resolved gene expression profiling provides insight into tissue organization and cell-cell crosstalk; however, sequencing-based spatial transcriptomics (ST) lacks single-cell resolution. Current ST analysis methods require single-cell RNA sequencing data as a reference for rigorous interpretation of cell states, mostly do not use associated histology images and are not capable of inferring shared neighborhoods across multiple tissues. Here we present Starfysh, a computational toolbox using a deep generative model that incorporates archetypal analysis and any known cell type markers to characterize known or new tissue-specific cell states without a single-cell reference. Starfysh improves the characterization of spatial dynamics in complex tissues using histology images and enables the comparison of niches as spatial hubs across tissues. Integrative analysis of primary estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and metaplastic breast cancer (MBC) tissues led to the identification of spatial hubs with patient- and disease-specific cell type compositions and revealed metabolic reprogramming shaping immunosuppressive hubs in aggressive MBC.
41224531	2025	Genome research	Label-free selection of marker genes in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics with geneCover.	The selection of marker gene panels is critical for capturing the cellular and spatial heterogeneity in the expanding atlases of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics data. Most current approaches to marker gene selection operate in a label-based framework, which is inherently limited by its dependency on predefined cell type labels or clustering results. In contrast, existing label-free methods often struggle to identify genes that characterize rare cell types or subtle spatial patterns, and they frequently fail to scale efficiently with large data sets. Here, we introduce geneCover, a label-free combinatorial method that selects an optimal panel of minimally redundant marker genes based on gene-gene correlations. Our method demonstrates excellent scalability to large data sets and identifies marker gene panels that capture distinct correlation structures across the transcriptome. This allows geneCover to distinguish cell states in various tissues of living organisms effectively, including those associated with rare or otherwise difficult-to-identify cell types. We evaluate the performance of geneCover across various scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data sets, comparing it to other label-free algorithms to highlight its utility and potential in diverse biological contexts.
39530242	2025	Nucleic acids research	MolluscDB 2.0: a comprehensive functional and evolutionary genomics database for over 1400 molluscan species.	Mollusca represents the second-largest animal phylum but remains less explored genomically. The increase in high-quality genomes and diverse functional genomic data holds great promise for advancing our understanding of molluscan biology and evolution. To address the opportunities and challenges facing the molluscan research community in managing vast multi-omics resources, we developed MolluscDB 2.0 (http://mgbase.qnlm.ac), which integrates extensive functional genomic data and offers user-friendly tools for multilevel integrative and comparative analyses. MolluscDB 2.0 covers 1450 species across all eight molluscan classes and compiles  approximately 4200 datasets, making it the most comprehensive multi-omics resource for molluscs to date.

MolluscDB 2.0 also more than doubles the number of functional modules and analytical tools, updating 14 original modules and introducing 20 new, specialized modules. Overall, MolluscDB 2.0 provides highly valuable, open-access multi-omics platform for the molluscan research community, expediting scientific discoveries and deepening our understanding of molluscan biology and evolution.
31925439	2020	Nucleic acids research	Artificial escape from XCI by DNA methylation editing of the CDKL5 gene.	A significant number of X-linked genes escape from X chromosome inactivation and are associated with a distinct epigenetic signature. One epigenetic modification that strongly correlates with X-escape is reduced DNA methylation in promoter regions. Here, we created an artificial escape by editing DNA methylation on the promoter of CDKL5, a gene causative for an infantile epilepsy, from the silenced X-chromosomal allele in human neuronal-like cells. We identify that a fusion of the catalytic domain of TET1 to dCas9 targeted to the CDKL5 promoter using three guide RNAs causes significant reactivation of the inactive allele in combination with removal of methyl groups from CpG dinucleotides. Strikingly, we demonstrate that co-expression of TET1 and a VP64 transactivator have a synergistic effect on the reactivation of the inactive allele to levels >60% of the active allele. We further used a multi-omics assessment to determine potential off-targets on the transcriptome and methylome. We find that synergistic delivery of dCas9 effectors is highly selective for the target site. Our findings further elucidate a causal role for reduced DNA methylation associated with escape from X chromosome inactivation. Understanding the epigenetics associated with escape from X chromosome inactivation has potential for those suffering from X-linked disorders.
32275708	2020	PLoS computational biology	Hydra: A mixture modeling framework for subtyping pediatric cancer cohorts using multimodal gene expression signatures.	Precision oncology has primarily relied on coding mutations as biomarkers of response to therapies. While transcriptome analysis can provide valuable information, incorporation into workflows has been difficult. For example, the relative rather than absolute gene expression level needs to be considered, requiring differential expression analysis across samples. However, expression programs related to the cell-of-origin and tumor microenvironment effects confound the search for cancer-specific expression changes. To address these challenges, we developed an unsupervised clustering approach for discovering differential pathway expression within cancer cohorts using gene expression measurements. The hydra approach uses a Dirichlet process mixture model to automatically detect multimodally distributed genes and expression signatures without the need for matched normal tissue. We demonstrate that the hydra approach is more sensitive than widely-used gene set enrichment approaches for detecting multimodal expression signatures. Application of the hydra analysis framework to small blue round cell tumors (including rhabdomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, neuroblastoma, Ewing sarcoma, and osteosarcoma) identified expression signatures associated with changes in the tumor microenvironment. The hydra approach also identified an association between ATRX deletions and elevated immune marker expression in high-risk neuroblastoma. Notably, hydra analysis of all small blue round cell tumors revealed similar subtypes, characterized by changes to infiltrating immune and stromal expression signatures.
21177965	2011	Genome research	Multimodal RNA-seq using single-strand, double-strand, and CircLigase-based capture yields a refined and extended description of the C. elegans transcriptome.	We have used a combination of three high-throughput RNA capture and sequencing methods to refine and augment the transcriptome map of a well-studied genetic model, Caenorhabditis elegans. The three methods include a standard (non-directional) library preparation protocol relying on cDNA priming and foldback that has been used in several previous studies for transcriptome characterization in this species, and two directional protocols, one involving direct capture of single-stranded RNA fragments and one involving circular-template PCR (CircLigase). We find that each RNA-seq approach shows specific limitations and biases, with the application of multiple methods providing a more complete map than was obtained from any single method. Of particular note in the analysis were substantial advantages of CircLigase-based and ssRNA-based capture for defining sequences and structures of the precise 5' ends (which were lost using the double-strand cDNA capture method). Of the three methods, ssRNA capture was most effective in defining sequences to the poly(A) junction. Using data sets from a spectrum of C. elegans strains and stages and the UCSC Genome Browser, we provide a series of tools, which facilitate rapid visualization and assignment of gene structures.
36617463	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	The hitchhikers' guide to RNA sequencing and functional analysis.	DNA and RNA sequencing technologies have revolutionized biology and biomedical sciences, sequencing full genomes and transcriptomes at very high speeds and reasonably low costs. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) enables transcript identification and quantification, but once sequencing has concluded researchers can be easily overwhelmed with questions such as how to go from raw data to differential expression (DE), pathway analysis and interpretation. Several pipelines and procedures have been developed to this effect. Even though there is no unique way to perform RNA-Seq analysis, it usually follows these steps: 1) raw reads quality check, 2) alignment of reads to a reference genome, 3) aligned reads' summarization according to an annotation file, 4) DE analysis and 5) gene set analysis and/or functional enrichment analysis. Each step requires researchers to make decisions, and the wide variety of options and resulting large volumes of data often lead to interpretation challenges. There also seems to be insufficient guidance on how best to obtain relevant information and derive actionable knowledge from transcription experiments. In this paper, we explain RNA-Seq steps in detail and outline differences and similarities of different popular options, as well as advantages and disadvantages. We also discuss non-coding RNA analysis, multi-omics, meta-transcriptomics and the use of artificial intelligence methods complementing the arsenal of tools available to researchers. Lastly, we perform a complete analysis from raw reads to DE and functional enrichment analysis, visually illustrating how results are not absolute truths and how algorithmic decisions can greatly impact results and interpretation.
39576225	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	MCGAE: unraveling tumor invasion through integrated multimodal spatial transcriptomics.	Spatially Resolved Transcriptomics (SRT) serves as a cornerstone in biomedical research, revealing the heterogeneity of tissue microenvironments. Integrating multimodal data including gene expression, spatial coordinates, and morphological information poses significant challenges for accurate spatial domain identification. Herein, we present the Multi-view Contrastive Graph Autoencoder (MCGAE), a cutting-edge deep computational framework specifically designed for the intricate analysis of spatial transcriptomics (ST) data. MCGAE advances the field by creating multi-view representations from gene expression and spatial adjacency matrices. Utilizing modular modeling, contrastive graph convolutional networks, and attention mechanisms, it generates modality-specific spatial representations and integrates them into a unified embedding. This integration process is further enriched by the inclusion of morphological image features, markedly enhancing the framework's capability to process multimodal data. Applied to both simulated and real SRT datasets, MCGAE demonstrates superior performance in spatial domain detection, data denoising, trajectory inference, and 3D feature extraction, outperforming existing methods. Specifically, in colorectal cancer liver metastases, MCGAE integrates histological and gene expression data to identify tumor invasion regions and characterize cellular molecular regulation. This breakthrough extends ST analysis and offers new tools for cancer and complex disease research.
40966644	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Graph-based deep learning for integrating single-cell and bulk transcriptomic data to identify clinical cancer subtypes.	The integration of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and bulk transcriptomic data has become essential for deciphering the complex heterogeneity of cancer and identifying clinical cancer subtypes. However, the inherent challenges posed by the high dimensionality, sparsity, and noise characteristics of scRNA-seq data have significantly hindered its widespread clinical translation. To address these limitations, we introduce single-cell and bulk transcriptomic graph deep learning, a graph-based deep learning method that synergistically integrates scRNA-seq and bulk transcriptomic data to precisely identify cancer subtypes and predict clinical outcomes. scBGDL constructs sample-specific gene graphs modeling complex gene-gene interactions and cellular relationships. The architecture employs Graph Attention Networks for feature aggregation, MinCutPool layers for dimensionality reduction, and Transformer modules to capture high-order biological dependencies. Independently validated in each of 16 distinct The Cancer Genome Atlas cancer types, scBGDL significantly outperformed existing methods in prognostic accuracy (mean C-index: 0.7060 versus 0.6709 max competitor), demonstrating robustness and generalizability to diverse transcriptional architectures. To demonstrate clinical versatility, we further evaluated scBGDL in three therapeutic contexts using multicenter cohorts: lung adenocarcinoma survival prediction (n = 1099), epithelial ovarian cancer platinum-based chemotherapy response (n = 762), skin cutaneous melanoma immunotherapy outcome (n = 305). scBGDL consistently delivered robust risk stratification (log-rank P < 0.05 across cohorts), identified key driver edges, and uncovered clinically relevant biological interpretations. By enabling multimodal data integration and interpretable biological insights, scBGDL advances precision oncology for prognosis prediction, therapy optimization, and biomarker discovery. The source code for scBGDL model is available online (https://github.com/NEFLab/scBGDL).
32756918	2020	Nucleic acids research	Comprehensive multi-omics analysis uncovers a group of TGF-beta-regulated genes among lncRNA EPR direct transcriptional targets.	Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can affect multiple layers of gene expression to control crucial cellular functions. We have previously demonstrated that the lncRNA EPR, by controlling gene expression at different levels, affects cell proliferation and migration in cultured mammary gland cells and impairs breast tumor formation in an orthotopic transplant model in mice. Here, we used ChIRP-Seq to identify EPR binding sites on chromatin of NMuMG mammary gland cells overexpressing EPR and identified its trans binding sites in the genome. Then, with the purpose of relating EPR/chromatin interactions to the reshaping of the epitranscriptome landscape, we profiled histone activation marks at promoter/enhancer regions by ChIP-Seq. Finally, we integrated data derived from ChIRP-Seq, ChIP-Seq as well as RNA-Seq in a comprehensive analysis and we selected a group of bona fide direct transcriptional targets of EPR. Among them, we identified a subset of EPR targets whose expression is controlled by TGF-beta with one of them-Arrdc3-being able to modulate Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition. This experimental framework allowed us to correlate lncRNA/chromatin interactions with the real outcome of gene expression and to start defining the gene network regulated by EPR as a component of the TGF-beta pathway.
35870444	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	FitDevo: accurate inference of single-cell developmental potential using sample-specific gene weight.	The quantification of developmental potential is critical for determining developmental stages and identifying essential molecular signatures in single-cell studies. Here, we present FitDevo, a novel method for inferring developmental potential using scRNA-seq data. The main idea of FitDevo is first to generate sample-specific gene weight (SSGW) and then infer developmental potential by calculating the correlation between SSGW and gene expression. SSGW is generated using a generalized linear model that combines sample-specific information and gene weight learned from a training dataset covering scRNA-seq data of 17 previously published datasets. We have rigorously validated FitDevo's effectiveness using a testing dataset with scRNA-seq data from 28 existing datasets and have also demonstrated its superiority over current methods. Furthermore, FitDevo's broad application scope has been illustrated using three practical scenarios: deconvolution analysis of epidermis, spatial transcriptomic data analysis of hearts and intestines, and developmental potential analysis of breast cancer. The source code and related data are available at https://github.com/jumphone/fitdevo.
35758807	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	MOJITOO: a fast and universal method for integration of multimodal single-cell data.	MOTIVATION: The advent of multi-modal single-cell sequencing techniques have shed new light on molecular mechanisms by simultaneously inspecting transcriptomes, epigenomes and proteomes of the same cell. However, to date, the existing computational approaches for integration of multimodal single-cell data are either computationally expensive, require the delineation of parameters or can only be applied to particular modalities. RESULTS: Here we present a single-cell multi-modal integration method, named Multi-mOdal Joint IntegraTion of cOmpOnents (MOJITOO). MOJITOO uses canonical correlation analysis for a fast and parameter free detection of a shared representation of cells from multimodal single-cell data. Moreover, estimated canonical components can be used for interpretation, i.e. association of modality-specific molecular features with the latent space. We evaluate MOJITOO using bi- and tri-modal single-cell datasets and show that MOJITOO outperforms existing methods regarding computational requirements, preservation of original latent spaces and clustering. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The software, code and data for benchmarking are available at https://github.com/CostaLab/MOJITOO and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6348128. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
35349708	2022	Nucleic acids research	Joint dimension reduction and clustering analysis of single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data.	Dimension reduction and (spatial) clustering is usually performed sequentially; however, the low-dimensional embeddings estimated in the dimension-reduction step may not be relevant to the class labels inferred in the clustering step. We therefore developed a computation method, Dimension-Reduction Spatial-Clustering (DR-SC), that can simultaneously perform dimension reduction and (spatial) clustering within a unified framework. Joint analysis by DR-SC produces accurate (spatial) clustering results and ensures the effective extraction of biologically informative low-dimensional features. DR-SC is applicable to spatial clustering in spatial transcriptomics that characterizes the spatial organization of the tissue by segregating it into multiple tissue structures. Here, DR-SC relies on a latent hidden Markov random field model to encourage the spatial smoothness of the detected spatial cluster boundaries. Underlying DR-SC is an efficient expectation-maximization algorithm based on an iterative conditional mode. As such, DR-SC is scalable to large sample sizes and can optimize the spatial smoothness parameter in a data-driven manner. With comprehensive simulations and real data applications, we show that DR-SC outperforms existing clustering and spatial clustering methods: it extracts more biologically relevant features than conventional dimension reduction methods, improves clustering performance, and offers improved trajectory inference and visualization for downstream trajectory inference analyses.
37889053	2024	Nucleic acids research	scGRN: a comprehensive single-cell gene regulatory network platform of human and mouse.	Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are interpretable graph models encompassing the regulatory interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and their downstream target genes. Making sense of the topology and dynamics of GRNs is fundamental to interpreting the mechanisms of disease etiology and translating corresponding findings into novel therapies. Recent advances in single-cell multi-omics techniques have prompted the computational inference of GRNs from single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic data at an unprecedented resolution. Here, we present scGRN (https://bio.liclab.net/scGRN/), a comprehensive single-cell multi-omics gene regulatory network platform of human and mouse. The current version of scGRN catalogs 237 051 cell type-specific GRNs (62 999 692 TF-target gene pairs), covering 160 tissues/cell lines and 1324 single-cell samples. scGRN is the first resource documenting large-scale cell type-specific GRN information of diverse human and mouse conditions inferred from single-cell multi-omics data. We have implemented multiple online tools for effective GRN analysis, including differential TF-target network analysis, TF enrichment analysis, and pathway downstream analysis. We also provided details about TF binding to promoters, super-enhancers and typical enhancers of target genes in GRNs. Taken together, scGRN is an integrative and useful platform for searching, browsing, analyzing, visualizing and downloading GRNs of interest, enabling insight into the differences in regulatory mechanisms across diverse conditions.
33826608	2021	PLoS computational biology	Imputation of spatially-resolved transcriptomes by graph-regularized tensor completion.	High-throughput spatial-transcriptomics RNA sequencing (sptRNA-seq) based on in-situ capturing technologies has recently been developed to spatially resolve transcriptome-wide mRNA expressions mapped to the captured locations in a tissue sample. Due to the low RNA capture efficiency by in-situ capturing and the complication of tissue section preparation, sptRNA-seq data often only provides an incomplete profiling of the gene expressions over the spatial regions of the tissue. In this paper, we introduce a graph-regularized tensor completion model for imputing the missing mRNA expressions in sptRNA-seq data, namely FIST, Fast Imputation of Spatially-resolved transcriptomes by graph-regularized Tensor completion. We first model sptRNA-seq data as a 3-way sparse tensor in genes (p-mode) and the (x, y) spatial coordinates (x-mode and y-mode) of the observed gene expressions, and then consider the imputation of the unobserved entries or fibers as a tensor completion problem in Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD) form. To improve the imputation of highly sparse sptRNA-seq data, we also introduce a protein-protein interaction network to add prior knowledge of gene functions, and a spatial graph to capture the the spatial relations among the capture spots. The tensor completion model is then regularized by a Cartesian product graph of protein-protein interaction network and the spatial graph to capture the high-order relations in the tensor. In the experiments, FIST was tested on ten 10x Genomics Visium spatial transcriptomic datasets of different tissue sections with cross-validation among the known entries in the imputation. FIST significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art methods for single-cell RNAseq data imputation. We also demonstrate that both the spatial graph and PPI network play an important role in improving the imputation. In a case study, we further analyzed the gene clusters obtained from the imputed gene expressions to show that the imputations by FIST indeed capture the spatial characteristics in the gene expressions and reveal functions that are highly relevant to three different kinds of tissues in mouse kidney.
36464486	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Complexity of enhancer networks predicts cell identity and disease genes revealed by single-cell multi-omics analysis.	Many enhancers exist as clusters in the genome and control cell identity and disease genes; however, the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, we introduce an algorithm, eNet, to build enhancer networks by integrating single-cell chromatin accessibility and gene expression profiles. The complexity of enhancer networks is assessed by two metrics: the number of enhancers and the frequency of predicted enhancer interactions (PEIs) based on chromatin co-accessibility. We apply eNet algorithm to a human blood dataset and find cell identity and disease genes tend to be regulated by complex enhancer networks. The network hub enhancers (enhancers with frequent PEIs) are the most functionally important. Compared with super-enhancers, enhancer networks show better performance in predicting cell identity and disease genes. eNet is robust and widely applicable in various human or mouse tissues datasets. Thus, we propose a model of enhancer networks containing three modes: Simple, Multiple and Complex, which are distinguished by their complexity in regulating gene expression. Taken together, our work provides an unsupervised approach to simultaneously identify key cell identity and disease genes and explore the underlying regulatory relationships among enhancers in single cells.
31011186	2019	Nature methods	Multiplexed detection of proteins, transcriptomes, clonotypes and CRISPR perturbations in single cells.	Multimodal single-cell assays provide high-resolution snapshots of complex cell populations, but are mostly limited to transcriptome plus an additional modality. Here, we describe expanded CRISPR-compatible cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (ECCITE-seq) for the high-throughput characterization of at least five modalities of information from each single cell. We demonstrate application of ECCITE-seq to multimodal CRISPR screens with robust direct single-guide RNA capture and to clonotype-aware multimodal phenotyping of cancer samples.
37944045	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Hidden Markov random field models for cell-type assignment of spatially resolved transcriptomics.	MOTIVATION: The recent development of spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) technologies has facilitated research on gene expression in the spatial context. Annotating cell types is one crucial step for downstream analysis. However, many existing algorithms use an unsupervised strategy to assign cell types for SRT data. They first conduct clustering analysis and then aggregate cluster-level expression based on the clustering results. This workflow fails to leverage the marker gene information efficiently. On the other hand, other cell annotation methods designed for single-cell RNA-seq data utilize the cell-type marker genes information but fail to use spatial information in SRT data. RESULTS: We introduce a statistical spatial transcriptomics cell assignment model, SPAN, to annotate clusters of cells or spots into known types in SRT data with prior knowledge of predefined marker genes and spatial information. The SPAN model annotates cells or spots from SRT data using predefined overexpressed marker genes and combines a mixture model with a hidden Markov random field to model the spatial dependency between neighboring spots. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SPAN against spatial and nonspatial clustering algorithms through extensive simulation and real data experiments. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: https://github.com/ChengZ352/SPAN.
37207338	2023	Nucleic acids research	PanDrugs2: prioritizing cancer therapies using integrated individual multi-omics data.	Genomics studies routinely confront researchers with long lists of tumor alterations detected in patients. Such lists are difficult to interpret since only a minority of the alterations are relevant biomarkers for diagnosis and for designing therapeutic strategies. PanDrugs is a methodology that facilitates the interpretation of tumor molecular alterations and guides the selection of personalized treatments. To do so, PanDrugs scores gene actionability and drug feasibility to provide a prioritized evidence-based list of drugs. Here, we introduce PanDrugs2, a major upgrade of PanDrugs that, in addition to somatic variant analysis, supports a new integrated multi-omics analysis which simultaneously combines somatic and germline variants, copy number variation and gene expression data. Moreover, PanDrugs2 now considers cancer genetic dependencies to extend tumor vulnerabilities providing therapeutic options for untargetable genes. Importantly, a novel intuitive report to support clinical decision-making is generated. PanDrugs database has been updated, integrating 23 primary sources that support >74K drug-gene associations obtained from 4642 genes and 14 659 unique compounds. The database has also been reimplemented to allow semi-automatic updates to facilitate maintenance and release of future versions. PanDrugs2 does not require login and is freely available at https://www.pandrugs.org/.
41249656	2025	Nature methods	A multi-omics molecular landscape of 30 tissues in aging female rhesus macaques.	A systematic investigation of aging patterns across virtually all major tissues in nonhuman primates, our evolutionarily closest relatives, can provide valuable insights into tissue aging in humans, which is still elusive largely due to the difficulty in sampling. Here, we generated and analyzed multi-omics data, including transcriptome, proteome and metabolome, from 30 tissues of 17 female rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) aged 3-27 years. We found that certain molecular features, such as increased inflammation, are consistent across tissues and align with findings in mice and humans. We further revealed that tissue aging in macaques is asynchronous and can be classified into two distinct types, with one type exhibiting more pronounced aging degree, likely associated with decreased mRNA translation efficiency, and predominantly contributing to whole-body aging. This work provides a comprehensive molecular landscape of aging in nonhuman primate tissues and links translation efficiency to tissue-specific aging.
39400332	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Xenomake: a pipeline for processing and sorting xenograft reads from spatial transcriptomic experiments.	SUMMARY: Xenograft models are attractive models that mimic human tumor biology and permit one to perturb the tumor microenvironment and study its drug response. Spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) provides a powerful way to study the organization of xenograft models, but currently there is a lack of specialized pipeline for processing xenograft reads originated from SRT experiments. Xenomake is a standalone pipeline for the automated handling of spatial xenograft reads. Xenomake handles read processing, alignment, xenograft read sorting, and connects well with downstream spatial analysis packages. We additionally show that Xenomake can correctly assign organism-specific reads, reduce sparsity of data by increasing gene counts, while maintaining biological relevance for studies. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Xenomake is an open-source program that is available on Github (https://github.com/qianzhulab/Xenomake). Complete documentation can be found at the link.
40258059	2025	PLoS computational biology	Revealing cancer driver genes through integrative transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses with Moonlight.	Cancer involves dynamic changes caused by (epi)genetic alterations such as mutations or abnormal DNA methylation patterns which occur in cancer driver genes. These driver genes are divided into oncogenes and tumor suppressors depending on their function and mechanism of action. Discovering driver genes in different cancer (sub)types is important not only for increasing current understanding of carcinogenesis but also from prognostic and therapeutic perspectives. We have previously developed a framework called Moonlight which uses a systems biology multi-omics approach for prediction of driver genes. Here, we present an important development in Moonlight2 by incorporating a DNA methylation layer which provides epigenetic evidence for deregulated expression profiles of driver genes. To this end, we present a novel functionality called Gene Methylation Analysis (GMA) which investigates abnormal DNA methylation patterns to predict driver genes. This is achieved by integrating the tool EpiMix which is designed to detect such aberrant DNA methylation patterns in a cohort of patients and further couples these patterns with gene expression changes. To showcase GMA, we applied it to three cancer (sub)types (basal-like breast cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, and thyroid carcinoma) where we discovered 33, 190, and 263 epigenetically driven genes, respectively. A subset of these driver genes had prognostic effects with expression levels significantly affecting survival of the patients. Moreover, a subset of the driver genes demonstrated therapeutic potential as drug targets. This study provides a framework for exploring the driving forces behind cancer and provides novel insights into the landscape of three cancer sub(types) by integrating gene expression and methylation data.
40062614	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Learning directed acyclic graphs for ligands and receptors based on spatially resolved transcriptomic data of ovarian cancer.	To unravel the mechanism of immune activation and suppression within tumors, a critical step is to identify transcriptional signals governing cell-cell communication between tumor and immune/stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment. Central to this communication are interactions between secreted ligands and cell-surface receptors, creating a highly connected signaling network among cells. Recent advancements in in situ-omics profiling, particularly spatial transcriptomic (ST) technology, provide unique opportunities to directly characterize ligand-receptor signaling networks that power cell-cell communication. In this paper, we propose a novel statistical method, LRnetST, to characterize the ligand-receptor interaction networks between adjacent tumor and immune/stroma cells based on ST data. LRnetST utilizes a directed acyclic graph model with a novel approach to handle the zero-inflated distributions of ST data. It also leverages existing ligand-receptor regulation databases as prior information, and employs a bootstrap aggregation strategy to achieve robust network estimation. Application of LRnetST to ST data of high-grade serous ovarian tumor samples revealed both common and distinct ligand-receptor regulations across different tumors. Some of these interactions were validated through both a MERFISH dataset and a CosMx SMI dataset of independent ovarian tumor samples. These results cast light on biological processes relating to the communication between tumor and immune/stromal cells in ovarian tumors. An open-source R package of LRnetST is available on GitHub at https://github.com/jie108/LRnetST.
37798249	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	SpaRx: elucidate single-cell spatial heterogeneity of drug responses for personalized treatment.	Spatial cellular authors heterogeneity contributes to differential drug responses in a tumor lesion and potential therapeutic resistance. Recent emerging spatial technologies such as CosMx, MERSCOPE and Xenium delineate the spatial gene expression patterns at the single cell resolution. This provides unprecedented opportunities to identify spatially localized cellular resistance and to optimize the treatment for individual patients. In this work, we present a graph-based domain adaptation model, SpaRx, to reveal the heterogeneity of spatial cellular response to drugs. SpaRx transfers the knowledge from pharmacogenomics profiles to single-cell spatial transcriptomics data, through hybrid learning with dynamic adversarial adaption. Comprehensive benchmarking demonstrates the superior and robust performance of SpaRx at different dropout rates, noise levels and transcriptomics coverage. Further application of SpaRx to the state-of-the-art single-cell spatial transcriptomics data reveals that tumor cells in different locations of a tumor lesion present heterogenous sensitivity or resistance to drugs. Moreover, resistant tumor cells interact with themselves or the surrounding constituents to form an ecosystem for drug resistance. Collectively, SpaRx characterizes the spatial therapeutic variability, unveils the molecular mechanisms underpinning drug resistance and identifies personalized drug targets and effective drug combinations.
34358288	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Assessing heterogeneity in spatial data using the HTA index with applications to spatial transcriptomics and imaging.	MOTIVATION: Tumour heterogeneity is being increasingly recognized as an important characteristic of cancer and as a determinant of prognosis and treatment outcome. Emerging spatial transcriptomics data hold the potential to further our understanding of tumour heterogeneity and its implications. However, existing statistical tools are not sufficiently powerful to capture heterogeneity in the complex setting of spatial molecular biology. RESULTS: We provide a statistical solution, the HeTerogeneity Average index (HTA), specifically designed to handle the multivariate nature of spatial transcriptomics. We prove that HTA has an approximately normal distribution, therefore lending itself to efficient statistical assessment and inference. We first demonstrate that HTA accurately reflects the level of heterogeneity in simulated data. We then use HTA to analyze heterogeneity in two cancer spatial transcriptomics datasets: spatial RNA sequencing by 10x Genomics and spatial transcriptomics inferred from H&E. Finally, we demonstrate that HTA also applies to 3D spatial data using brain MRI. In spatial RNA sequencing, we use a known combination of molecular traits to assert that HTA aligns with the expected outcome for this combination. We also show that HTA captures immune-cell infiltration at multiple resolutions. In digital pathology, we show how HTA can be used in survival analysis and demonstrate that high levels of heterogeneity may be linked to poor survival. In brain MRI, we show that HTA differentiates between normal ageing, Alzheimer's disease and two tumours. HTA also extends beyond molecular biology and medical imaging, and can be applied to many domains, including GIS. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Python package and source code are available at: https://github.com/alonalj/hta. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
41002029	2025	Nucleic acids research	gwSPADE: gene frequency-weighted reference-free deconvolution in spatial transcriptomics.	Most spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies (e.g. 10x Visium) operate at the multicellular level, where each spatial location often contains a mixture of cells with heterogeneous cell types. Thus, effective deconvolution of cell type compositions is critical for downstream analysis. Although reference-based deconvolution methods have been proposed, they depend on the availability of reference data, which may not always be accessible. Additionally, within a deconvolved cell type, cellular heterogeneity may still exist, requiring further deconvolution to uncover finer structures for a better understanding of this complexity. Here, we present gwSPADE, a gene frequency-weighted reference-free SPAtial DEconvolution method for ST data. gwSPADE requires only the gene count matrix and utilizes appropriate weighting schemes within a topic model to accurately recover cell type transcriptional profiles and their proportions at each spatial location, without relying on external single-cell reference information. In various simulations and real data analyses, gwSPADE demonstrates scalability across various platforms and shows superior performance over existing reference-free deconvolution methods such as STdeconvolve.
39377396	2025	Nucleic acids research	PerturBase: a comprehensive database for single-cell perturbation data analysis and visualization.	Single-cell perturbation (scPerturbation) sequencing techniques, represented by single-cell genetic perturbation (e.g. Perturb-seq) and single-cell chemical perturbation (e.g. sci-Plex), result from the integration of single-cell toolkits with conventional bulk screening methods. These innovative sequencing techniques empower researchers to dissect perturbation effects in biological systems at an unprecedented resolution. Despite these advancements, a notable gap exists in the availability of a dedicated database for exploring scPerturbation data. To address this gap, we present PerturBase, the most comprehensive database designed for the analysis and visualization of scPerturbation data (http://www.perturbase.cn/). PerturBase curates 122 datasets from 46 publicly available studies, covering 115 single-modal and 7 multi-modal datasets that include 24 254 genetic and 230 chemical perturbations from approximately 5 million cells. The database, comprising the 'Dataset' and 'Perturbation' modules, provides insights into various results, encompassing quality control, denoising, differential gene expression analysis, functional analysis of perturbation effects and characterization of relationships between perturbations. All the datasets and results are presented on user-friendly, easy-to-browse web pages and can be visualized through intuitive and interactive plot and table formats. In summary, PerturBase stands as a pioneering, high-content database intended for searching, visualizing and analyzing scPerturbation datasets, contributing to a deeper understanding of perturbation effects.
40856525	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	sCIN: a contrastive learning framework for single-cell multi-omics data integration.	The rapid advancement of single-cell omics technologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing and single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high throughput sequencing has transformed our understanding of cellular heterogeneity and regulatory mechanisms. However, integrating these data types remains challenging due to distributional discrepancies and distinct feature spaces. To address this, we present a novel single-cell Contrastive INtegration framework (sCIN) that integrates different omics modalities into a shared low-dimensional latent space. sCIN uses modality-specific encoders and contrastive learning to generate latent representations for each modality, aligning cells across modalities and removing technology-specific biases. The framework was designed to rigorously prevent data leakage between training and testing, and was extensively evaluated on three real-world paired datasets namely simultaneous high-throughput ATAC and RNA expression with sequencing, 10X PBMC (10k version), and cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes, and one unpaired dataset of gene expression and chromatin accessibility. Paired datasets refer to multi-omics data generated using technologies capable of capturing different omics features from the same cell population while unpaired datasets are measured from different cell populations from a tissue. Results on paired and unpaired datasets show that sCIN outperforms state-of-the-art models, including scGLUE, scBridge, sciCAN, Con-AAE, Harmony, and MOFA+, across multiple metrics: average silhouette width for clustering quality, Recall@k, cell type@k, cell type accuracy, and median rank for integration quality. Moreover, sCIN was evaluated on simulated unpaired datasets derived from paired data, demonstrating its ability to leverage available biological information for effective multimodal integration. In summary, sCIN reliably integrates omics modalities while preserving biological meaning in both paired and unpaired settings.
41249066	2025	Genome research	Joint imputation and deconvolution of gene expression across spatial transcriptomics platforms.	Spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) technologies measure gene expression across thousands of spatial locations within a tissue slice. Multiple SRT technologies are currently available and others are in active development, with each technology having varying spatial resolution (subcellular, single-cell, or multicellular regions), gene coverage (targeted vs. whole-transcriptome), and sequencing depth per location. For example, the widely used 10x Genomics Visium platform measures whole transcriptomes from multiple-cell-sized spots, whereas the 10x Genomics Xenium platform measures a few hundred genes at subcellular resolution. A number of studies apply multiple SRT technologies to slices that originate from the same biological tissue. Integration of data from different SRT technologies can overcome limitations of the individual technologies, enabling the imputation of expression from unmeasured genes in targeted technologies and/or the deconvolution of admixed expression from technologies with lower spatial resolution. Here, we introduce Spatial Integration for Imputation and Deconvolution (SIID), an algorithm to reconstruct a latent spatial gene expression matrix from a pair of observations from different SRT technologies. SIID leverages a spatial alignment and uses a joint nonnegative factorization model to accurately impute missing gene expression and infer gene expression signatures of cell types from admixed SRT data. In simulations involving paired SRT data sets from different technologies (e.g., Xenium and Visium), SIID shows superior performance in reconstructing spot-to-cell-type assignments, recovering cell type-specific gene expression and imputing missing data compared to contemporary tools. When applied to real-world 10x Xenium-Visium pairs from human breast and colon cancer tissues, SIID achieves highest performance in imputing holdout gene expression.
39406520	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	BANDRP: a bilinear attention network for anti-cancer drug response prediction based on fingerprint and multi-omics.	Predicting anti-cancer drug response can help with personalized cancer treatment and is an important topic in modern oncology research. Although some methods have been used for anti-cancer drug response prediction, how to effectively integrate various features related to cancer cell lines, drugs, and their known responses is still affected by the redundant information of input features and the complex interactions between features. In this study, we propose a bilinear attention model, named BANDRP, based on multiple omics data of cancer cell lines and multiple molecular fingerprints of drugs to predict potential anti-cancer drug responses. Compared with existing models, BANDRP uses gene expression data to calculate pathway enrichment scores to enrich the features of cancer cell lines and can automatically learn the interactive information of cancer cell lines and drugs through bilinear attention networks. Benchmarking and independent tests demonstrate that BANDRP surpasses baseline models and exhibits robust generalization performance. Ablation experiments affirm the optimality of the current model architecture and feature selection scheme for our prediction task. Furthermore, analytical experiments and case studies on unknown anti-cancer drug response predictions underscore BANDRP's potential as a potent and reliable framework for predicting anti-cancer drug response.
34028557	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Deep cross-omics cycle attention model for joint analysis of single-cell multi-omics data.	MOTIVATION: Joint profiling of single-cell transcriptomics and epigenomics data enables us to characterize cell states and transcriptomics regulatory programs related to cellular heterogeneity. However, the highly different features on sparsity, heterogeneity and dimensionality between multi-omics data have severely hindered its integrative analysis. RESULTS: We proposed deep cross-omics cycle attention (DCCA) model, a computational tool for joint analysis of single-cell multi-omics data, by combining variational autoencoders (VAEs) and attention-transfer. Specifically, we show that DCCA can leverage one omics data to fine-tune the network trained for another omics data, given a dataset of parallel multi-omics data within the same cell. Studies on both simulated and real datasets from various platforms, DCCA demonstrates its superior capability: (i) dissecting cellular heterogeneity; (ii) denoising and aggregating data and (iii) constructing the link between multi-omics data, which is used to infer new transcriptional regulatory relations. In our applications, DCCA was demonstrated to have a superior power to generate missing stages or omics in a biologically meaningful manner, which provides a new way to analyze and also understand complicated biological processes. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: DCCA source code is available at https://github.com/cmzuo11/DCCA, and has been deposited in archived format at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4762065. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
34125906	2021	Nucleic acids research	TIMEOR: a web-based tool to uncover temporal regulatory mechanisms from multi-omics data.	Uncovering how transcription factors regulate their targets at DNA, RNA and protein levels over time is critical to define gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and assign mechanisms in normal and diseased states. RNA-seq is a standard method measuring gene regulation using an established set of analysis stages. However, none of the currently available pipeline methods for interpreting ordered genomic data (in time or space) use time-series models to assign cause and effect relationships within GRNs, are adaptive to diverse experimental designs, or enable user interpretation through a web-based platform. Furthermore, methods integrating ordered RNA-seq data with protein-DNA binding data to distinguish direct from indirect interactions are urgently needed. We present TIMEOR (Trajectory Inference and Mechanism Exploration with Omics data in R), the first web-based and adaptive time-series multi-omics pipeline method which infers the relationship between gene regulatory events across time. TIMEOR addresses the critical need for methods to determine causal regulatory mechanism networks by leveraging time-series RNA-seq, motif analysis, protein-DNA binding data, and protein-protein interaction networks. TIMEOR's user-catered approach helps non-coders generate new hypotheses and validate known mechanisms. We used TIMEOR to identify a novel link between insulin stimulation and the circadian rhythm cycle. TIMEOR is available at https://github.com/ashleymaeconard/TIMEOR.git and http://timeor.brown.edu.
37864231	2023	Genome biology	SPIRAL: integrating and aligning spatially resolved transcriptomics data across different experiments, conditions, and technologies.	Properly integrating spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) generated from different batches into a unified gene-spatial coordinate system could enable the construction of a comprehensive spatial transcriptome atlas. Here, we propose SPIRAL, consisting of two consecutive modules: SPIRAL-integration, with graph domain adaptation-based data integration, and SPIRAL-alignment, with cluster-aware optimal transport-based coordination alignment. We verify SPIRAL with both synthetic and real SRT datasets. By encoding spatial correlations to gene expressions, SPIRAL-integration surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both batch effect removal and joint spatial domain identification. By aligning spots cluster-wise, SPIRAL-alignment achieves more accurate coordinate alignments than existing methods.

40707940	2025	Genome biology	Modeling combinatorial regulation from single-cell multi-omics provides regulatory units underpinning cell type landscape using cRegulon.	Advances in single-cell technology enable large-scale generation of omics data, promising for clarifying gene regulatory networks governing different cell type/states. Nonetheless, prevailing methods fail to account for universal and reusable regulatory modules in GRNs, which are fundamental underpinnings of cell type landscape. We introduce cRegulon to infer regulatory modules by modeling combinatorial regulation of transcription factors based on diverse GRNs from single-cell multi-omics data. Through benchmarking and applications using simulated datasets and real datasets, cRegulon outperforms existing approaches in identifying TF combinatorial modules as regulatory units and annotating cell types. cRegulon offers new insights and methodology into combinatorial regulation.
41243976	2025	Nucleic acids research	Spatial GWAS Atlas: a knowledgebase for decoding the genetic architecture of complex traits in spatial resolution.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a large number of variants linked to complex traits and diseases, most of which lie in noncoding regions and act in a tissue- and cell type-specific manner. However, how these genetic effects are distributed within the spatial architecture of tissues remains poorly understood. Spatial transcriptomics (ST) profiles gene expression while preserving spatial coordinates, offering a powerful way to localize genetic effects within tissue architecture. Here, we present the Spatial GWAS Atlas (https://zhaolab.cpl.ac.cn/spatialgwas), the first comprehensive resource systematically integrating GWAS summary statistics with ST data to map trait-associated cells at single-cell resolution with spatial context. By leveraging 3854 curated GWAS datasets spanning diverse traits and 635 ST datasets across multiple species, tissues, and platforms, we identified extensive trait-region and trait-spot associations. The database provides keyword search, multicriteria browsing, interactive visualization, and bulk download capabilities. By linking genetic association signals to spatially resolved transcriptomics, the Spatial GWAS Atlas enables high-resolution dissection of the cellular and spatial basis of complex traits, facilitating mechanistic studies, therapeutic target discovery, and precision medicine applications.
39851073	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	scMMAE: masked cross-attention network for single-cell multimodal omics fusion to enhance unimodal omics.	Multimodal omics provide deeper insight into the biological processes and cellular functions, especially transcriptomics and proteomics. Computational methods have been proposed for the integration of single-cell multimodal omics of transcriptomics and proteomics. However, existing methods primarily concentrate on the alignment of different omics, overlooking the unique information inherent in each omics type. Moreover, as the majority of single-cell cohorts only encompass one omics, it becomes critical to transfer the knowledge learnt from multimodal omics to enhance unimodal omics analysis. Therefore, we proposed a novel framework that leverages masked autoencoder with cross-attention mechanism, called scMMAE (single-cell multimodal masked autoencoder), to fuse multimodal omics and enhance unimodal omics analysis. scMMAE simultaneously captures both the shared features and the distinctive information of two single-cell omics modalities and transfers the knowledge to enhance single-cell transcriptome data. Comparative evaluations against benchmarking methods across various cohorts revealed a notable improvement, with an increase of up to 21% in the adjusted Rand index and up to 12% in normalized mutual information in the context of multimodal fusion. In the realm of unimodal omics, scMMAE demonstrated an overall enhancement of approximately 20% in the adjusted Rand index and nearly 10% in normalized mutual information. Other nine metrics, including the Fowlkes-Mallows index and silhouette coefficient, further underscored the high performance of scMMAE. Significantly, scMMAE exhibits an elevated level of proficiency in distinguishing between different cell types, particularly on CD4 and CD8 T cells. Availability and implementation: scMMAE source code at https://github.com/DM0815/scMMAE/.
40923764	2025	Nucleic acids research	FmH2ST: foundation model-based spatial transcriptomics generation from histological images.	Spatial transcriptomics (ST) reveals gene expression distributions within tissues. Yet, predicting spatial gene expression from histological images still faces the challenges of limited ST data that lack prior knowledge, and insufficient capturing of inter-slice heterogeneity and intra-slice complexity. To tackle these challenges, we introduce FmH2ST, a foundation model-based method for spatial gene expression prediction. Equipped with powerful foundation models pretrained on massive images, FmH2ST employs a dual-branch framework to integrate prior knowledge from foundation model and fine-grained details from spot images. The foundation model branch employs a multilevel feature extraction strategy to obtain enriched features with slice context for capturing inter-slice heterogeneity, and a dual-graph strategy to obtain spatial and semantic enriched features for modeling intra-slice complexity. The spot-specific learning branch leverages multiscale convolutions, Transformer, and graph neural network to extract fine-grained spot features. The outputs of two branches are adaptively fused for better prediction under a collaborative branch learning strategy. Experimental results show FmH2ST outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets. FmH2ST can denoise the raw gene expressions, reveal cancer spatial heterogeneity and gene co-expression patterns, and support the inference of gene regulatory networks. Overall, FmH2ST is effective for predicting ST, with potential applications in clinical diagnostics and personalized treatment.
34762640	2021	PLoS computational biology	Optimizing network propagation for multi-omics data integration.	Network propagation refers to a class of algorithms that integrate information from input data across connected nodes in a given network. These algorithms have wide applications in systems biology, protein function prediction, inferring condition-specifically altered sub-networks, and prioritizing disease genes. Despite the popularity of network propagation, there is a lack of comparative analyses of different algorithms on real data and little guidance on how to select and parameterize the various algorithms. Here, we address this problem by analyzing different combinations of network normalization and propagation methods and by demonstrating schemes for the identification of optimal parameter settings on real proteome and transcriptome data. Our work highlights the risk of a 'topology bias' caused by the incorrect use of network normalization approaches. Capitalizing on the fact that network propagation is a regularization approach, we show that minimizing the bias-variance tradeoff can be utilized for selecting optimal parameters. The application to real multi-omics data demonstrated that optimal parameters could also be obtained by either maximizing the agreement between different omics layers (e.g. proteome and transcriptome) or by maximizing the consistency between biological replicates. Furthermore, we exemplified the utility and robustness of network propagation on multi-omics datasets for identifying ageing-associated genes in brain and liver tissues of rats and for elucidating molecular mechanisms underlying prostate cancer progression. Overall, this work compares different network propagation approaches and it presents strategies for how to use network propagation algorithms to optimally address a specific research question at hand.

39879386	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Inferring the genetic relationships between unsupervised deep learning-derived imaging phenotypes and glioblastoma through multi-omics approaches.	This study aimed to investigate the genetic association between glioblastoma (GBM) and unsupervised deep learning-derived imaging phenotypes (UDIPs). We employed a combination of genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), and scPagwas (pathway-based polygenic regression framework) methods to explore the genetic links between UDIPs and GBM. Two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses were conducted to identify causal relationships between UDIPs and GBM. Colocalization analysis was performed to validate genetic associations, while scPagwas analysis was used to evaluate the relevance of key UDIPs to GBM at the cellular level. Among 512 UDIPs tested, 23 were found to have significant causal associations with GBM. Notably, UDIPs such as T1-33 (OR = 1.007, 95% CI = 1.001 to 1.012, P = .022), T1-34 (OR = 1.012, 95% CI = 1.001-1.023, P = .028), and T1-96 (OR = 1.009, 95% CI = 1.001-1.019, P = .046) were found to have a genetic association with GBM. Furthermore, T1-34 and T1-96 were significantly associated with GBM recurrence, with P-values < .0001 and P < .001, respectively. In addition, scPagwas analysis revealed that T1-33, T1-34, and T1-96 are distinctively linked to different GBM subtypes, with T1-33 showing strong associations with the neural progenitor-like subtype (NPC2), T1-34 with mesenchymal (MES2) and neural progenitor (NPC1) cells, and T1-96 with the NPC2 subtype. T1-33, T1-34, and T1-96 hold significant potential for predicting tumor recurrence and aiding in the development of personalized GBM treatment strategies.
38670157	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Prior knowledge-guided multilevel graph neural network for tumor risk prediction and interpretation via multi-omics data integration.	The interrelation and complementary nature of multi-omics data can provide valuable insights into the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying diseases. However, challenges such as limited sample size, high data dimensionality and differences in omics modalities pose significant obstacles to fully harnessing the potential of these data. The prior knowledge such as gene regulatory network and pathway information harbors useful gene-gene interaction and gene functional module information. To effectively integrate multi-omics data and make full use of the prior knowledge, here, we propose a Multilevel-graph neural network (GNN): a hierarchically designed deep learning algorithm that sequentially leverages multi-omics data, gene regulatory networks and pathway information to extract features and enhance accuracy in predicting survival risk. Our method achieved better accuracy compared with existing methods. Furthermore, key factors nonlinearly associated with the tumor pathogenesis are prioritized by employing two interpretation algorithms (i.e. GNN-Explainer and IGscore) for neural networks, at gene and pathway level, respectively. The top genes and pathways exhibit strong associations with disease in survival analyses, many of which such as SEC61G and CYP27B1 are previously reported in the literature.
39909714	2025	Genome research	Kernel-bounded clustering for spatial transcriptomics enables scalable discovery of complex spatial domains.	Spatial transcriptomics are a collection of technologies that have enabled characterization of gene expression profiles and spatial information in tissue samples. Existing methods for clustering spatial transcriptomics data have primarily focused on data transformation techniques to represent the data suitably for subsequent clustering analysis, often using an existing clustering algorithm. These methods have limitations in handling complex data characteristics with varying densities, sizes, and shapes (in the transformed space on which clustering is performed), and they have high computational complexity, resulting in unsatisfactory clustering outcomes and slow execution time even with GPUs. Rather than focusing on data transformation techniques, we propose a new clustering algorithm called kernel-bounded clustering (KBC). It has two unique features: (1) It is the first clustering algorithm that employs a distributional kernel to recruit members of a cluster, enabling clusters of varying densities, sizes, and shapes to be discovered, and (2) it is a linear-time clustering algorithm that significantly enhances the speed of clustering analysis, enabling researchers to effectively handle large-scale spatial transcriptomics data sets. We show that (1) KBC works well with a simple data transformation technique called the Weisfeiler-Lehman scheme, and (2) a combination of KBC and the Weisfeiler-Lehman scheme produces good clustering outcomes, and it is faster and easier-to-use than many methods that employ existing clustering algorithms and data transformation techniques.
32093753	2020	Genome biology	Linked optical and gene expression profiling of single cells at high-throughput.	Single-cell RNA sequencing has emerged as a powerful tool for characterizing cells, but not all phenotypes of interest can be observed through changes in gene expression. Linking sequencing with optical analysis has provided insight into the molecular basis of cellular function, but current approaches have limited throughput. Here, we present a high-throughput platform for linked optical and gene expression profiling of single cells. We demonstrate accurate fluorescence and gene expression measurements on thousands of cells in a single experiment. We use the platform to characterize DNA and RNA changes through the cell cycle and correlate antibody fluorescence with gene expression. The platform's ability to isolate rare cell subsets and perform multiple measurements, including fluorescence and sequencing-based analysis, holds potential for scalable multi-modal single-cell analysis.
34086847	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scAMACE: model-based approach to the joint analysis of single-cell data on chromatin accessibility, gene expression and methylation.	MOTIVATION: The advancement in technologies and the growth of available single-cell datasets motivate integrative analysis of multiple single-cell genomic datasets. Integrative analysis of multimodal single-cell datasets combines complementary information offered by single-omic datasets and can offer deeper insights on complex biological process. Clustering methods that identify the unknown cell types are among the first few steps in the analysis of single-cell datasets, and they are important for downstream analysis built upon the identified cell types. RESULTS: We propose scAMACE for the integrative analysis and clustering of single-cell data on chromatin accessibility, gene expression and methylation. We demonstrate that cell types are better identified and characterized through analyzing the three data types jointly.

41159730	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Single-cell multi-omics and machine learning for dissecting stemness in cancer.	Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a subpopulation of tumor cells with self-renewal capacity and the ability to drive tumor growth, metastasis, and relapse. They are widely recognized as major contributors to therapeutic resistance. Despite extensive efforts to characterize and target CSCs, their elusive nature continues to drive therapeutic resistance and relapse in epithelial malignancies. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has transformed our understanding of tumor biology. It enables high-resolution profiling of rare subpopulations (<5%) and reveals the functional heterogeneity that contributes to treatment failure. In this review, we discuss evolving evidence for a paradigm shift, enabled by rapidly advancing single-cell technologies, from a static, marker-based definition of CSCs to a dynamic and functional perspective. We explore how trajectory inference and spatial transcriptomics redefine stemness by context-dependent dynamic-state modelling. We also highlight emerging platforms, including artificial intelligence-driven predictive modelling, multi-omics integration, and functional CRISPR screens. These approaches have the potential to uncover new vulnerabilities in CSC populations. Together, these advances should lead to new precision medicine strategies for disrupting CSC plasticity, niche adaptation, and immune evasion.
39748324	2025	Genome biology	Spatiotemporal dynamics of early oogenesis in pigs.	"BACKGROUND: In humans and other mammals, the process of oogenesis initiates asynchronously in specific ovarian regions, leading to the localization of dormant and growing follicles in the cortex and medulla, respectively; however, the current understanding of this process remains insufficient. RESULTS: Here, we integrate single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics (ST) to comprehend spatial-temporal gene expression profiles and explore the spatial organization of ovarian microenvironments during early oogenesis in pigs. Projection of the germ cell clusters at different stages of oogenesis into the spatial atlas unveils a ""cortical to medullary (C-M)"" distribution of germ cells in the developing porcine ovaries. Cross-species analysis between pigs and humans unveils a conserved C-M distribution pattern of germ cells during oogenesis, highlighting the utility of pigs as valuable models for studying human oogenesis in a spatial context. RNA velocity analysis with ST identifies the molecular characteristics and spatial dynamics of granulosa cell lineages originating from the cortical and medullary regions in pig ovaries. Spatial co-occurrence analysis and intercellular communication analysis unveils a distinct cell-cell communication pattern between germ cells and somatic cells in the cortex and medulla regions. Notably, in vitro culture of ovarian tissues verifies that intercellular NOTCH signaling and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins played crucial roles in initiating meiotic and oogenic programs, highlighting an underappreciated role of ovarian microenvironments in orchestrating germ cell fates. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our work provides insight into the spatial characteristics of early oogenesis and the regulatory role of ovarian microenvironments in germ cell fate within a spatial context."
37985875	2024	Nature biotechnology	Spatial metatranscriptomics resolves host-bacteria-fungi interactomes.	The interactions of microorganisms among themselves and with their multicellular host take place at the microscale, forming complex networks and spatial patterns. Existing technology does not allow the simultaneous investigation of spatial interactions between a host and the multitude of its colonizing microorganisms, which limits our understanding of host-microorganism interactions within a plant or animal tissue. Here we present spatial metatranscriptomics (SmT), a sequencing-based approach that leverages 16S/18S/ITS/poly-d(T) multimodal arrays for simultaneous host transcriptome- and microbiome-wide characterization of tissues at 55-microm resolution. We showcase SmT in outdoor-grown Arabidopsis thaliana leaves as a model system, and find tissue-scale bacterial and fungal hotspots. By network analysis, we study inter- and intrakingdom spatial interactions among microorganisms, as well as the host response to microbial hotspots. SmT provides an approach for answering fundamental questions on host-microbiome interplay.
41020524	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	soFusion: facilitating tissue structure identification via spatial multi-omics data fusion.	The rapid advancement of spatial multi-omics technologies has opened new avenues for dissecting tissue architecture with unprecedented resolution. However, inherent disparities across omics modalities, such as differences in biological hierarchy and resolution, pose significant challenges for integrative analysis. To address this, we present soFusion, a method for representation learning on spatial multi-omics data that enables automated identification of tissue compartmentalization. soFusion employs a graph convolutional network (GCN) to extract latent embeddings from spatial omics profiles. To simultaneously capture both cross-modality relationships and modality-specific features, we introduce a novel strategy for intra- and inter-omics feature learning. Moreover, modality-specific decoders are designed to preserve the unique information embedded in each omics type. We evaluated soFusion on multiple datasets including gene expression, protein expression, and epigenetic features. Across all benchmarks, soFusion consistently outperformed existing methods in delineating anatomical structures and identifying spatial domains with improved continuity and reduced noise. Collectively, soFusion offers an effective solution for spatial multi-omics integration, substantially enhancing the robustness of spatial domain identification.
38225676	2024	Genome biology	Evaluating spatially variable gene detection methods for spatial transcriptomics data.	BACKGROUND: The identification of genes that vary across spatial domains in tissues and cells is an essential step for spatial transcriptomics data analysis. Given the critical role it serves for downstream data interpretations, various methods for detecting spatially variable genes (SVGs) have been proposed. However, the lack of benchmarking complicates the selection of a suitable method. RESULTS: Here we systematically evaluate a panel of popular SVG detection methods on a large collection of spatial transcriptomics datasets, covering various tissue types, biotechnologies, and spatial resolutions. We address questions including whether different methods select a similar set of SVGs, how reliable is the reported statistical significance from each method, how accurate and robust is each method in terms of SVG detection, and how well the selected SVGs perform in downstream applications such as clustering of spatial domains. Besides these, practical considerations such as computational time and memory usage are also crucial for deciding which method to use. CONCLUSIONS: Our study evaluates the performance of each method from multiple aspects and highlights the discrepancy among different methods when calling statistically significant SVGs across diverse datasets. Overall, our work provides useful considerations for choosing methods for identifying SVGs and serves as a key reference for the future development of related methods.
39038934	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	MetalinksDB: a flexible and contextualizable resource of metabolite-protein interactions.	From the catalytic breakdown of nutrients to signaling, interactions between metabolites and proteins play an essential role in cellular function. An important case is cell-cell communication, where metabolites, secreted into the microenvironment, initiate signaling cascades by binding to intra- or extracellular receptors of neighboring cells. Protein-protein cell-cell communication interactions are routinely predicted from transcriptomic data. However, inferring metabolite-mediated intercellular signaling remains challenging, partially due to the limited size of intercellular prior knowledge resources focused on metabolites. Here, we leverage knowledge-graph infrastructure to integrate generalistic metabolite-protein with curated metabolite-receptor resources to create MetalinksDB. MetalinksDB is an order of magnitude larger than existing metabolite-receptor resources and can be tailored to specific biological contexts, such as diseases, pathways, or tissue/cellular locations. We demonstrate MetalinksDB's utility in identifying deregulated processes in renal cancer using multi-omics bulk data. Furthermore, we infer metabolite-driven intercellular signaling in acute kidney injury using spatial transcriptomics data. MetalinksDB is a comprehensive and customizable database of intercellular metabolite-protein interactions, accessible via a web interface (https://metalinks.omnipathdb.org/) and programmatically as a knowledge graph (https://github.com/biocypher/metalinks). We anticipate that by enabling diverse analyses tailored to specific biological contexts, MetalinksDB will facilitate the discovery of disease-relevant metabolite-mediated intercellular signaling processes.
38819254	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	PIPET: predicting relevant subpopulations in single-cell data using phenotypic information from bulk data.	Single-cell RNA sequencing has revealed cellular heterogeneity in complex tissues, notably benefiting research on diseases such as cancer. However, the integration of single-cell data from small samples with extensive clinical features in bulk data remains underexplored. In this study, we introduce PIPET, an algorithmic method for predicting relevant subpopulations in single-cell data based on multivariate phenotypic information from bulk data. PIPET generates feature vectors for each phenotype from differentially expressed genes in bulk data and then identifies relevant cellular subpopulations by assessing the similarity between single-cell data and these vectors. Subsequently, phenotype-related cell states can be analyzed based on these subpopulations. In simulated datasets, PIPET showed robust performance in predicting multiclassification cellular subpopulations. Application of PIPET to lung adenocarcinoma single-cell RNA sequencing data revealed cellular subpopulations with poor survival and associations with TP53 mutations. Similarly, in breast cancer single-cell data, PIPET identified cellular subpopulations associated with the PAM50 clinical subtypes and triple-negative breast cancer subtypes. Overall, PIPET effectively identified relevant cellular subpopulations in single-cell data, guided by phenotypic information from bulk data. This approach comprehensively delineates the molecular characteristics of each cellular subpopulation, offering insights into disease-related subpopulations and guiding personalized treatment strategies.
32706024	2020	Briefings in bioinformatics	Bioinformatics-assisted, integrated omics studies on medicinal plants.	The immense therapeutic and economic values of medicinal plants have attracted increasing attention from the worldwide researchers. It has been recognized that production of the authentic and high-quality herbal drugs became the prerequisite for maintaining the healthy development of the traditional medicine industry. To this end, intensive research efforts have been devoted to the basic studies, in order to pave a way for standardized authentication of the plant materials, and bioengineering of the metabolic pathways in the medicinal plants. In this paper, the recent advances of omics studies on the medicinal plants were summarized from several aspects, including phenomics and taxonomics, genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics. We proposed a multi-omics data-based workflow for medicinal plant research. It was emphasized that integration of the omics data was important for plant authentication and mechanistic studies on plant metabolism. Additionally, the computational tools for proper storage, efficient processing and high-throughput analyses of the omics data have been introduced into the workflow. According to the workflow, authentication of the medicinal plant materials should not only be performed at the phenomics level but also be implemented by genomic and metabolomic marker-based examination. On the other hand, functional genomics studies, transcriptional regulatory networks and protein-protein interactions will contribute greatly for deciphering the secondary metabolic pathways. Finally, we hope that our work could inspire further efforts on the bioinformatics-assisted, integrated omics studies on the medicinal plants.
37679543	2024	Nature biotechnology	Multi-omics data integration using ratio-based quantitative profiling with Quartet reference materials.	Characterization and integration of the genome, epigenome, transcriptome, proteome and metabolome of different datasets is difficult owing to a lack of ground truth. Here we develop and characterize suites of publicly available multi-omics reference materials of matched DNA, RNA, protein and metabolites derived from immortalized cell lines from a family quartet of parents and monozygotic twin daughters. These references provide built-in truth defined by relationships among the family members and the information flow from DNA to RNA to protein. We demonstrate how using a ratio-based profiling approach that scales the absolute feature values of a study sample relative to those of a concurrently measured common reference sample produces reproducible and comparable data suitable for integration across batches, labs, platforms and omics types. Our study identifies reference-free 'absolute' feature quantification as the root cause of irreproducibility in multi-omics measurement and data integration and establishes the advantages of ratio-based multi-omics profiling with common reference materials.
36593403	2023	Nature biotechnology	scChIX-seq infers dynamic relationships between histone modifications in single cells.	Regulation of chromatin states involves the dynamic interplay between different histone modifications to control gene expression. Recent advances have enabled mapping of histone marks in single cells, but most methods are constrained to profile only one histone mark per cell. Here, we present an integrated experimental and computational framework, scChIX-seq (single-cell chromatin immunocleavage and unmixing sequencing), to map several histone marks in single cells. scChIX-seq multiplexes two histone marks together in single cells, then computationally deconvolves the signal using training data from respective histone mark profiles. This framework learns the cell-type-specific correlation structure between histone marks, and therefore does not require a priori assumptions of their genomic distributions. Using scChIX-seq, we demonstrate multimodal analysis of histone marks in single cells across a range of mark combinations. Modeling dynamics of in vitro macrophage differentiation enables integrated analysis of chromatin velocity. Overall, scChIX-seq unlocks systematic interrogation of the interplay between histone modifications in single cells.
38098055	2023	Genome biology	Challenges and opportunities to computationally deconvolve heterogeneous tissue with varying cell sizes using single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets.	"Deconvolution of cell mixtures in ""bulk"" transcriptomic samples from homogenate human tissue is important for understanding disease pathologies. However, several experimental and computational challenges impede transcriptomics-based deconvolution approaches using single-cell/nucleus RNA-seq reference atlases. Cells from the brain and blood have substantially different sizes, total mRNA, and transcriptional activities, and existing approaches may quantify total mRNA instead of cell type proportions. Further, standards are lacking for the use of cell reference atlases and integrative analyses of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data. We discuss how to approach these key challenges with orthogonal ""gold standard"" datasets for evaluating deconvolution methods."
39377391	2025	Nucleic acids research	AMIR: a multi-omics data platform for Asteraceae plants genetics and breeding research.	As the largest family of dicotyledon, the Asteraceae family comprises a variety of economically important crops, ornamental plants and numerous medicinal herbs. Advancements in genomics and transcriptomic have revolutionized research in Asteraceae species, generating extensive omics data that necessitate an efficient platform for data integration and analysis. However, existing databases face challenges in mining genes with specific functions and supporting cross-species studies. To address these gaps, we introduce the Asteraceae Multi-omics Information Resource (AMIR; https://yanglab.hzau.edu.cn/AMIR/), a multi-omics hub for the Asteraceae plant community. AMIR integrates diverse omics data from 74 species, encompassing 132 genomes, 4 408 432 genes annotated across seven different perspectives, 3897 transcriptome sequencing samples spanning 131 organs, tissues and stimuli, 42 765 290 unique variants and 15 662 metabolites genes. Leveraging these data, AMIR establishes the first pan-genome, comparative genomics and transcriptome system for the Asteraceae family. Furthermore, AMIR offers user-friendly tools designed to facilitate extensive customized bioinformatics analyses. Two case studies demonstrate AMIR's capability to provide rapid, reproducible and reliable analysis results. In summary, by integrating multi-omics data of Asteraceae species and developing powerful analytical tools, AMIR significantly advances functional genomics research and contributes to breeding practices of Asteraceae.
41123022	2025	Nucleic acids research	Spatial2GWAS: a database for linking spatial transcriptomic regions with GWAS traits.	Spatial heterogeneity of gene expression within tissue regions has a critical influence on biological functions, thereby affecting disease pathogenesis. However, systematic associations between spatially resolved transcriptomes and phenotypes, especially in complex diseases, remain underexplored. Here, we developed spatial2GWAS (http://www.spatial2gwas.cn), a comprehensive resource linking spatial transcriptomic (ST) regions with GWAS traits. In the database, we collected 1196 ST slices (human and mouse) from five technologies and 812 GWAS traits spanning 18 phenotype categories and identified 29 701 ST slice-GWAS trait pairs containing 47 492 significant regions. Functional analyses reveal distinct patterns of cell type composition, gene expression, GO/KEGG pathway activation, and cell-cell communication direction between trait-related and unrelated spatial regions. The database provides a user-friendly interface for visualization of spatial regions and GWAS trait associations, supporting advanced queries by slice and GWAS information, genes co-expressed with GWAS trait-associated genes, and spatial regions. Spatial2GWAS aims to enable systematic exploration of spatial mechanisms underlying complex traits and offer insights into region-specific biological functions and potential therapeutic targets. This database bridges ST and high-level phenotypes, advancing the understanding of tissue heterogeneity in complex human diseases.
36329320	2023	Nature biotechnology	Spatial mapping of the total transcriptome by in situ polyadenylation.	Spatial transcriptomics reveals the spatial context of gene expression, but current methods are limited to assaying polyadenylated (A-tailed) RNA transcripts. Here we demonstrate that enzymatic in situ polyadenylation of RNA enables detection of the full spectrum of RNAs, expanding the scope of sequencing-based spatial transcriptomics to the total transcriptome. We demonstrate that our spatial total RNA-sequencing (STRS) approach captures coding RNAs, noncoding RNAs and viral RNAs. We apply STRS to study skeletal muscle regeneration and viral-induced myocarditis. Our analyses reveal the spatial patterns of noncoding RNA expression with near-cellular resolution, identify spatially defined expression of noncoding transcripts in skeletal muscle regeneration and highlight host transcriptional responses associated with local viral RNA abundance. STRS requires adding only one step to the widely used Visium spatial total RNA-sequencing protocol from 10x Genomics, and thus could be easily adopted to enable new insights into spatial gene regulation and biology.
39780487	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Deciphering progressive lesion areas in breast cancer spatial transcriptomics via TGR-NMF.	Identifying spatial domains is critical for understanding breast cancer tissue heterogeneity and providing insights into tumor progression. However, dropout events introduces computational challenges and the lack of transparency in methods such as graph neural networks limits their interpretability. This study aimed to decipher disease progression-related spatial domains in breast cancer spatial transcriptomics by developing the three graph regularized non-negative matrix factorization (TGR-NMF). A unitization strategy was proposed to mitigate the impact of dropout events on the computational process, enabling utilization of the complete gene expression count data. By integrating one gene expression neighbor topology and two spatial position neighbor topologies, TGR-NMF was developed for constructing an interpretable low-dimensional representation of spatial transcriptomic data. The progressive lesion area that can reveal the progression of breast cancer was uncovered through heterogeneity analysis. Moreover, several related pathogenic genes and signal pathways on this area were identified by using gene enrichment and cell communication analysis.
29547932	2018	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Network-based integration of multi-omics data for prioritizing cancer genes.	MOTIVATION: Several molecular events are known to be cancer-related, including genomic aberrations, hypermethylation of gene promoter regions and differential expression of microRNAs. These aberration events are very heterogeneous across tumors and it is poorly understood how they affect the molecular makeup of the cell, including the transcriptome and proteome. Protein interaction networks can help decode the functional relationship between aberration events and changes in gene and protein expression. RESULTS: We developed NetICS (Network-based Integration of Multi-omics Data), a new graph diffusion-based method for prioritizing cancer genes by integrating diverse molecular data types on a directed functional interaction network. NetICS prioritizes genes by their mediator effect, defined as the proximity of the gene to upstream aberration events and to downstream differentially expressed genes and proteins in an interaction network. Genes are prioritized for individual samples separately and integrated using a robust rank aggregation technique. NetICS provides a comprehensive computational framework that can aid in explaining the heterogeneity of aberration events by their functional convergence to common differentially expressed genes and proteins. We demonstrate NetICS' competitive performance in predicting known cancer genes and in generating robust gene lists using TCGA data from five cancer types. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: NetICS is available at https://github.com/cbg-ethz/netics. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
39581871	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	TriTan: an efficient triple nonnegative matrix factorization method for integrative analysis of single-cell multiomics data.	Single-cell multiomics have opened up tremendous opportunities for understanding gene regulatory networks underlying cell states by simultaneously profiling transcriptomes, epigenomes, and proteomes of the same cell. However, existing computational methods for integrative analysis of these high-dimensional multiomics data are either computationally expensive or limited in interpretation. These limitations pose challenges in the implementation of these methods in large-scale studies and hinder a more in-depth understanding of the underlying regulatory mechanisms. Here, we propose TriTan (Triple inTegrative fast non-negative matrix factorization), an efficient joint factorization method for single-cell multiomics data. TriTan implements a highly efficient factorization algorithm, greatly improving its computational performance. Three matrix factorization produced by TriTan helps in clustering cells, identifying signature features for each cell type, and uncovering feature associations across omics, which facilitates the identification of domains of regulatory chromatin and the prediction of cell-type-specific regulatory networks. We applied TriTan to the single-cell multiomics data obtained from different technologies and benchmarked it against the state-of-the-art methods where it shows highly competitive performance. Furthermore, we showed a range of downstream analyses conducted utilizing TriTan outputs, highlighting its capacity to facilitate interpretation in biological discovery.
38940132	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	SPRITE: improving spatial gene expression imputation with gene and cell networks.	MOTIVATION: Spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomics have provided unprecedented insights into gene expression in situ, particularly in the context of cell interactions or organization of tissues. However, current technologies for profiling spatial gene expression at single-cell resolution are generally limited to the measurement of a small number of genes. To address this limitation, several algorithms have been developed to impute or predict the expression of additional genes that were not present in the measured gene panel. Current algorithms do not leverage the rich spatial and gene relational information in spatial transcriptomics. To improve spatial gene expression predictions, we introduce Spatial Propagation and Reinforcement of Imputed Transcript Expression (SPRITE) as a meta-algorithm that processes predictions obtained from existing methods by propagating information across gene correlation networks and spatial neighborhood graphs. RESULTS: SPRITE improves spatial gene expression predictions across multiple spatial transcriptomics datasets. Furthermore, SPRITE predicted spatial gene expression leads to improved clustering, visualization, and classification of cells. SPRITE can be used in spatial transcriptomics data analysis to improve inferences based on predicted gene expression. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The SPRITE software package is available at https://github.com/sunericd/SPRITE. Code for generating experiments and analyses in the manuscript is available at https://github.com/sunericd/sprite-figures-and-analyses.
40258090	2025	PLoS computational biology	Transfer learning of multicellular organization via single-cell and spatial transcriptomics.	Biological tissues exhibit complex gene expression and multicellular patterns that are valuable to dissect. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides full coverages of genes, but lacks spatial information, whereas spatial transcriptomics (ST) measures spatial locations of individual or group of cells, with more restrictions on gene information. Here we show a transfer learning method named iSORT to decipher spatial organization of cells by integrating scRNA-seq and ST data. iSORT trains a neural network that maps gene expressions to spatial locations. iSORT can find spatial patterns at single-cell scale, identify spatial-organizing genes (SOGs) that drive the patterning, and infer pseudo-growth trajectories using a concept of SpaRNA velocity. Benchmarking on a range of biological systems, such as human cortex, mouse embryo, mouse brain, Drosophila embryo, and human developmental heart, demonstrates iSORT's accuracy and practicality in reconstructing multicellular organization. We further conducted scRNA-seq and ST sequencing from normal and atherosclerotic arteries, and the functional enrichment analysis shows that SOGs found by iSORT are strongly associated with vascular structural anomalies.
35924984	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	ASURAT: functional annotation-driven unsupervised clustering of single-cell transcriptomes.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis reveals heterogeneity and dynamic cell transitions. However, conventional gene-based analyses require intensive manual curation to interpret biological implications of computational results. Hence, a theory for efficiently annotating individual cells remains warranted. RESULTS: We present ASURAT, a computational tool for simultaneously performing unsupervised clustering and functional annotation of disease, cell type, biological process and signaling pathway activity for single-cell transcriptomic data, using a correlation graph decomposition for genes in database-derived functional terms. We validated the usability and clustering performance of ASURAT using scRNA-seq datasets for human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which required fewer manual curations than existing methods. Moreover, we applied ASURAT to scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptome datasets for human small cell lung cancer and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, respectively, identifying previously overlooked subpopulations and differentially expressed genes. ASURAT is a powerful tool for dissecting cell subpopulations and improving biological interpretability of complex and noisy transcriptomic data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: ASURAT is published on Bioconductor (https://doi.org/10.18129/B9.bioc.ASURAT). The codes for analyzing data in this article are available at Github (https://github.com/keita-iida/ASURATBI) and figshare (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.19200254.v4).

34301623	2021	Genome research	A graph neural network model to estimate cell-wise metabolic flux using single-cell RNA-seq data.	The metabolic heterogeneity and metabolic interplay between cells are known as significant contributors to disease treatment resistance. However, with the lack of a mature high-throughput single-cell metabolomics technology, we are yet to establish systematic understanding of the intra-tissue metabolic heterogeneity and cooperative mechanisms. To mitigate this knowledge gap, we developed a novel computational method, namely, single-cell flux estimation analysis (scFEA), to infer the cell-wise fluxome from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. scFEA is empowered by a systematically reconstructed human metabolic map as a factor graph, a novel probabilistic model to leverage the flux balance constraints on scRNA-seq data, and a novel graph neural network-based optimization solver. The intricate information cascade from transcriptome to metabolome was captured using multilayer neural networks to capitulate the nonlinear dependency between enzymatic gene expressions and reaction rates. We experimentally validated scFEA by generating an scRNA-seq data set with matched metabolomics data on cells of perturbed oxygen and genetic conditions. Application of scFEA on this data set showed the consistency between predicted flux and the observed variation of metabolite abundance in the matched metabolomics data. We also applied scFEA on five publicly available scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data sets and identified context- and cell group-specific metabolic variations. The cell-wise fluxome predicted by scFEA empowers a series of downstream analyses including identification of metabolic modules or cell groups that share common metabolic variations, sensitivity evaluation of enzymes with regards to their impact on the whole metabolic flux, and inference of cell-tissue and cell-cell metabolic communications.
35346318	2022	Genome biology	Multi-omics analysis dissects the genetic architecture of seed coat content in Brassica napus.	BACKGROUND: Brassica napus is an important vegetable oil source worldwide. Seed coat content is a complex quantitative trait that negatively correlates with the seed oil content in B. napus. RESULTS: Here we provide insights into the genetic basis of natural variation of seed coat content by transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using 382 B. napus accessions. By population transcriptomic analysis, we identify more than 700 genes and four gene modules that are significantly associated with seed coat content. We also characterize three reliable quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling seed coat content by GWAS. Combining TWAS and correlation networks of seed coat content-related gene modules, we find that BnaC07.CCR-LIKE (CCRL) and BnaTT8s play key roles in the determination of the trait by modulating lignin biosynthesis. By expression GWAS analysis, we identify a regulatory hotspot on chromosome A09, which is involved in controlling seed coat content through BnaC07.CCRL and BnaTT8s. We then predict the downstream genes regulated by BnaTT8s using multi-omics datasets. We further experimentally validate that BnaCCRL and BnaTT8 positively regulate seed coat content and lignin content. BnaCCRL represents a novel identified gene involved in seed coat development. Furthermore, we also predict the key genes regulating carbon allocation between phenylpropane compounds and oil during seed development in B. napus. CONCLUSIONS: This study helps us to better understand the complex machinery of seed coat development and provides a genetic resource for genetic improvement of seed coat content in B. napus breeding.
37779245	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	ScSmOP: a universal computational pipeline for single-cell single-molecule multiomics data analysis.	Single-cell multiomics techniques have been widely applied to detect the key signature of cells. These methods have achieved a single-molecule resolution and can even reveal spatial localization. These emerging methods provide insights elucidating the features of genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic heterogeneity in individual cells. However, they have given rise to new computational challenges in data processing. Here, we describe Single-cell Single-molecule multiple Omics Pipeline (ScSmOP), a universal pipeline for barcode-indexed single-cell single-molecule multiomics data analysis. Essentially, the C language is utilized in ScSmOP to set up spaced-seed hash table-based algorithms for barcode identification according to ligation-based barcoding data and synthesis-based barcoding data, followed by data mapping and deconvolution. We demonstrate high reproducibility of data processing between ScSmOP and published pipelines in comprehensive analyses of single-cell omics data (scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, scARC-seq), single-molecule chromatin interaction data (ChIA-Drop, SPRITE, RD-SPRITE), single-cell single-molecule chromatin interaction data (scSPRITE) and spatial transcriptomic data from various cell types and species. Additionally, ScSmOP shows more rapid performance and is a versatile, efficient, easy-to-use and robust pipeline for single-cell single-molecule multiomics data analysis.
41067887	2025	Genome research	Recovering gene regulatory networks in single-cell multiomics data with PRISM-GRN.	Understanding Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) is crucial for deciphering cellular heterogeneity and the mechanisms underlying development and disease. However, current GRN inference methods fail to utilize multiomics data and prior knowledge from a biologically-interpretable insight. Therefore, we propose PRISM-GRN, a Bayesian model that seamlessly incorporates known GRNs, along with scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data, into a probabilistic framework to reconstruct cell type-specific GRNs. PRISM-GRN employs a biologically interpretable architecture firmly rooted in the established gene regulatory mechanism, which asserts that gene expression is influenced by TF expression levels and gene chromatin accessibility through GRNs. Accordingly, PRISM-GRN decomposes observable data into biologically meaningful latent variables through a mechanism-informed generation process and a prior-GRN-primed inference process, enabling precise and robust GRN reconstruction. We evaluate PRISM-GRN on four benchmarking datasets with paired scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data, demonstrating its superior performance over seven baseline methods in GRN reconstruction, especially its higher precision under the inherently imbalanced scenario where the true regulatory interaction is sparse. Furthermore, benchmarking on directed GRNs highlights PRISM-GRN's ability to capture causality in gene regulation derived from the biologically-interpretable architecture. More importantly, PRISM-GRN performs well with unpaired omics data and limited prior GRN information, showcasing its flexibility and adaptability across various biological contexts. Finally, biological analyses on PBMC datasets demonstrate PRISM-GRN's potential to facilitate the identification of cell type-specific or context-specific GRNs across broader real-world biological research applications. Overall, PRISM-GRN provides a novel paradigm for precise, robust, and interpretable exploration of causal GRNs with prior knowledge and multiomics data.
40392208	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	OrthologAL: a Shiny application for quality-aware humanization of non-human pre-clinical high-dimensional gene expression data.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell and spatial transcriptomics provide unprecedented insight into diseases. Pharmacotranscriptomic approaches are powerful tools that leverage gene expression data for drug repurposing and discovery. Multiple databases attempt to connect human cellular transcriptional responses to small molecules for use in transcriptome-based drug discovery efforts. However, preclinical research often requires in vivo experiments in non-human species, which makes utilizing such valuable resources difficult. To facilitate both human orthologous conversion of non-human transcriptomes and the application of pharmacotranscriptomic databases to pre-clinical research models, we introduce OrthologAL. OrthologAL interfaces with BioMart to access different gene sets from the Ensembl database, allowing for ortholog conversion without the need for user-generated code. RESULTS: Researchers can input their single-cell or other high-dimensional gene expression data from any species as a Seurat object, and OrthologAL will output a human ortholog-converted Seurat object for download and use. To demonstrate the utility of this application, we tested OrthologAL using single-cell, single-nuclei, and spatial transcriptomic data derived from common preclinical models, including patient-derived orthotopic xenografts of medulloblastoma, and mouse and rat models of spinal cord injury. OrthologAL can convert these data types efficiently to that of corresponding orthologs while preserving the dimensional architecture of the original non-human expression data.

31913438	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	BEM: Mining Coregulation Patterns in Transcriptomics via Boolean Matrix Factorization.	MOTIVATION: The matrix factorization is an important way to analyze coregulation patterns in transcriptomic data, which can reveal the tumor signal perturbation status and subtype classification. However, current matrix factorization methods do not provide clear bicluster structure. Furthermore, these algorithms are based on the assumption of linear combination, which may not be sufficient to capture the coregulation patterns. RESULTS: We presented a new algorithm for Boolean matrix factorization (BMF) via expectation maximization (BEM). BEM is more aligned with the molecular mechanism of transcriptomic coregulation and can scale to matrix with over 100 million data points. Synthetic experiments showed that BEM outperformed other BMF methods in terms of reconstruction error. Real-world application demonstrated that BEM is applicable to all kinds of transcriptomic data, including bulk RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomic datasets. Given appropriate binarization, BEM was able to extract coregulation patterns consistent with disease subtypes, cell types or spatial anatomy. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Python source code of BEM is available on https://github.com/LifanLiang/EM_BMF. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
38940134	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	A count-based model for delineating cell-cell interactions in spatial transcriptomics data.	MOTIVATION: Cell-cell interactions (CCIs) consist of cells exchanging signals with themselves and neighboring cells by expressing ligand and receptor molecules and play a key role in cellular development, tissue homeostasis, and other critical biological functions. Since direct measurement of CCIs is challenging, multiple methods have been developed to infer CCIs by quantifying correlations between the gene expression of the ligands and receptors that mediate CCIs, originally from bulk RNA-sequencing data and more recently from single-cell or spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) data. SRT has a particular advantage over single-cell approaches, since ligand-receptor correlations can be computed between cells or spots that are physically close in the tissue. However, the transcript counts of individual ligands and receptors in SRT data are generally low, complicating the inference of CCIs from expression correlations. RESULTS: We introduce Copulacci, a count-based model for inferring CCIs from SRT data. Copulacci uses a Gaussian copula to model dependencies between the expression of ligands and receptors from nearby spatial locations even when the transcript counts are low. On simulated data, Copulacci outperforms existing CCI inference methods based on the standard Spearman and Pearson correlation coefficients. Using several real SRT datasets, we show that Copulacci discovers biologically meaningful ligand-receptor interactions that are lowly expressed and undiscoverable by existing CCI inference methods. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Copulacci is implemented in Python and available at https://github.com/raphael-group/copulacci.
37858204	2023	Genome biology	GeneSegNet: a deep learning framework for cell segmentation by integrating gene expression and imaging.	When analyzing data from in situ RNA detection technologies, cell segmentation is an essential step in identifying cell boundaries, assigning RNA reads to cells, and studying the gene expression and morphological features of cells. We developed a deep-learning-based method, GeneSegNet, that integrates both gene expression and imaging information to perform cell segmentation. GeneSegNet also employs a recursive training strategy to deal with noisy training labels. We show that GeneSegNet significantly improves cell segmentation performances over existing methods that either ignore gene expression information or underutilize imaging information.
39293805	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Multi-omics integration for both single-cell and spatially resolved data based on dual-path graph attention auto-encoder.	Single-cell multi-omics integration enables joint analysis at the single-cell level of resolution to provide more accurate understanding of complex biological systems, while spatial multi-omics integration is benefit to the exploration of cell spatial heterogeneity to facilitate more comprehensive downstream analyses. Existing methods are mainly designed for single-cell multi-omics data with little consideration of spatial information and still have room for performance improvement. A reliable multi-omics integration method designed for both single-cell and spatially resolved data is necessary and significant. We propose a multi-omics integration method based on dual-path graph attention auto-encoder (SSGATE). It can construct the neighborhood graphs based on single-cell expression profiles or spatial coordinates, enabling it to process single-cell data and utilize spatial information from spatially resolved data. It can also perform self-supervised learning for integration through the graph attention auto-encoders from two paths. SSGATE is applied to integration of transcriptomics and proteomics, including single-cell and spatially resolved data of various tissues from different sequencing technologies. SSGATE shows better performance and stronger robustness than competitive methods and facilitates downstream analysis.
37544658	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Identifying spatial domains of spatially resolved transcriptomics via multi-view graph convolutional networks.	MOTIVATION: Recent advances in spatially resolved transcriptomics (ST) technologies enable the measurement of gene expression profiles while preserving cellular spatial context. Linking gene expression of cells with their spatial distribution is essential for better understanding of tissue microenvironment and biological progress. However, effectively combining gene expression data with spatial information to identify spatial domains remains challenging. RESULTS: To deal with the above issue, in this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised learning framework named STMGCN for identifying spatial domains using multi-view graph convolution networks (MGCNs). Specifically, to fully exploit spatial information, we first construct multiple neighbor graphs (views) with different similarity measures based on the spatial coordinates. Then, STMGCN learns multiple view-specific embeddings by combining gene expressions with each neighbor graph through graph convolution networks. Finally, to capture the importance of different graphs, we further introduce an attention mechanism to adaptively fuse view-specific embeddings and thus derive the final spot embedding. STMGCN allows for the effective utilization of spatial context to enhance the expressive power of the latent embeddings with multiple graph convolutions. We apply STMGCN on two simulation datasets and five real spatial transcriptomics datasets with different resolutions across distinct platforms. The experimental results demonstrate that STMGCN obtains competitive results in spatial domain identification compared with five state-of-the-art methods, including spatial and non-spatial alternatives. Besides, STMGCN can detect spatially variable genes with enriched expression patterns in the identified domains. Overall, STMGCN is a powerful and efficient computational framework for identifying spatial domains in spatial transcriptomics data.

41171126	2025	Nucleic acids research	DOO: integrated multi-omics resources for deep ocean organisms.	The deep ocean is one of Earth's most vast and least explored frontiers, characterized by extreme conditions such as high pressure, limited light, and nutrient scarcity. These environments pose unparalleled challenges to life, making them invaluable for studying genetic and molecular adaptations to extreme conditions. Emerging omics resources have recently provided significant insights into the advanced understanding of deep ocean ecosystems and evolution. However, a centralized resource for deep ocean multi-omics data remains lacking. To bridge this gap, the Deep Ocean Omics (DOO, https://DeepOceanOmics.org) database, a multi-omics atlas for deep ocean organisms, is presented. DOO integrates diverse omics resources from 68 species across seven phyla and 16 classes, encompassing 72 genomes, 950 bulk transcriptomes, 15 single-cell transcriptomes, and 1112 metagenomes, alongside functional support toolkits for functional and comparative analysis. DOO provides a systematic view of genomic information, including genome assembly, phylogeny, gene annotation, BUSCO genes, transcription factors/ubiquitin family, gene clusters, symbiont and mitochondrial genomes, and fossil records. Moreover, DOO offers co-expression networks with expression views across different tissues, and developmental stages and micro- and macrosynteny analyses to elucidate the pan-evolutionary features of genome structure. ​As the first comprehensive multi-omics resource dedicated to deep ocean organisms, DOO serves as a pivotal platform for uncovering multi-omics underpinnings of deep ocean organisms and offering insights into the understanding of deep ocean biodiversity, evolution, and genetic adaptation under extreme conditions.
36797409	2023	Nature methods	SODB facilitates comprehensive exploration of spatial omics data.	Spatial omics technologies generate wealthy but highly complex datasets.

36189903	2023	Nucleic acids research	EmAtlas: a comprehensive atlas for exploring spatiotemporal activation in mammalian embryogenesis.	The emerging importance of embryonic development research rapidly increases the volume for a professional resource related to multi-omics data. However, the lack of global embryogenesis repository and systematic analysis tools limits the preceding in stem cell research, human congenital diseases and assisted reproduction. Here, we developed the EmAtlas, which collects the most comprehensive multi-omics data and provides multi-scale tools to explore spatiotemporal activation during mammalian embryogenesis. EmAtlas contains data on multiple types of gene expression, chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation, nucleosome occupancy, histone modifications, and transcription factors, which displays the complete spatiotemporal landscape in mouse and human across several time points, involving gametogenesis, preimplantation, even fetus and neonate, and each tissue involves various cell types. To characterize signatures involved in the tissue, cell, genome, gene and protein levels during mammalian embryogenesis, analysis tools on these five scales were developed. Additionally, we proposed EmRanger to deliver extensive development-related biological background annotations. Users can utilize these tools to analyze, browse, visualize, and download data owing to the user-friendly interface. EmAtlas is freely accessible at http://bioinfor.imu.edu.cn/ematlas.
40272889	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	m2ST: dual multi-scale graph clustering for spatially resolved transcriptomics.	MOTIVATION: Spatial clustering is a key analytical technique for exploring spatial transcriptomics data. Recent graph neural network-based methods have shown promise in spatial clustering but face notable challenges. One significant issue is that analyzing the functions and complex mechanisms of organisms from a single scale is difficult and most methods focus exclusively on the single-scale representation of transcriptomic data, potentially limiting the discriminative power of extracted features for spatial domain clustering. Furthermore, classical clustering algorithms are often applied directly to latent representation, making it a worthwhile endeavor to explore a tailored clustering method to further improve the accuracy of spatial domain annotation. RESULTS: To address these limitations, we propose m2ST, a novel dual multi-scale graph clustering method. m2ST first uses a multi-scale masked graph autoencoder to extract representations across different scales from spatial transcriptomic data. To effectively compress and distill meaningful knowledge embedded in the data, m2ST introduces a random masking mechanism for node features and uses a scaled cosine error as the loss function. Additionally, we introduce a tailored multi-scale clustering framework that integrates scale-common and scale-specific information exploration into the clustering process, achieving more robust annotation performance. Shannon entropy is finally utilized to dynamically adjust the importance of different scales. Extensive experiments on multiple spatial transcriptomic datasets demonstrate the superior performance of m2ST compared to existing methods. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: https://github.com/BBKing49/m2ST.
35849101	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	Spatial transcriptomics prediction from histology jointly through Transformer and graph neural networks.	The rapid development of spatial transcriptomics allows the measurement of RNA abundance at a high spatial resolution, making it possible to simultaneously profile gene expression, spatial locations of cells or spots, and the corresponding hematoxylin and eosin-stained histology images. It turns promising to predict gene expression from histology images that are relatively easy and cheap to obtain. For this purpose, several methods are devised, but they have not fully captured the internal relations of the 2D vision features or spatial dependency between spots. Here, we developed Hist2ST, a deep learning-based model to predict RNA-seq expression from histology images. Around each sequenced spot, the corresponding histology image is cropped into an image patch and fed into a convolutional module to extract 2D vision features. Meanwhile, the spatial relations with the whole image and neighbored patches are captured through Transformer and graph neural network modules, respectively. These learned features are then used to predict the gene expression by following the zero-inflated negative binomial distribution. To alleviate the impact by the small spatial transcriptomics data, a self-distillation mechanism is employed for efficient learning of the model. By comprehensive tests on cancer and normal datasets, Hist2ST was shown to outperform existing methods in terms of both gene expression prediction and spatial region identification. Further pathway analyses indicated that our model could reserve biological information. Thus, Hist2ST enables generating spatial transcriptomics data from histology images for elucidating molecular signatures of tissues.
39921890	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	NMFProfiler: a multi-omics integration method for samples stratified in groups.

In the first case, it successfully identified signatures combining known AD protein biomarkers and novel transcriptomic biomarkers. In addition, it was also able to extract signatures significantly associated to cancer survival. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: NMFProfiler is released as a Python package, NMFProfiler (v0.3.0), available on PyPI."
41233159	2025	Genome research	Unified integration of spatial transcriptomics across platforms with LLOKI.	Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has transformed our understanding of tissue architecture and cellular interactions, but integrating ST data across platforms remains challenging due to differences in gene panels, data sparsity, and technical variability. Here, we introduce LLOKI, a novel framework for integrating imaging-based ST data from diverse platforms without requiring shared gene panels. LLOKI addresses ST integration through two key alignment tasks: feature alignment across technologies and batch alignment across data sets. Optimal transport-guided feature propagation adjusts data sparsity to match scRNA-seq references through graph-based imputation, enabling single-cell foundation models such as scGPT to generate unified features. Batch alignment then refines scGPT-transformed embeddings, mitigating batch effects while preserving biological variability. Evaluations on mouse brain samples from five different technologies demonstrate that LLOKI outperforms existing methods and is effective for cross-technology spatial gene program identification, and tissue slice alignment. Applying LLOKI to five ovarian cancer data sets, we identify an integrated gene program indicative of tumor-infiltrating T cells across gene panels. Together, LLOKI provides a robust foundation for cross-platform ST studies, with the potential to scale to large atlas data sets, enabling deeper insights into cellular organization and tissue environments.
32383753	2020	Nucleic acids research	dotdotdot: an automated approach to quantify multiplex single molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH) images in complex tissues.	Multiplex single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH) is a powerful method for validating RNA sequencing and emerging spatial transcriptomic data, but quantification remains a computational challenge. We present a framework for generating and analyzing smFISH data in complex tissues while overcoming autofluorescence and increasing multiplexing capacity. We developed dotdotdot (https://github.com/LieberInstitute/dotdotdot) as a corresponding software package to quantify RNA transcripts in single nuclei and perform differential expression analysis. We first demonstrate robustness of our platform in single mouse neurons by quantifying differential expression of activity-regulated genes. We then quantify spatial gene expression in human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) using spectral imaging and dotdotdot to mask lipofuscin autofluorescence. We lastly apply machine learning to predict cell types and perform downstream cell type-specific expression analysis. In summary, we provide experimental workflows, imaging acquisition and analytic strategies for quantification and biological interpretation of smFISH data in complex tissues.
36243967	2023	Nucleic acids research	Aquila: a spatial omics database and analysis platform.

Finally, Aquila can be installed as an individual app on a desktop and offers the RESTful API service for power users to access the database. Overall, Aquila provides a detailed insight into transcript and protein expression in tissues from a spatial perspective. Aquila is available at https://aquila.cheunglab.org.
37139553	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	InferLoop: leveraging single-cell chromatin accessibility for the signal of chromatin loop.	Deciphering cell-type-specific 3D structures of chromatin is challenging. Here, we present InferLoop, a novel method for inferring the strength of chromatin interaction using single-cell chromatin accessibility data. The workflow of InferLoop is, first, to conduct signal enhancement by grouping nearby cells into bins, and then, for each bin, leverage accessibility signals for loop signals using a newly constructed metric that is similar to the perturbation of the Pearson correlation coefficient. In this study, we have described three application scenarios of InferLoop, including the inference of cell-type-specific loop signals, the prediction of gene expression levels and the interpretation of intergenic loci. The effectiveness and superiority of InferLoop over other methods in those three scenarios are rigorously validated by using the single-cell 3D genome structure data of human brain cortex and human blood, the single-cell multi-omics data of human blood and mouse brain cortex, and the intergenic loci in the GWAS Catalog database as well as the GTEx database, respectively. In addition, InferLoop can be applied to predict loop signals of individual spots using the spatial chromatin accessibility data of mouse embryo. InferLoop is available at https://github.com/jumphone/inferloop.
41263103	2025	Nucleic acids research	InsectBase 3.0: a comprehensive multi-omics resource for insects.	Insects represent the most diverse animal group and play essential roles in ecosystems, agriculture, and human health. The rapid accumulation of high-quality genomes and diverse omics datasets provides unprecedented opportunities to advance research in insect biology and evolution, yet also poses challenges in data integration, accessibility, and reuse. To address these demands, we developed InsectBase 3.0 (www.insect-genome.com), an upgraded platform that integrates extensive insect multi-omics data and provides user-friendly tools for furthor analysis.

To organize these heterogeneous resources, InsectBase 3.0 introduces knowledge graphs centered on species and genes, enabling users to navigate cross-dataset relationships more intuitively. In addition, the web framework has been modernized to improve efficiency, interactivity, and visualization. Together, these updates establish InsectBase 3.0 as the most comprehensive open-access insect omics platform to date, providing a valuable resource for evolutionary, functional, and applied research in insects.
40796171	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Mitigation of multi-scale biases in cell-type deconvolution for spatially resolved transcriptomics using HarmoDecon.	MOTIVATION: The advent of spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) has revolutionized our understanding of tissue molecular microenvironments by enabling the study of gene expression in its spatial context. However, many SRT platforms lack single-cell resolution, necessitating cell-type deconvolution methods to estimate cell-type proportions in SRT spots. Despite advancements in existing tools, these methods have not addressed biases occurring at three scales: individual spots, entire tissue samples, and discrepancies between SRT and reference scRNA-seq datasets. These biases result in overbalanced cell-type proportions for each spot, mismatched cell-type fractions at the sample level, and data distribution shifts across platforms. RESULTS: To mitigate these biases, we introduce HarmoDecon, a novel semi-supervised deep learning model for spatial cell-type deconvolution. HarmoDecon leverages pseudo-spots derived from scRNA-seq data and uses Gaussian Mixture Graph Convolutional Networks to address the aforementioned issues. Through extensive simulations on multi-cell spots from STARmap and osmFISH, HarmoDecon outperformed 11 state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, when applied to legacy SRT platforms and 10x Visium datasets, HarmoDecon achieved the highest accuracy in spatial domain clustering and maintained strong correlations between cancer marker genes and cancer cells in human breast cancer samples. These results highlight the utility of HarmoDecon in advancing spatial transcriptomics analysis. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The HarmoDecon scripts, with the detailed tutorials, are available at https://github.com/ericcombiolab/HarmoDecon/tree/main.
40037644	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Benchmarking copy number aberrations inference tools using single-cell multi-omics datasets.	Copy number alterations (CNAs) are an important type of genomic variation which play a crucial role in the initiation and progression of cancer. With the explosion of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), several computational methods have been developed to infer CNAs from scRNA-seq studies. However, to date, no independent studies have comprehensively benchmarked their performance. Herein, we evaluated five state-of-the-art methods based on their performance in tumor versus normal cell classification; CNAs profile accuracy, tumor subclone inference, and aneuploidy identification in non-malignant cells. Our results showed that Numbat outperformed others across most evaluation criteria, while CopyKAT excelled in scenarios when expression matrix alone was used as input. In specific tasks, SCEVAN showed the best performance in clonal breakpoint detection and Numbat showed high sensitivity in copy number neutral LOH (cnLOH) detection. Additionally, we investigated how referencing settings, inclusion of tumor microenvironment cells, tumor type, and tumor purity impact the performance of these tools. This study provides a valuable guideline for researchers in selecting the appropriate methods for their datasets.
28640810	2017	PLoS computational biology	LASSIM-A network inference toolbox for genome-wide mechanistic modeling.	Recent technological advancements have made time-resolved, quantitative, multi-omics data available for many model systems, which could be integrated for systems pharmacokinetic use. Here, we present large-scale simulation modeling (LASSIM), which is a novel mathematical tool for performing large-scale inference using mechanistically defined ordinary differential equations (ODE) for gene regulatory networks (GRNs). LASSIM integrates structural knowledge about regulatory interactions and non-linear equations with multiple steady state and dynamic response expression datasets. The rationale behind LASSIM is that biological GRNs can be simplified using a limited subset of core genes that are assumed to regulate all other gene transcription events in the network. The LASSIM method is implemented as a general-purpose toolbox using the PyGMO Python package to make the most of multicore computers and high performance clusters, and is available at https://gitlab.com/Gustafsson-lab/lassim. As a method, LASSIM works in two steps, where it first infers a non-linear ODE system of the pre-specified core gene expression. Second, LASSIM in parallel optimizes the parameters that model the regulation of peripheral genes by core system genes. We showed the usefulness of this method by applying LASSIM to infer a large-scale non-linear model of naive Th2 cell differentiation, made possible by integrating Th2 specific bindings, time-series together with six public and six novel siRNA-mediated knock-down experiments. ChIP-seq showed significant overlap for all tested transcription factors. Next, we performed novel time-series measurements of total T-cells during differentiation towards Th2 and verified that our LASSIM model could monitor those data significantly better than comparable models that used the same Th2 bindings. In summary, the LASSIM toolbox opens the door to a new type of model-based data analysis that combines the strengths of reliable mechanistic models with truly systems-level data. We demonstrate the power of this approach by inferring a mechanistically motivated, genome-wide model of the Th2 transcription regulatory system, which plays an important role in several immune related diseases.
41045509	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Multi-view gene panel characterization for spatially resolved omics.	Spatially resolved transcriptomics has revolutionized the study of complex tissues by enabling cellular and subcellular resolution. However, targeted spatial technologies depend on pre-selected gene panels, which are typically curated based on prior biological knowledge or specific research hypotheses. While existing methods often focus on optimizing for cell type identification, we argue that effective panel design should also account for transcriptional variation, pathway-level coverage, and minimal gene redundancy. To meet these broader criteria, we developed a two-part framework: (i) panelScope, a gene panel characterization platform that characterizes panels from multiple perspectives, allowing for holistic comparisons of gene panels for custom panel design; and (ii) panelScope-OA, a genetic algorithm that integrates these characterization metrics into a multi-loss function to automate panel optimization. We applied panelScope and panelScope-OA to characterize nine panels across four datasets. Notably, computationally constructed gene panels performed competitively in capturing major cell types when compared to our in-house manually curated panel. However, refined manual curation offered distinct advantages, particularly in capturing minor cell types. Our results demonstrate the utility of panelScope and panelScope-OA by offering quantitative and multi-dimensional insights to support the design of panels tailored to diverse research needs.
41212773	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	STAHD: a scalable and accurate method to detect spatial domains in high-resolution spatial transcriptomics data.	MOTIVATION: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) enables the study of spatial heterogeneity in tissues. How- ever, current methods struggle with large-scale, high-resolution data, leading to reduced efficiency and accuracy in detecting spatial domains. A scalable, precise solution is urgently needed. RESULTS: We present STAHD, a scalable and efficient framework for spatial domain detection in ST data. Combining a graph attention autoencoder with multilevel k-way graph partitioning, STAHD de- composes large graphs into compact subgraphs and generates low-dimensional embeddings. This improves computational efficiency and clustering accuracy.

39799000	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Supervised analysis of alternative polyadenylation from single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data with spvAPA.	Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is an important driver of transcriptome diversity that generates messenger RNA isoforms with distinct 3' ends. The rapid development of single-cell and spatial transcriptomic technologies opened up new opportunities for exploring APA data to discover hidden cell subpopulations invisible in conventional gene expression analysis. However, conventional gene-level analysis tools are not fully applicable to APA data, and commonly used unsupervised dimensionality reduction methods often disregard experimentally derived annotations such as cell type identities. Here, we proposed a supervised analytical framework termed spvAPA, specifically used for APA analysis from both single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data. First, an iterative imputation method based on weighted nearest neighbor was designed to recover missing APA signatures, by integrating both gene expression and APA modalities. Second, a supervised feature selection method based on sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis was devised to identify APA features distinguishing cell types or spatial morphologies. Additionally, spvAPA improves the visualization of high-dimensional data for discovering novel cell subtypes, which considers APA features and dual modalities of gene expression and APA. Evaluations across nine single-cell and spatial transcriptomics datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of spvAPA. spvAPA is available at https://github.com/BMILAB/spvAPA.

40542418	2025	Genome biology	Comparison of spatial transcriptomics technologies using tumor cryosections.	BACKGROUND: Spatial transcriptomics technologies are revolutionizing our understanding of intra-tumor heterogeneity and the tumor microenvironment by revealing single-cell molecular profiles within their spatial tissue context. The rapid development of spatial transcriptomics methods, each with unique characteristics, makes it challenging to select the most suitable technology for specific research objectives. Here, we compare four imaging-based approaches-RNAscope HiPlex, Molecular Cartography, Merscope, and Xenium-alongside Visium, a sequencing-based method. These technologies were employed to study cryosections of medulloblastoma with extensive nodularity (MBEN), a tumor chosen for its distinct microanatomical features. RESULTS: Our analysis reveals that automated imaging-based spatial transcriptomics methods are well-suited to delineate the intricate MBEN microanatomy and capture cell-type-specific transcriptome profiles. We devise approaches to compare the sensitivity and specificity of different methods, along with their unique attributes, to guide method selection based on the research objective. Furthermore, we demonstrate how reimaging slides after the spatial transcriptomics analysis can significantly improve cell segmentation accuracy and integrate additional transcript and protein readouts, expanding the analytical possibilities and depth of insight. CONCLUSIONS: This study underscores important distinctions between spatial transcriptomics technologies and offers a framework for evaluating their performance. Our findings support informed decisions regarding methods and outline strategies to improve the resolution and scope of spatial transcriptomic analyses, ultimately advancing spatial transcriptomics applications in solid tumor research.
39451157	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	A robust statistical approach for finding informative spatially associated pathways.	Spatial transcriptomics offers deep insights into cellular functional localization and communication by mapping gene expression to spatial locations. Traditional approaches that focus on selecting spatially variable genes often overlook the complexity of biological pathways and the interactions among genes. Here, we introduce a novel framework that shifts the focus towards directly identifying functional pathways associated with spatial variability by adapting the Brownian distance covariance test in an innovative manner to explore the heterogeneity of biological functions over space. Unlike most other methods, this statistical testing approach is free of gene selection and parameter selection and allows nonlinear and complex dependencies. It allows for a deeper understanding of how cells coordinate their activities across different spatial domains through biological pathways. By analyzing real human and mouse datasets, the method found significant pathways that were associated with spatial variation, as well as different pathway patterns among inner- and edge-cancer regions.

39012523	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Unraveling Spatial Domain Characterization in Spatially Resolved Transcriptomics with Robust Graph Contrastive Clustering.	MOTIVATION: Spatial transcriptomics can quantify gene expression and its spatial distribution in tissues, thus revealing molecular mechanisms of cellular interactions underlying tissue heterogeneity, tissue regeneration, and spatially localized disease mechanisms. However, existing spatial clustering methods often fail to exploit the full potential of spatial information, resulting in inaccurate identification of spatial domains. RESULTS: In this paper, we develop a deep graph contrastive clustering framework, stDGCC, that accurately uncovers underlying spatial domains via explicitly modeling spatial information and gene expression profiles from spatial transcriptomics data. The stDGCC framework proposes a spatially informed graph node embedding model to preserve the topological information of spots and to learn the informative and discriminative characterization of spatial transcriptomics data through self-supervised contrastive learning. By simultaneously optimizing the contrastive learning loss, reconstruction loss, and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss, stDGCC achieves joint optimization of feature learning and topology structure preservation in an end-to-end manner. We validate the effectiveness of stDGCC on various spatial transcriptomics datasets acquired from different platforms, each with varying spatial resolutions. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of stDGCC over various state-of-the-art clustering methods in accurately identifying cellular-level biological structures. AVAILABILITY: Code and data are available from https://github.com/TimE9527/stDGCC and https://figshare.com/projects/stDGCC/186525. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
36458905	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Comprehensive visualization of cell-cell interactions in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics with NICHES.	MOTIVATION: Recent years have seen the release of several toolsets that reveal cell-cell interactions from single-cell data. However, all existing approaches leverage mean celltype gene expression values, and do not preserve the single-cell fidelity of the original data. Here, we present NICHES (Niche Interactions and Communication Heterogeneity in Extracellular Signaling), a tool to explore extracellular signaling at the truly single-cell level. RESULTS: NICHES allows embedding of ligand-receptor signal proxies to visualize heterogeneous signaling archetypes within cell clusters, between cell clusters and across experimental conditions. When applied to spatial transcriptomic data, NICHES can be used to reflect local cellular microenvironment. NICHES can operate with any list of ligand-receptor signaling mechanisms, is compatible with existing single-cell packages, and allows rapid, flexible analysis of cell-cell signaling at single-cell resolution. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: NICHES is an open-source software implemented in R under academic free license v3.0 and it is available at http://github.com/msraredon/NICHES. Use-case vignettes are available at https://msraredon.github.io/NICHES/. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
34711971	2021	Nature methods	Deep learning and alignment of spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomes with Tangram.	Charting an organs' biological atlas requires us to spatially resolve the entire single-cell transcriptome, and to relate such cellular features to the anatomical scale. Single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq (sc/snRNA-seq) can profile cells comprehensively, but lose spatial information. Spatial transcriptomics allows for spatial measurements, but at lower resolution and with limited sensitivity. Targeted in situ technologies solve both issues, but are limited in gene throughput. To overcome these limitations we present Tangram, a method that aligns sc/snRNA-seq data to various forms of spatial data collected from the same region, including MERFISH, STARmap, smFISH, Spatial Transcriptomics (Visium) and histological images. Tangram can map any type of sc/snRNA-seq data, including multimodal data such as those from SHARE-seq, which we used to reveal spatial patterns of chromatin accessibility. We demonstrate Tangram on healthy mouse brain tissue, by reconstructing a genome-wide anatomically integrated spatial map at single-cell resolution of the visual and somatomotor areas.

37709912	2024	Nature biotechnology	Self-organizing models of human trunk organogenesis recapitulate spinal cord and spine co-morphogenesis.	Integrated in vitro models of human organogenesis are needed to elucidate the multi-systemic events underlying development and disease. Here we report the generation of human trunk-like structures that model the co-morphogenesis, patterning and differentiation of the human spine and spinal cord. We identified differentiation conditions for human pluripotent stem cells favoring the formation of an embryo-like extending antero-posterior (AP) axis. Single-cell and spatial transcriptomics show that somitic and spinal cord differentiation trajectories organize along this axis and can self-assemble into a neural tube surrounded by somites upon extracellular matrix addition. Morphogenesis is coupled with AP patterning mechanisms, which results, at later stages of organogenesis, in in vivo-like arrays of neural subtypes along a neural tube surrounded by spine and muscle progenitors contacted by neuronal projections. This integrated system of trunk development indicates that in vivo-like multi-tissue co-morphogenesis and topographic organization of terminal cell types can be achieved in human organoids, opening windows for the development of more complex models of organogenesis.
35761387	2022	Genome biology	Widespread redundancy in -omics profiles of cancer mutation states.	BACKGROUND: In studies of cellular function in cancer, researchers are increasingly able to choose from many -omics assays as functional readouts. Choosing the correct readout for a given study can be difficult, and which layer of cellular function is most suitable to capture the relevant signal remains unclear. RESULTS: We consider prediction of cancer mutation status (presence or absence) from functional -omics data as a representative problem that presents an opportunity to quantify and compare the ability of different -omics readouts to capture signals of dysregulation in cancer. From the TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas that contains genetic alteration data, we focus on RNA sequencing, DNA methylation arrays, reverse phase protein arrays (RPPA), microRNA, and somatic mutational signatures as -omics readouts. Across a collection of genes recurrently mutated in cancer, RNA sequencing tends to be the most effective predictor of mutation state. We find that one or more other data types for many of the genes are approximately equally effective predictors. Performance is more variable between mutations than that between data types for the same mutation, and there is little difference between the top data types. We also find that combining data types into a single multi-omics model provides little or no improvement in predictive ability over the best individual data type. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our results, for the design of studies focused on the functional outcomes of cancer mutations, there are often multiple -omics types that can serve as effective readouts, although gene expression seems to be a reasonable default option.
40323307	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	OLS4: a new Ontology Lookup Service for a growing interdisciplinary knowledge ecosystem.	SUMMARY: The Ontology Lookup Service (OLS) is an open source search engine for ontologies which is used extensively in the bioinformatics and chemistry communities to annotate biological and biomedical data with ontology terms. Recently, there has been a significant increase in the size and complexity of ontologies due to new scales of biological knowledge, such as spatial transcriptomics, new ontology development methodologies, and curation on an increased scale. Existing Web-based tools for ontology browsing such as BioPortal and OntoBee do not support the full range of definitions used by today's ontologies. In order to support the community going forward, we have developed OLS4, implementing the complete OWL2 specification, internationalization support for multiple languages, and a new user interface with UX enhancements such as links out to external databases. OLS4 has replaced OLS3 in production at EMBL-EBI and has a backward compatible API supporting users of OLS3 to transition. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code of OLS is available at https://github.com/EBISPOT/ols4 and DOI 10.5281/zenodo.14960290 with Apache 2.0 License. A freely available implementation is accessible at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4.
36809237	2023	PLoS computational biology	Kinome inhibition states and multiomics data enable prediction of cell viability in diverse cancer types.	Protein kinases play a vital role in a wide range of cellular processes, and compounds that inhibit kinase activity emerging as a primary focus for targeted therapy development, especially in cancer. Consequently, efforts to characterize the behavior of kinases in response to inhibitor treatment, as well as downstream cellular responses, have been performed at increasingly large scales. Previous work with smaller datasets have used baseline profiling of cell lines and limited kinome profiling data to attempt to predict small molecule effects on cell viability, but these efforts did not use multi-dose kinase profiles and achieved low accuracy with very limited external validation. This work focuses on two large-scale primary data types, kinase inhibitor profiles and gene expression, to predict the results of cell viability screening. We describe the process by which we combined these data sets, examined their properties in relation to cell viability and finally developed a set of computational models that achieve a reasonably high prediction accuracy (R2 of 0.78 and RMSE of 0.154). Using these models, we identified a set of kinases, several of which are understudied, that are strongly influential in the cell viability prediction models. In addition, we also tested to see if a wider range of multiomics data sets could improve the model results and found that proteomic kinase inhibitor profiles were the single most informative data type. Finally, we validated a small subset of the model predictions in several triple-negative and HER2 positive breast cancer cell lines demonstrating that the model performs well with compounds and cell lines that were not included in the training data set. Overall, this result demonstrates that generic knowledge of the kinome is predictive of very specific cell phenotypes, and has the potential to be integrated into targeted therapy development pipelines.
36549921	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	GSCA: an integrated platform for gene set cancer analysis at genomic, pharmacogenomic and immunogenomic levels.	Cancer initiation and progression are likely caused by the dysregulation of biological pathways. Gene set analysis (GSA) could improve the signal-to-noise ratio and identify potential biological insights on the gene set level. However, platforms exploring cancer multi-omics data using GSA methods are lacking. In this study, we upgraded our GSCALite to GSCA (gene set cancer analysis, http://bioinfo.life.hust.edu.cn/GSCA) for cancer GSA at genomic, pharmacogenomic and immunogenomic levels. In this improved GSCA, we integrated expression, mutation, drug sensitivity and clinical data from four public data sources for 33 cancer types. We introduced useful features to GSCA, including associations between immune infiltration with gene expression and genomic variations, and associations between gene set expression/mutation and clinical outcomes. GSCA has four main functional modules for cancer GSA to explore, analyze and visualize expression, genomic variations, tumor immune infiltration, drug sensitivity and their associations with clinical outcomes. We used case studies of three gene sets: (i) seven cell cycle genes, (ii) tumor suppressor genes of PI3K pathway and (iii) oncogenes of PI3K pathway to prove the advantage of GSCA over single gene analysis. We found novel associations of gene set expression and mutation with clinical outcomes in different cancer types on gene set level, while on single gene analysis level, they are not significant associations. In conclusion, GSCA is a user-friendly web server and a useful resource for conducting hypothesis tests by using GSA methods at genomic, pharmacogenomic and immunogenomic levels.
38557675	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	SpatialcoGCN: deconvolution and spatial information-aware simulation of spatial transcriptomics data via deep graph co-embedding.	Spatial transcriptomics (ST) data have emerged as a pivotal approach to comprehending the function and interplay of cells within intricate tissues. Nonetheless, analyses of ST data are restricted by the low spatial resolution and limited number of ribonucleic acid transcripts that can be detected with several popular ST techniques. In this study, we propose that both of the above issues can be significantly improved by introducing a deep graph co-embedding framework. First, we establish a self-supervised, co-graph convolution network-based deep learning model termed SpatialcoGCN, which leverages single-cell data to deconvolve the cell mixtures in spatial data. Evaluations of SpatialcoGCN on a series of simulated ST data and real ST datasets from human ductal carcinoma in situ, developing human heart and mouse brain suggest that SpatialcoGCN could outperform other state-of-the-art cell type deconvolution methods in estimating per-spot cell composition. Moreover, with competitive accuracy, SpatialcoGCN could also recover the spatial distribution of transcripts that are not detected by raw ST data. With a similar co-embedding framework, we further established a spatial information-aware ST data simulation method, SpatialcoGCN-Sim. SpatialcoGCN-Sim could generate simulated ST data with high similarity to real datasets. Together, our approaches provide efficient tools for studying the spatial organization of heterogeneous cells within complex tissues.
39558096	2024	Nature methods	Probe set selection for targeted spatial transcriptomics.	Targeted spatial transcriptomic methods capture the topology of cell types and states in tissues at single-cell and subcellular resolution by measuring the expression of a predefined set of genes. The selection of an optimal set of probed genes is crucial for capturing the spatial signals present in a tissue. This requires selecting the most informative, yet minimal, set of genes to profile (gene set selection) for which it is possible to build probes (probe design). However, current selections often rely on marker genes, precluding them from detecting continuous spatial signals or new states. We present Spapros, an end-to-end probe set selection pipeline that optimizes both gene set specificity for cell type identification and within-cell type expression variation to resolve spatially distinct populations while considering prior knowledge as well as probe design and expression constraints. We evaluated Spapros and show that it outperforms other selection approaches in both cell type recovery and recovering expression variation beyond cell types. Furthermore, we used Spapros to design a single-cell resolution in situ hybridization on tissues (SCRINSHOT) experiment of adult lung tissue to demonstrate how probes selected with Spapros identify cell types of interest and detect spatial variation even within cell types.
41217759	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	QuiCAT: A Scalable and Flexible Framework for Mapping Synthetic Sequences.	MOTIVATION: Synthetic cellular tagging technologies play a crucial role in cell fate and lineage-tracing studies. Their integration with single-cell and spatial transcriptomics assays has heightened the need for scalable software solutions to analyze such data. However, previous methods are either designed for a subset of tagging technologies, or lack the performance needed for large-scale applications. RESULTS: To address these challenges, we developed Quick Clonal Analysis Toolkit (QuiCAT), an end-to-end Python-based package that streamlines the extraction, clustering, and analysis of synthetic tags from sequencing data. QuiCAT outperforms existing pipelines in both speed and accuracy. Its outputs are widely compatible with the Python ecosystem for single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data analysis packages allowing seamless integrations and downstream analyses. QuiCAT provides users with two workflows: a reference-free approach for extracting and mapping synthetic tags, and a reference-based approach for aligning tags against known sequences. We validate QuiCAT across diverse datasets, including population-level data, single-cell and spatially resolved transcriptomics, and benchmarked it against the two most recently published tools. Our computational optimizations enhance performance while improving accuracy.​. AVAILABILITY: QuiCAT is available as a Python package to be installed. The source code is available at https://github.com/theislab/quicat. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
39271291	2024	Genome research	Long-read transcriptome sequencing of CLL and MDS patients uncovers molecular effects of SF3B1 mutations.	Mutations in splicing factor 3B subunit 1 (SF3B1) frequently occur in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs). These mutations have different effects on the disease prognosis with beneficial effect in MDS and worse prognosis in CLL patients. A full-length transcriptome approach can expand our knowledge on SF3B1 mutation effects on RNA splicing and its contribution to patient survival and treatment options. We applied long-read transcriptome sequencing (LRTS) to 44 MDS and CLL patients, as well as two pairs of isogenic cell lines with and without SF3B1 mutations, and found >60% of novel isoforms. Splicing alterations were largely shared between cancer types and specifically affected the usage of introns and 3' splice sites. Our data highlighted a constrained window at canonical 3' splice sites in which dynamic splice-site switches occurred in SF3B1-mutated patients. Using transcriptome-wide RNA-binding maps and molecular dynamics simulations, we showed multimodal SF3B1 binding at 3' splice sites and predicted reduced RNA binding at the second binding pocket of SF3B1(K700E) Our work presents the hitherto most-complete LRTS study of the SF3B1 mutation in CLL and MDS and provides a resource to study aberrant splicing in cancer. Moreover, we showed that different disease prognosises result most likely from the different cell types expanded during carcinogenesis rather than different mechanisms of action of the mutated SF3B1. These results have important implications for understanding the role of SF3B1 mutations in hematological malignancies and other related diseases.
39007595	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	DeepIDA-GRU: a deep learning pipeline for integrative discriminant analysis of cross-sectional and longitudinal multiview data with applications to inflammatory bowel disease classification.	Biomedical research now commonly integrates diverse data types or views from the same individuals to better understand the pathobiology of complex diseases, but the challenge lies in meaningfully integrating these diverse views. Existing methods often require the same type of data from all views (cross-sectional data only or longitudinal data only) or do not consider any class outcome in the integration method, which presents limitations. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a pipeline that harnesses the power of statistical and deep learning methods to integrate cross-sectional and longitudinal data from multiple sources. In addition, it identifies key variables that contribute to the association between views and the separation between classes, providing deeper biological insights. This pipeline includes variable selection/ranking using linear and nonlinear methods, feature extraction using functional principal component analysis and Euler characteristics, and joint integration and classification using dense feed-forward networks for cross-sectional data and recurrent neural networks for longitudinal data. We applied this pipeline to cross-sectional and longitudinal multiomics data (metagenomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics) from an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) study and identified microbial pathways, metabolites and genes that discriminate by IBD status, providing information on the etiology of IBD. We conducted simulations to compare the two feature extraction methods.
41325188	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Guided Co-clustering Transfer Across Unpaired and Paired single-cell Multi-omics Data.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell multi-omics technologies enable the simultaneous profiling of gene expression and chromatin accessibility, providing complementary insights into cellular identity and gene regulatory mechanisms. However, integrating paired scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data (i.e. profiles from the same single cell) remains challenging due to inherent sparsity, technical noise, and the limited availability of high-quality paired measurements. In contrast, large-scale unpaired scRNA-seq datasets often exhibit robust and biologically meaningful cell cluster structures. RESULTS: We introduce Guided Co-clustering Transfer (GuidedCoC), a novel framework that transfers structural knowledge from unpaired scRNA-seq source data to improve both cell clustering and feature alignment in paired scRNA-seq/scATAC-seq target data. GuidedCoC jointly co-clusters cells and features across modalities and domains via a unified information-theoretic objective, aligning gene expression modules with regulatory elements while implicitly performing cross-modal dimensionality reduction to reduce noise. Additionally, it automatically aligns cell populations across unpaired and paired datasets without requiring explicit annotations. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that GuidedCoC achieves superior clustering accuracy and biological interpretability compared to existing methods. These results highlight the promise of structure-guided transfer learning for robust, scalable, and interpretable integration of single-cell multi-omics data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: GuidedCoC is available as open-source code at https://github.com/No-AgCl/GuidedCoC. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
41203866	2025	Nature methods	Monod: model-based discovery and integration through fitting stochastic transcriptional dynamics to single-cell sequencing data.	Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis centers on illuminating cell diversity and understanding the transcriptional mechanisms underlying cellular function. These datasets are large, noisy and complex. Current analyses prioritize noise removal and dimensionality reduction to tackle these challenges and extract biological insight. We propose an alternative, physical approach to leverage the stochasticity, size and multimodal nature of these data to explicitly distinguish their biological and technical facets while revealing the underlying regulatory processes. With the Python package Monod, we demonstrate how nascent and mature RNA counts, present in most published datasets, can be meaningfully 'integrated' under biophysical models of transcription. By using variation in these modalities, we can identify transcriptional modulation not discernible through changes in average gene expression, quantitatively compare mechanistic hypotheses of gene regulation, analyze transcriptional data from different technologies within a common framework and minimize the use of opaque or distortive normalization and transformation techniques.
18544607	2008	Nucleic acids research	Onto-CC: a web server for identifying Gene Ontology conceptual clusters.	The Gene Ontology (GO) vocabulary has been extensively explored to analyze the functions of coexpressed genes. However, despite its extended use in Biology and Medical Sciences, there are still high levels of uncertainty about which ontology (i.e. Molecular Process, Cellular Component or Molecular Function) should be used, and at which level of specificity. Moreover, the GO database can contain incomplete information resulting from human annotations, or highly influenced by the available knowledge about a specific branch in an ontology. In spite of these drawbacks, there is a trend to ignore these problems and even use GO terms to conduct searches of gene expression profiles (i.e. expression + GO) instead of more cautious approaches that just consider them as an independent source of validation (i.e. expression versus GO). Consequently, propagating the uncertainty and producing biased analysis of the required gene grouping hypotheses. We proposed a web tool, Onto-CC, as an automatic method specially suited for independent explanation/validation of gene grouping hypotheses (e.g. coexpressed genes) based on GO clusters (i.e. expression versus GO). Onto-CC approach reduces the uncertainty of the queries by identifying optimal conceptual clusters that combine terms from different ontologies simultaneously, as well as terms defined at different levels of specificity in the GO hierarchy. To do so, we implemented the EMO-CC methodology to find clusters in structural databases [GO Directed acyclic Graph (DAG) tree], inspired on Conceptual Clustering algorithms. This approach allows the management of optimal cluster sets as potential parallel hypotheses, guided by multiobjective/multimodal optimization techniques. Therefore, we can generate alternative and, still, optimal explanations of queries that can provide new insights for a given problem. Onto-CC has been successfully used to test different medical and biological hypotheses including the explanation and prediction of gene expression profiles resulting from the host response to injuries in the inflammatory problem. Onto-CC provides two versions: Ready2GO, a precalculated EMO-CC for several genomes and an Advanced Onto-CC for custom annotation files (http://gps-tools2.wustl.edu/onto-cc/index.html).
38127088	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	GTAD: a graph-based approach for cell spatial composition inference from integrated scRNA-seq and ST-seq data.	With the emergence of spatial transcriptome sequencing (ST-seq), research now heavily relies on the joint analysis of ST-seq and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to precisely identify cell spatial composition in tissues. However, common methods for combining these datasets often merge data from multiple cells to generate pseudo-ST data, overlooking topological relationships and failing to represent spatial arrangements accurately. We introduce GTAD, a method utilizing the Graph Attention Network for deconvolution of integrated scRNA-seq and ST-seq data. GTAD effectively captures cell spatial relationships and topological structures within tissues using a graph-based approach, enhancing cell-type identification and our understanding of complex tissue cellular landscapes. By integrating scRNA-seq and ST data into a unified graph structure, GTAD outperforms traditional 'pseudo-ST' methods, providing robust and information-rich results. GTAD performs exceptionally well with synthesized spatial data and accurately identifies cell spatial composition in tissues like the mouse cerebral cortex, cerebellum, developing human heart and pancreatic ductal carcinoma. GTAD holds the potential to enhance our understanding of tissue microenvironments and cellular diversity in complex bio-logical systems. The source code is available at https://github.com/zzhjs/GTAD.
41219484	2025	Nature biotechnology	Multimodal learning enables chat-based exploration of single-cell data.	Single-cell sequencing characterizes biological samples at unprecedented scale and detail, but data interpretation remains challenging. Here, we present CellWhisperer, an artificial intelligence (AI) model and software tool for chat-based interrogation of gene expression. We establish a multimodal embedding of transcriptomes and their textual annotations, using contrastive learning on 1 million RNA sequencing profiles with AI-curated descriptions. This embedding informs a large language model that answers user-provided questions about cells and genes in natural-language chats. We benchmark CellWhisperer's performance for zero-shot prediction of cell types and other biological annotations and demonstrate its use for biological discovery in a meta-analysis of human embryonic development. We integrate a CellWhisperer chat box with the CELLxGENE browser, allowing users to interactively explore gene expression through a combined graphical and chat interface. In summary, CellWhisperer leverages large community-scale data repositories to connect transcriptomes and text, thereby enabling interactive exploration of single-cell RNA-sequencing data with natural-language chats.
33219054	2021	Genome research	Predictive modeling of single-cell DNA methylome data enhances integration with transcriptome data.	Single-cell DNA methylation data has become increasingly abundant and has uncovered many genes with a positive correlation between expression and promoter methylation, challenging the common dogma based on bulk data. However, computational tools for analyzing single-cell methylome data are lagging far behind. A number of tasks, including cell type calling and integration with transcriptome data, requires the construction of a robust gene activity matrix as the prerequisite but challenging task. The advent of multi-omics data enables measurement of both DNA methylation and gene expression for the same single cells. Although such data is rather sparse, they are sufficient to train supervised models that capture the complex relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression and predict gene activities at single-cell level. Here, we present methylome association by predictive linkage to expression (MAPLE), a computational framework that learns the association between DNA methylation and expression using both gene- and cell-dependent statistical features. Using multiple data sets generated with different experimental protocols, we show that using predicted gene activity values significantly improves several analysis tasks, including clustering, cell type identification, and integration with transcriptome data. Application of MAPLE revealed several interesting biological insights into the relationship between methylation and gene expression, including asymmetric importance of methylation signals around transcription start site for predicting gene expression, and increased predictive power of methylation signals in promoters located outside CpG islands and shores. With the rapid accumulation of single-cell epigenomics data, MAPLE provides a general framework for integrating such data with transcriptome data.
35066588	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	RadSigBench: a framework for benchmarking functional genomics signatures of cancer cell radiosensitivity.	Multiple transcriptomic predictors of tumour cell radiosensitivity (RS) have been proposed, but they have not been benchmarked against one another or to control models. To address this, we present RadSigBench, a comprehensive benchmarking framework for RS signatures. The approach compares candidate models to those developed from randomly resampled control signatures and from cellular processes integral to the radiation response. Robust evaluation of signature accuracy, both overall and for individual tissues, is performed. The NCI60 and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopaedia datasets are integrated into our workflow. Prediction of two measures of RS is assessed: survival fraction after 2 Gy and mean inactivation dose. We apply the RadSigBench framework to seven prominent published signatures of radiation sensitivity and test for equivalence to control signatures. The mean out-of-sample R2 for the published models on test data was very poor at 0.01 (range: -0.05 to 0.09) for Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and 0.00 (range: -0.19 to 0.19) in the NCI60 data. The accuracy of both published and cellular process signatures investigated was equivalent to the resampled controls, suggesting that these signatures contain limited radiation-specific information. Enhanced modelling strategies are needed for effective prediction of intrinsic RS to inform clinical treatment regimes. We make recommendations for methodological improvements, for example the inclusion of perturbation data, multiomics, advanced machine learning and mechanistic modelling. Our validation framework provides for robust performance assessment of ongoing developments in intrinsic RS prediction.
31329928	2019	Nucleic acids research	Data-driven characterization of molecular phenotypes across heterogeneous sample collections.	Existing large gene expression data repositories hold enormous potential to elucidate disease mechanisms, characterize changes in cellular pathways, and to stratify patients based on molecular profiles. To achieve this goal, integrative resources and tools are needed that allow comparison of results across datasets and data types. We propose an intuitive approach for data-driven stratifications of molecular profiles and benchmark our methodology using the dimensionality reduction algorithm t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) with multi-study and multi-platform data on hematological malignancies. Our approach enables assessing the contribution of biological versus technical variation to sample clustering, direct incorporation of additional datasets to the same low dimensional representation, comparison of molecular disease subtypes identified from separate t-SNE representations, and characterization of the obtained clusters based on pathway databases and additional data. In this manner, we performed an integrative analysis across multi-omics acute myeloid leukemia studies. Our approach indicated new molecular subtypes with differential survival and drug responsiveness among samples lacking fusion genes, including a novel myelodysplastic syndrome-like cluster and a cluster characterized with CEBPA mutations and differential activity of the S-adenosylmethionine-dependent DNA methylation pathway. In summary, integration across multiple studies can help to identify novel molecular disease subtypes and generate insight into disease biology.
34083792	2021	Nature biotechnology	Scalable, multimodal profiling of chromatin accessibility, gene expression and protein levels in single cells.	Recent technological advances have enabled massively parallel chromatin profiling with scATAC-seq (single-cell assay for transposase accessible chromatin by sequencing). Here we present ATAC with select antigen profiling by sequencing (ASAP-seq), a tool to simultaneously profile accessible chromatin and protein levels. Our approach pairs sparse scATAC-seq data with robust detection of hundreds of cell surface and intracellular protein markers and optional capture of mitochondrial DNA for clonal tracking, capturing three distinct modalities in single cells. ASAP-seq uses a bridging approach that repurposes antibody:oligonucleotide conjugates designed for existing technologies that pair protein measurements with single-cell RNA sequencing. Together with DOGMA-seq, an adaptation of CITE-seq (cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing) for measuring gene activity across the central dogma of gene regulation, we demonstrate the utility of systematic multi-omic profiling by revealing coordinated and distinct changes in chromatin, RNA and surface proteins during native hematopoietic differentiation and peripheral blood mononuclear cell stimulation and as a combinatorial decoder and reporter of multiplexed perturbations in primary T cells.
39024032	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Single-cell and spatial multiomic inference of gene regulatory networks using SCRIPro.	MOTIVATION: The burgeoning generation of single-cell or spatial multiomic data allows for the characterization of gene regulation networks (GRNs) at an unprecedented resolution. However, the accurate reconstruction of GRNs from sparse and noisy single-cell or spatial multiomic data remains challenging. RESULTS: Here, we present SCRIPro, a comprehensive computational framework that robustly infers GRNs for both single-cell and spatial multi-omics data. SCRIPro first improves sample coverage through a density clustering approach based on multiomic and spatial similarities. Additionally, SCRIPro scans transcriptional regulator (TR) importance by performing chromatin reconstruction and in silico deletion analyses using a comprehensive reference covering 1,292 human and 994 mouse TRs. Finally, SCRIPro combines TR-target importance scores derived from multiomic data with TR-target expression levels to ensure precise GRN reconstruction. We benchmarked SCRIPro on various datasets, including single-cell multiomic data from human B-cell lymphoma, mouse hair follicle development, Stereo-seq of mouse embryos, and Spatial-ATAC-RNA from mouse brain. SCRIPro outperforms existing motif-based methods and accurately reconstructs cell type-specific, stage-specific, and region-specific GRNs. Overall, SCRIPro emerges as a streamlined and fast method capable of reconstructing TR activities and GRNs for both single-cell and spatial multi-omic data. AVAILABILITY: SCRIPro is available at https://github.com/wanglabtongji/SCRIPro. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
36239391	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	AgingBank: a manually curated knowledgebase and high-throughput analysis platform that provides experimentally supported multi-omics data relevant to aging in multiple species.	Discovering the biological basis of aging is one of the greatest remaining challenges for biomedical field. Work on the biology of aging has discovered a range of interventions and pathways that control aging rate. Thus, we developed AgingBank (http://bio-bigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/AgingBank) which was a manually curated comprehensive database and high-throughput analysis platform that provided experimentally supported multi-omics data relevant to aging in multiple species. AgingBank contained 3771 experimentally verified aging-related multi-omics entries from studies across more than 50 model organisms, including human, mice, worms, flies and yeast. The records included genome (single nucleotide polymorphism, copy number variation and somatic mutation), transcriptome [mRNA, long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), microRNA (miRNA) and circular RNA (circRNA)], epigenome (DNA methylation and histone modification), other modification and regulation elements (transcription factor, enhancer, promoter, gene silence, alternative splicing and RNA editing). In addition, AgingBank was also an online computational analysis platform containing five useful tools (Aging Landscape, Differential Expression Analyzer, Data Heat Mapper, Co-Expression Network and Functional Annotation Analyzer), nearly 112 high-throughput experiments of genes, miRNAs, lncRNAs, circRNAs and methylation sites related with aging.

36300629	2023	Nucleic acids research	IAnimal: a cross-species omics knowledgebase for animals.	With the exponential growth of multi-omics data, its integration and utilization have brought unprecedented opportunities for the interpretation of gene regulation mechanisms and the comprehensive analyses of biological systems. IAnimal (https://ianimal.pro/), a cross-species, multi-omics knowledgebase, was developed to improve the utilization of massive public data and simplify the integration of multi-omics information to mine the genetic mechanisms of objective traits. Currently, IAnimal provides 61 191 individual omics data of genome (WGS), transcriptome (RNA-Seq), epigenome (ChIP-Seq, ATAC-Seq) and genome annotation information for 21 species, such as mice, pigs, cattle, chickens, and macaques. The scale of its total clean data has reached 846.46 TB. To better understand the biological significance of omics information, a deep learning model for IAnimal was built based on BioBERT and AutoNER to mine 'gene' and 'trait' entities from 2 794 237 abstracts, which has practical significance for comprehending how each omics layer regulates genes to affect traits. By means of user-friendly web interfaces, flexible data application programming interfaces, and abundant functional modules, IAnimal enables users to easily query, mine, and visualize characteristics in various omics, and to infer how genes play biological roles under the influence of various omics layers.
40581778	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scGT:integration algorithm for single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq based on graph transformer.	MOTIVATION: Multi-omics analysis of individual cells offers remarkable opportunities for exploring the dynamics and relationships of gene regulatory states across large atlas data. However, the current integration algorithms have limited performance, largely due to ignoring the impact of correlation features within the dataset on the discrepancies between omics. RESULTS: In this study, we propose scGT, a model based on Graph Transformer for single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data, which leverages the robust graph structures strengthened by correlation features present in each raw dataset to harmonize representations of multi-omics data, enabling the integration of multi-omics and effective label transfer. We compare scGT with other state-of-the-art methods on paired and unpaired datasets. The results show that scGT accomplishes more accurate label transfer and is capable of integrating datasets with millions of cells. Meanwhile, scGT achieves better performance for preserving biological variation during integration.

37386189	2023	Nature methods	MultiVI: deep generative model for the integration of multimodal data.	Jointly profiling the transcriptome, chromatin accessibility and other molecular properties of single cells offers a powerful way to study cellular diversity. Here we present MultiVI, a probabilistic model to analyze such multiomic data and leverage it to enhance single-modality datasets.

It is available at scvi-tools.org .
39800872	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Integrating scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq with inter-type attention heterogeneous graph neural networks.	Single-cell multi-omics techniques, which enable the simultaneous measurement of multiple modalities such as RNA gene expression and Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin (ATAC) within individual cells, have become a powerful tool for deciphering the intricate complexity of cellular systems. Most current methods rely on motif databases to establish cross-modality relationships between genes from RNA-seq data and peaks from ATAC-seq data. However, these approaches are constrained by incomplete database coverage, particularly for novel or poorly characterized relationships. To address these limitations, we introduce single-cell Multi-omics Integration (scMI), a heterogeneous graph embedding method that encodes both cells and modality features from single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data into a shared latent space by learning cross-modality relationships. By modeling cells and modality features as distinct node types, we design an inter-type attention mechanism to effectively capture long-range cross-modality interactions between genes and peaks. Benchmark results demonstrate that embeddings learned by scMI preserve more biological information and achieve comparable or superior performance in downstream tasks including modality prediction, cell clustering, and gene regulatory network inference compared to methods that rely on databases. Furthermore, scMI significantly improves the alignment and integration of unmatched multi-omics data, enabling more accurate embedding and improved outcomes in downstream tasks.
34963480	2021	Genome biology	Cobolt: integrative analysis of multimodal single-cell sequencing data.	A growing number of single-cell sequencing platforms enable joint profiling of multiple omics from the same cells. We present Cobolt, a novel method that not only allows for analyzing the data from joint-modality platforms, but provides a coherent framework for the integration of multiple datasets measured on different modalities. We demonstrate its performance on multi-modality data of gene expression and chromatin accessibility and illustrate the integration abilities of Cobolt by jointly analyzing this multi-modality data with single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq datasets.

Spatial domain identification is crucial in spatial transcriptomics analysis. Existing methods excel with continuous and clustered distributions but struggle with discrete ones. We present spaMGCN, an innovative approach specifically designed for identifying spatial domains, especially in discrete tissue distributions. By integrating spatial transcriptomics and spatial epigenomic data through an autoencoder and a multi-scale adaptive graph convolutional network, spaMGCN outperforms baseline methods. Our evaluations demonstrate its effectiveness in recognizing discrete T cell zones in mouse spleens and follicular cells in human lymph nodes, as well as effectively distinguishing capsule structures from surrounding tissues.
35849618	2022	PLoS computational biology	Single-cell network biology characterizes cell type gene regulation for drug repurposing and phenotype prediction in Alzheimer's disease.	Dysregulation of gene expression in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains elusive, especially at the cell type level. Gene regulatory network, a key molecular mechanism linking transcription factors (TFs) and regulatory elements to govern gene expression, can change across cell types in the human brain and thus serve as a model for studying gene dysregulation in AD. However, AD-induced regulatory changes across brain cell types remains uncharted. To address this, we integrated single-cell multi-omics datasets to predict the gene regulatory networks of four major cell types, excitatory and inhibitory neurons, microglia and oligodendrocytes, in control and AD brains. Importantly, we analyzed and compared the structural and topological features of networks across cell types and examined changes in AD. Our analysis shows that hub TFs are largely common across cell types and AD-related changes are relatively more prominent in some cell types (e.g., microglia). The regulatory logics of enriched network motifs (e.g., feed-forward loops) further uncover cell type-specific TF-TF cooperativities in gene regulation. The cell type networks are also highly modular and several network modules with cell-type-specific expression changes in AD pathology are enriched with AD-risk genes. The further disease-module-drug association analysis suggests cell-type candidate drugs and their potential target genes. Finally, our network-based machine learning analysis systematically prioritized cell type risk genes likely involved in AD. Our strategy is validated using an independent dataset which showed that top ranked genes can predict clinical phenotypes (e.g., cognitive impairment) of AD with reasonable accuracy. Overall, this single-cell network biology analysis provides a comprehensive map linking genes, regulatory networks, cell types and drug targets and reveals cell-type gene dysregulation in AD.
34586379	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Multiomix: a cloud-based platform to infer cancer genomic and epigenomic events associated with gene expression modulation.	MOTIVATION: Large-scale cancer genome projects have generated genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic and clinicopathological data from thousands of samples in almost every human tumor site. Although most omics data and their associated resources are publicly available, its full integration and interpretation to dissect the sources of gene expression modulation require specialized knowledge and software. RESULTS: We present Multiomix, an interactive cloud-based platform that allows biologists to identify genetic and epigenetic events associated with the transcriptional modulation of cancer-related genes through the analysis of multi-omics data available on public functional genomic databases or user-uploaded datasets. Multiomix consists of an integrated set of functions, pipelines and a graphical user interface that allows retrieval, aggregation, analysis and visualization of different omics data sources. After the user provides the data to be analyzed, Multiomix identifies all significant correlations between mRNAs and non-mRNA genomics features (e.g. miRNA, DNA methylation and CNV) across the genome, the predicted sequence-based interactions (e.g. miRNA-mRNA) and their associated prognostic values. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Multiomix is available at https://www.multiomix.org. The source code is freely available at https://github.com/omics-datascience/multiomix. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
35347329	2022	Nature biotechnology	Integrative spatial analysis of cell morphologies and transcriptional states with MUSE.	Spatial transcriptomics enables the simultaneous measurement of morphological features and transcriptional profiles of the same cells or regions in tissues. Here we present multi-modal structured embedding (MUSE), an approach to characterize cells and tissue regions by integrating morphological and spatially resolved transcriptional data. We demonstrate that MUSE can discover tissue subpopulations missed by either modality as well as compensate for modality-specific noise. We apply MUSE to diverse datasets containing spatial transcriptomics (seqFISH+, STARmap or Visium) and imaging (hematoxylin and eosin or fluorescence microscopy) modalities. MUSE identified biologically meaningful tissue subpopulations and stereotyped spatial patterning in healthy brain cortex and intestinal tissues. In diseased tissues, MUSE revealed gene biomarkers for proximity to tumor region and heterogeneity of amyloid precursor protein processing across Alzheimer brain regions. MUSE enables the integration of multi-modal data to provide insights into the states, functions and organization of cells in complex biological tissues.
32053182	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	ZIAQ: a quantile regression method for differential expression analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has enabled the simultaneous transcriptomic profiling of individual cells under different biological conditions. scRNA-seq data have two unique challenges that can affect the sensitivity and specificity of single-cell differential expression analysis: a large proportion of expressed genes with zero or low read counts ('dropout' events) and multimodal data distributions. RESULTS: We have developed a zero-inflation-adjusted quantile (ZIAQ) algorithm, which is the first method to account for both dropout rates and complex scRNA-seq data distributions in the same model. ZIAQ demonstrates superior performance over several existing methods on simulated scRNA-seq datasets by finding more differentially expressed genes. When ZIAQ was applied to the comparison of neoplastic and non-neoplastic cells from a human glioblastoma dataset, the ranking of biologically relevant genes and pathways showed clear improvement over existing methods. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: ZIAQ is implemented in the R language and available at https://github.com/gefeizhang/ZIAQ. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
27694350	2017	Briefings in bioinformatics	Optimization of cell lines as tumour models by integrating multi-omics data.	Cell lines are widely used as in vitro models of tumorigenesis. However, an increasing number of researchers have found that cell lines differ from their sourced tumour samples after long-term cell culture. The application of unsuitable cell lines in experiments will affect the experimental accuracy and the treatment of patients. Therefore, it is imperative to identify optimal cell lines for each cancer type. Here, we review the methods used to evaluate cell lines since 2005. Furthermore, gene expression, copy number and mutation profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia are used to calculate similarity between tumours and cell lines. Then, the ideal cell lines to use for experiments for eight types of cancers are found by combining the results with Gene Ontology functional similarity. After verification, the optimal cell lines have the same genomic characteristics as their homologous tumour samples. The contaminated cell lines identified in previous research are also determined to be unsuitable in vitro cancer models here. Moreover, our study suggests that some of the commonly used cell lines are not suitable cancer models. In summary, we provide a reference for ideal cell lines to use in in vitro experiments and contribute to improving the accuracy of future cancer research. Furthermore, this research provides a foundation for identifying more effective treatment strategies.
26969681	2016	Briefings in bioinformatics	Dimension reduction techniques for the integrative analysis of multi-omics data.	State-of-the-art next-generation sequencing, transcriptomics, proteomics and other high-throughput 'omics' technologies enable the efficient generation of large experimental data sets. These data may yield unprecedented knowledge about molecular pathways in cells and their role in disease. Dimension reduction approaches have been widely used in exploratory analysis of single omics data sets. This review will focus on dimension reduction approaches for simultaneous exploratory analyses of multiple data sets. These methods extract the linear relationships that best explain the correlated structure across data sets, the variability both within and between variables (or observations) and may highlight data issues such as batch effects or outliers. We explore dimension reduction techniques as one of the emerging approaches for data integration, and how these can be applied to increase our understanding of biological systems in normal physiological function and disease.
40954301	2025	Nature methods	Spatial gene expression at single-cell resolution from histology using deep learning with GHIST.	The increased use of spatially resolved transcriptomics provides new biological insights into disease mechanisms. However, the high cost and complexity of these methods are barriers to broader application. Consequently, methods have been created to predict spot-based gene expression from routinely collected histology images. Recent benchmarking showed that current methodologies have limited accuracy and spatial resolution, constraining translational capacity. Here, we introduce GHIST, a deep learning-based framework that predicts spatial gene expression at single-cell resolution by leveraging subcellular spatial transcriptomics and synergistic relationships between multiple layers of biological information. We validated GHIST using public datasets and The Cancer Genome Atlas data, demonstrating its flexibility across different spatial resolutions and superior performance. Our results underscore the utility of in silico generation of single-cell spatial gene expression measurements and the capacity to enrich existing datasets with a spatially resolved omics modality, paving the way for scalable multi-omics analysis and biomarker identification.
38228777	2024	Nature biotechnology	Decoder-seq enhances mRNA capture efficiency in spatial RNA sequencing.	Spatial transcriptomics technologies with high resolution often lack high sensitivity in mRNA detection. Here we report a dendrimeric DNA coordinate barcoding design for spatial RNA sequencing (Decoder-seq), which offers both high sensitivity and high resolution. Decoder-seq combines dendrimeric nanosubstrates with microfluidic coordinate barcoding to generate spatial arrays with a DNA density approximately ten times higher than previously reported methods while maintaining flexibility in resolution. We show that the high RNA capture efficiency of Decoder-seq improved the detection of lowly expressed olfactory receptor (Olfr) genes in mouse olfactory bulbs and contributed to the discovery of a unique layer enrichment pattern for two Olfr genes. The near-cellular resolution provided by Decoder-seq has enabled the construction of a spatial single-cell atlas of the mouse hippocampus, revealing dendrite-enriched mRNAs in neurons. When applying Decoder-seq to human renal cell carcinomas, we dissected the heterogeneous tumor microenvironment across different cancer subtypes and identified spatial gradient-expressed genes related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition with the potential to predict tumor prognosis and progression.
34585247	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	A versatile and scalable single-cell data integration algorithm based on domain-adversarial and variational approximation.	"Single-cell technologies provide us new ways to profile transcriptomic landscape, chromatin accessibility, spatial expression patterns in heterogeneous tissues at the resolution of single cell. With enormous generated single-cell datasets, a key analytic challenge is to integrate these datasets to gain biological insights into cellular compositions. Here, we developed a domain-adversarial and variational approximation, DAVAE, which can integrate multiple single-cell datasets across samples, technologies and modalities with a single strategy. Besides, DAVAE can also integrate paired data of ATAC profile and transcriptome profile that are simultaneously measured from a same cell. With a mini-batch stochastic gradient descent strategy, it is scalable for large-scale data and can be accelerated by GPUs. Results on seven real data integration applications demonstrated the effectiveness and scalability of DAVAE in batch-effect removing, transfer learning and cell-type predictions for multiple single-cell datasets across samples, technologies and modalities. Availability: DAVAE has been implemented in a toolkit package ""scbean"" in the pypi repository, and the source code can be also freely accessible at https://github.com/jhu99/scbean. All our data and source code for reproducing the results of this paper can be accessible at https://github.com/jhu99/davae_paper."
36585456	2023	Nature methods	Optimizing multiplexed imaging experimental design through tissue spatial segregation estimation.	Recent advances in multiplexed imaging methods allow simultaneous detection of dozens of proteins and hundreds of RNAs, enabling deep spatial characterization of both healthy and diseased tissues. Parameters for the design of optimal multiplex imaging studies, especially those estimating how much area has to be imaged to capture all cell phenotype clusters, are lacking. Here, using a spatial transcriptomic atlas of healthy and tumor human tissues, we developed a statistical framework that determines the number and area of fields of view necessary to accurately identify all cell phenotypes that are part of a tissue. Using this strategy on imaging mass cytometry data, we identified a measurement of tissue spatial segregation that enables optimal experimental design. This strategy will enable an improved design of multiplexed imaging studies.
41335468	2025	Nucleic acids research	CelLink: integrating single-cell multi-omics data with weak feature linkage and imbalanced cell populations.	Single-cell multi-omics technologies capture complementary molecular layers, enabling a comprehensive view of cellular states and functions. However, integrating these data types poses significant challenges when their features are weakly linked and cell population sizes are imbalanced. Currently, no method efficiently addresses these two issues simultaneously. Therefore, we developed CelLink, a novel single-cell multi-omics data integration method designed to overcome these challenges. CelLink normalizes and smooths feature profiles to align scales across datasets and integrates them through a multi-phase pipeline that iteratively employs the optimal transport algorithm. It dynamically refines cell-cell correspondences, identifying and excluding cells that cannot be reliably matched, thus avoiding performance degradation caused by erroneous imputations. This approach effectively adapts to weak feature linkage and imbalanced cell populations between datasets. Benchmarking CelLink on scRNA-seq and spatial proteomics datasets, as well as paired CITE-seq data, demonstrates its superior performance across various evaluation metrics, including data mixing, cell manifold structure preservation, and feature imputation accuracy. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, CelLink significantly outperforms others in imbalanced cell populations while consistently achieving better performance for balanced datasets. Moreover, CelLink uniquely enables cell subtype annotation, correction of mislabeled cells, and spatial transcriptomic analyses by imputing transcriptomic profiles for spatial proteomics data. Its great ability to impute large-scale paired single-cell multi-omics data positions it pivotal for building single-cell multi-modal foundation models and spatial cellular biology.
39123269	2024	Genome biology	Benchmarking clustering, alignment, and integration methods for spatial transcriptomics.	BACKGROUND: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is advancing our understanding of complex tissues and organisms. However, building a robust clustering algorithm to define spatially coherent regions in a single tissue slice and aligning or integrating multiple tissue slices originating from diverse sources for essential downstream analyses remains challenging. Numerous clustering, alignment, and integration methods have been specifically designed for ST data by leveraging its spatial information. The absence of comprehensive benchmark studies complicates the selection of methods and future method development. RESULTS: In this study, we systematically benchmark a variety of state-of-the-art algorithms with a wide range of real and simulated datasets of varying sizes, technologies, species, and complexity. We analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each method using diverse quantitative and qualitative metrics and analyses, including eight metrics for spatial clustering accuracy and contiguity, uniform manifold approximation and projection visualization, layer-wise and spot-to-spot alignment accuracy, and 3D reconstruction, which are designed to assess method performance as well as data quality. The code used for evaluation is available on our GitHub. Additionally, we provide online notebook tutorials and documentation to facilitate the reproduction of all benchmarking results and to support the study of new methods and new datasets. CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses lead to comprehensive recommendations that cover multiple aspects, helping users to select optimal tools for their specific needs and guide future method development.
39800874	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	CellMsg: graph convolutional networks for ligand-receptor-mediated cell-cell communication analysis.	The role of cell-cell communications (CCCs) is increasingly recognized as being important to differentiation, invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance in tumoral tissues. Developing CCC inference methods using traditional experimental methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, cannot handle large amounts of data. To facilitate inference of CCCs, we proposed a computational framework, called CellMsg, which involves two primary steps: identifying ligand-receptor interactions (LRIs) and measuring the strength of LRIs-mediated CCCs. Specifically, CellMsg first identifies high-confident LRIs based on multimodal features of ligands and receptors and graph convolutional networks. Then, CellMsg measures the strength of intercellular communication by combining the identified LRIs and single-cell RNA-seq data using a three-point estimation method. Performance evaluation on four benchmark LRI datasets by five-fold cross validation demonstrated that CellMsg accurately captured the relationships between ligands and receptors, resulting in the identification of high-confident LRIs. Compared with other methods of identifying LRIs, CellMsg has better prediction performance and robustness. Furthermore, the LRIs identified by CellMsg were successfully validated through molecular docking. Finally, we examined the overlap of LRIs between CellMsg and five other classical CCC databases, as well as the intercellular crosstalk among seven cell types within a human melanoma tissue. In summary, CellMsg establishes a complete, reliable, and well-organized LRI database and an effective CCC strength evaluation method for each single-cell RNA-seq data. It provides a computational tool allowing researchers to decipher intercellular communications. CellMsg is freely available at https://github.com/pengsl-lab/CellMsg.
40179111	2025	PLoS computational biology	Integrating multiple spatial transcriptomics data using community-enhanced graph contrastive learning.	Due to the rapid development of spatial sequencing technologies, large amounts of spatial transcriptomic datasets have been generated across various technological platforms or different biological conditions (e.g., control vs. treatment). Spatial transcriptomics data coming from different platforms usually has different resolutions. Moreover, current methods do not consider the heterogeneity of spatial structures within and across slices when modeling spatial transcriptomics data with graph-based methods. In this study, we propose a community-enhanced graph contrastive learning-based method named Tacos to integrate multiple spatial transcriptomics data. We applied Tacos to several real datasets coming from different platforms under different scenarios. Systematic benchmark analyses demonstrate Tacos's superior performance in integrating different slices. Furthermore, Tacos can accurately denoise the spatially resolved transcriptomics data.
35273392	2022	Nature methods	Museum of spatial transcriptomics.	The function of many biological systems, such as embryos, liver lobules, intestinal villi, and tumors, depends on the spatial organization of their cells. In the past decade, high-throughput technologies have been developed to quantify gene expression in space, and computational methods have been developed that leverage spatial gene expression data to identify genes with spatial patterns and to delineate neighborhoods within tissues. To comprehensively document spatial gene expression technologies and data-analysis methods, we present a curated review of literature on spatial transcriptomics dating back to 1987, along with a thorough analysis of trends in the field, such as usage of experimental techniques, species, tissues studied, and computational approaches used. Our Review places current methods in a historical context, and we derive insights about the field that can guide current research strategies.

36095130	2022	Nucleic acids research	A spatiotemporal atlas of organogenesis in the development of orchid flowers.	Development of floral organs exhibits complex molecular mechanisms involving the co-regulation of many genes specialized and precisely functioning in various tissues and developing stages. Advance in spatial transcriptome technologies allows for quantitative measurement of spatially localized gene abundance making it possible to bridge complex scenario of flower organogenesis with genome-wide molecular phenotypes. Here, we apply the 10x Visium technology in the study of the formation of floral organs through development in an orchid plant, Phalaenopsis Big Chili. Cell-types of early floral development including inflorescence meristems, primordia of floral organs and identity determined tissues, are recognized based on spatial expression distribution of thousands of genes in high resolution. In addition, meristematic cells on the basal position of floral organs are found to continuously function in multiple developmental stages after organ initiation. Particularly, the development of anther, which primordium starts from a single spot to multiple differentiated cell-types in later stages including pollinium and other vegetative tissues, is revealed by well-known MADS-box genes and many other downstream regulators. The spatial transcriptome analyses provide comprehensive information of gene activity for understanding the molecular architecture of flower organogenesis and for future genomic and genetic studies of specific cell-types.
41182756	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Joint similarity nonnegative matrix factorization model for identification of recurrence-related association patterns in tumor.	The high recurrence rate of tumor limits the growth of precision medicine, whereas the exploration of correlations in multimodal data enables mining of features linked to tumor recurrence, ultimately identifying prospective biomarkers. Nevertheless, existing multimodal approaches centered on genetic molecular data inadequately leveraged data structure and ignored the involvement of genes in the pathway or biological processes, thereby hampering interpretability of association models. In this study, a novel joint similarity nonnegative matrix factorization (JSNMF) model based on data-driven idea was proposed by adding pathway scoring data based on utilizing pathological images of tumor, gene expression data. The similarity network fusion model was applied to calculate the fusion matrices of the three-modality data with tumor recurrence as the label. Additionally, the prior information was calculated using the principal component analysis method, which was then applied to the joint nonnegative matrix factorization model with network regularization constraints. The solving efficiency of JSNMF model was enhanced by incorporating sparse orthogonality constraints on objective function. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating prior knowledge enhances the search efficiency for joint patterns across multimodal data. The model identified recurrence-related common modules, including cellular features, genes, and pathways. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that the model can identify potential biomarkers associated with immune cell infiltration levels for recurrence diagnosis. Furthermore, the proposed method provides a new perspective for mining task-specific associations in multimodal data. This study also improves understanding of association patterns among genetic molecular features linked to tumor recurrence.
33875865	2021	Nature biotechnology	Spatial tissue profiling by imaging-free molecular tomography.	Several techniques are currently being developed for spatially resolved omics profiling, but each new method requires the setup of specific detection strategies or specialized instrumentation. Here we describe an imaging-free framework to localize high-throughput readouts within a tissue by cutting the sample into thin strips in a way that allows subsequent image reconstruction. We implemented this framework to transform a low-input RNA sequencing protocol into an imaging-free spatial transcriptomics technique (called STRP-seq) and validated it by profiling the spatial transcriptome of the mouse brain. We applied the technique to the brain of the Australian bearded dragon, Pogona vitticeps. Our results reveal the molecular anatomy of the telencephalon of this lizard, providing evidence for a marked regionalization of the reptilian pallium and subpallium. We expect that STRP-seq can be used to derive spatially resolved data from a range of other omics techniques.
38641849	2024	Genome biology	spVC for the detection and interpretation of spatial gene expression variation.	Spatially resolved transcriptomics technologies have opened new avenues for understanding gene expression heterogeneity in spatial contexts. However, existing methods for identifying spatially variable genes often focus solely on statistical significance, limiting their ability to capture continuous expression patterns and integrate spot-level covariates. To address these challenges, we introduce spVC, a statistical method based on a generalized Poisson model. spVC seamlessly integrates constant and spatially varying effects of covariates, facilitating comprehensive exploration of gene expression variability and enhancing interpretability. Simulation and real data applications confirm spVC's accuracy in these tasks, highlighting its versatility in spatial transcriptomics analysis.
41241818	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	stTrace: detecting spatial-temporal domains from spatial transcriptome to trace developmental path.	"Development shapes the growth and organization of organisms, enabling the emergence of complex biological structures and functions. Investigating the development process is vital for uncovering the formation of complex biological systems. However, current approaches to studying development from gene expression rely primarily on single-cell gene expression data to infer developmental trajectories, neglecting the spatial distribution of cells within tissues and their interactions. Although spatial transcriptomics provides spatial context for gene expression, existing algorithms focus mainly on identifying spatial regions without further exploring their developmental connections. In this study, we propose an algorithm for detecting spatial-temporal domains in tissue to trace developmental path (stTrace) using spatial transcriptomics. stTrace integrates the degree of cell development, gene expression, and spatial location to identify ""spatial-temporal domains,"" regions where cells share similar functions and developmental stages within the tissue. Moreover, hierarchical relationships exist among these domains, reflecting developmental connections between cells in the tissue. Applied to mouse embryo and human breast cancer datasets, stTrace achieved higher resolution and developmental consistency than traditional spatial domain identification algorithms. In the mouse dataset, spatial-temporal domains identified by stTrace in brain and eye areas have significant gene expression differences, while in human cancer data, it enabled reconstruction of a developmental tree that inferred cancer cell spread directions consistent with marker gene expression patterns."
36250636	2022	Nucleic acids research	DeepST: identifying spatial domains in spatial transcriptomics by deep learning.	Recent advances in spatial transcriptomics (ST) have brought unprecedented opportunities to understand tissue organization and function in spatial context. However, it is still challenging to precisely dissect spatial domains with similar gene expression and histology in situ. Here, we present DeepST, an accurate and universal deep learning framework to identify spatial domains, which performs better than the existing state-of-the-art methods on benchmarking datasets of the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Further testing on a breast cancer ST dataset, we showed that DeepST can dissect spatial domains in cancer tissue at a finer scale. Moreover, DeepST can achieve not only effective batch integration of ST data generated from multiple batches or different technologies, but also expandable capabilities for processing other spatial omics data. Together, our results demonstrate that DeepST has the exceptional capacity for identifying spatial domains, making it a desirable tool to gain novel insights from ST studies.
35380624	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	JSNMF enables effective and accurate integrative analysis of single-cell multiomics data.	The single-cell multiomics technologies provide an unprecedented opportunity to study the cellular heterogeneity from different layers of transcriptional regulation. However, the datasets generated from these technologies tend to have high levels of noise, making data analysis challenging. Here, we propose jointly semi-orthogonal nonnegative matrix factorization (JSNMF), which is a versatile toolkit for the integrative analysis of transcriptomic and epigenomic data profiled from the same cell. JSNMF enables data visualization and clustering of the cells and also facilitates downstream analysis, including the characterization of markers and functional pathway enrichment analysis. The core of JSNMF is an unsupervised method based on JSNMF, where it assumes different latent variables for the two molecular modalities, and integrates the information of transcriptomic and epigenomic data with consensus graph fusion, which better tackles the distinct characteristics and levels of noise across different molecular modalities in single-cell multiomics data. We applied JSNMF to single-cell multiomics datasets from different tissues and different technologies. The results demonstrate the superior performance of JSNMF in clustering and data visualization of the cells. JSNMF also allows joint analysis of multiple single-cell multiomics experiments and single-cell multiomics data with more than two modalities profiled on the same cell. JSNMF also provides rich biological insight on the markers, cell-type-specific region-gene associations and the functions of the identified cell subpopulation.
37811889	2024	Nucleic acids research	SoyMD: a platform combining multi-omics data with various tools for soybean research and breeding.	Advanced multi-omics technologies offer much information that can uncover the regulatory mechanisms from genotype to phenotype. In soybean, numerous multi-omics databases have been published. Although they cover multiple omics, there are still limitations when it comes to the types and scales of omics datasets and analysis methods utilized. This study aims to address these limitations by collecting and integrating a comprehensive set of multi-omics datasets. This includes 38 genomes, transcriptomes from 435 tissue samples, 125 phenotypes from 6686 accessions, epigenome data involving histone modification, transcription factor binding, chromosomal accessibility and chromosomal interaction, as well as genetic variation data from 24 501 soybean accessions. Then, common analysis pipelines and statistical methods were applied to mine information from these multi-omics datasets, resulting in the successful establishment of a user-friendly multi-omics database called SoyMD (https://yanglab.hzau.edu.cn/SoyMD/#/). SoyMD provides researchers with efficient query options and analysis tools, allowing them to swiftly access relevant omics information and conduct comprehensive multi-omics data analyses. Another notable feature of SoyMD is its capability to facilitate the analysis of candidate genes, as demonstrated in the case study on seed oil content. This highlights the immense potential of SoyMD in soybean genetic breeding and functional genomics research.
32955565	2020	Nucleic acids research	SpaGE: Spatial Gene Enhancement using scRNA-seq.	Single-cell technologies are emerging fast due to their ability to unravel the heterogeneity of biological systems. While scRNA-seq is a powerful tool that measures whole-transcriptome expression of single cells, it lacks their spatial localization. Novel spatial transcriptomics methods do retain cells spatial information but some methods can only measure tens to hundreds of transcripts. To resolve this discrepancy, we developed SpaGE, a method that integrates spatial and scRNA-seq datasets to predict whole-transcriptome expressions in their spatial configuration. Using five dataset-pairs, SpaGE outperformed previously published methods and showed scalability to large datasets. Moreover, SpaGE predicted new spatial gene patterns that are confirmed independently using in situ hybridization data from the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas.
39235988	2024	PLoS computational biology	MVST: Identifying spatial domains of spatial transcriptomes from multiple views using multi-view graph convolutional networks.	Spatial transcriptome technology can parse transcriptomic data at the spatial level to detect high-throughput gene expression and preserve information regarding the spatial structure of tissues. Identifying spatial domains, that is identifying regions with similarities in gene expression and histology, is the most basic and critical aspect of spatial transcriptome data analysis. Most current methods identify spatial domains only through a single view, which may obscure certain important information and thus fail to make full use of the information embedded in spatial transcriptome data. Therefore, we propose an unsupervised clustering framework based on multiview graph convolutional networks (MVST) to achieve accurate spatial domain recognition by the learning graph embedding features of neighborhood graphs constructed from gene expression information, spatial location information, and histopathological image information through multiview graph convolutional networks. By exploring spatial transcriptomes from multiple views, MVST enables data from all parts of the spatial transcriptome to be comprehensively and fully utilized to obtain more accurate spatial expression patterns. We verified the effectiveness of MVST on real spatial transcriptome datasets, the robustness of MVST on some simulated datasets, and the reasonableness of the framework structure of MVST in ablation experiments, and from the experimental results, it is clear that MVST can achieve a more accurate spatial domain identification compared with the current more advanced methods. In conclusion, MVST is a powerful tool for spatial transcriptome research with improved spatial domain recognition.
34845373	2022	Nature biotechnology	Super-resolved spatial transcriptomics by deep data fusion.	Current methods for spatial transcriptomics are limited by low spatial resolution. Here we introduce a method that integrates spatial gene expression data with histological image data from the same tissue section to infer higher-resolution expression maps. Using a deep generative model, our method characterizes the transcriptome of micrometer-scale anatomical features and can predict spatial gene expression from histology images alone.
36124793	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	GNN-SubNet: disease subnetwork detection with explainable graph neural networks.	MOTIVATION: The tremendous success of graphical neural networks (GNNs) already had a major impact on systems biology research. For example, GNNs are currently being used for drug target recognition in protein-drug interaction networks, as well as for cancer gene discovery and more. Important aspects whose practical relevance is often underestimated are comprehensibility, interpretability and explainability. RESULTS: In this work, we present a novel graph-based deep learning framework for disease subnetwork detection via explainable GNNs. Each patient is represented by the topology of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, and the nodes are enriched with multi-omics features from gene expression and DNA methylation. In addition, we propose a modification of the GNNexplainer that provides model-wide explanations for improved disease subnetwork detection. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The proposed methods and tools are implemented in the GNN-SubNet Python package, which we have made available on our GitHub for the international research community (https://github.com/pievos101/GNN-SubNet). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
41099696	2025	Nucleic acids research	GQ-DNABERT reveals GQ proximal enhancer-promoter interactions associated with tissue-specific transcription.	Alternative DNA conformation formed by sequences called flipons are thought to play an important role in regulating various genomic processes, either repressing or enhancing transcription, chromatin organization, DNA repair, telomere maintenance, RNA splicing, translation, and stress responses. The formation of G-quadruplexes (GQs) has been investigated experimentally using various methodologies with varying degrees of overlap between the results underscoring the need for a gold-standard GQ dataset. With this aim we trained a large language model, GQ-DNABERT using EndoQuad, the most comprehensive human GQ dataset. GQ-DNABERT recalled the training data and predicted de novo GQs in intergenic and intronic regions, enriched for cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) and ATAC-seq peaks. We evaluated the predicted GQ-DNABERT proximal enhancer-promoter (pEP) pairs, using annotations from ENdb, ENCODE, Zoonomia, Chromium multiomics scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq data from normal cells, and cCREs from normal-cancer pairs. We found GQ pEP pairs correlating with gene expression, with some pairings potentially acting as tissue-specific switches. Genes with GQ pEP pairs in cancer cells are enriched in different processes compared to the corresponding normal tissues. Overall, GQ-DNABERT is a valuable tool for extending and harmonizing data collected ex vivo. We demonstrate the usefulness of GQ-DNABERT for investigating transcriptional regulation in single-cell experiments.
31527878	2019	PLoS computational biology	Unified feature association networks through integration of transcriptomic and proteomic data.	High-throughput multi-omics studies and corresponding network analyses of multi-omic data have rapidly expanded their impact over the last 10 years. As biological features of different types (e.g. transcripts, proteins, metabolites) interact within cellular systems, the greatest amount of knowledge can be gained from networks that incorporate multiple types of -omic data. However, biological and technical sources of variation diminish the ability to detect cross-type associations, yielding networks dominated by communities comprised of nodes of the same type. We describe here network building methods that can maximize edges between nodes of different data types leading to integrated networks, networks that have a large number of edges that link nodes of different-omic types (transcripts, proteins, lipids etc). We systematically rank several network inference methods and demonstrate that, in many cases, using a random forest method, GENIE3, produces the most integrated networks. This increase in integration does not come at the cost of accuracy as GENIE3 produces networks of approximately the same quality as the other network inference methods tested here. Using GENIE3, we also infer networks representing antibody-mediated Dengue virus cell invasion and receptor-mediated Dengue virus invasion. A number of functional pathways showed centrality differences between the two networks including genes responding to both GM-CSF and IL-4, which had a higher centrality value in an antibody-mediated vs. receptor-mediated Dengue network. Because a biological system involves the interplay of many different types of molecules, incorporating multiple data types into networks will improve their use as models of biological systems. The methods explored here are some of the first to specifically highlight and address the challenges associated with how such multi-omic networks can be assembled and how the greatest number of interactions can be inferred from different data types. The resulting networks can lead to the discovery of new host response patterns and interactions during viral infection, generate new hypotheses of pathogenic mechanisms and confirm mechanisms of disease.
39471412	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Multimodal contrastive learning for spatial gene expression prediction using histology images.	"In recent years, the advent of spatial transcriptomics (ST) technology has unlocked unprecedented opportunities for delving into the complexities of gene expression patterns within intricate biological systems. Despite its transformative potential, the prohibitive cost of ST technology remains a significant barrier to its widespread adoption in large-scale studies. An alternative, more cost-effective strategy involves employing artificial intelligence to predict gene expression levels using readily accessible whole-slide images stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E). However, existing methods have yet to fully capitalize on multimodal information provided by H&E images and ST data with spatial location. In this paper, we propose mclSTExp, a multimodal contrastive learning with Transformer and Densenet-121 encoder for Spatial Transcriptomics Expression prediction. We conceptualize each spot as a ""word"", integrating its intrinsic features with spatial context through the self-attention mechanism of a Transformer encoder. This integration is further enriched by incorporating image features via contrastive learning, thereby enhancing the predictive capability of our model. We conducted an extensive evaluation of highly variable genes in two breast cancer datasets and a skin squamous cell carcinoma dataset, and the results demonstrate that mclSTExp exhibits superior performance in predicting spatial gene expression. Moreover, mclSTExp has shown promise in interpreting cancer-specific overexpressed genes, elucidating immune-related genes, and identifying specialized spatial domains annotated by pathologists. Our source code is available at https://github.com/shizhiceng/mclSTExp."
40062615	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	A novel integrative multimodal classifier to enhance the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.	Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex, progressive neurodegenerative disorder with high heterogeneity, making early diagnosis difficult. Early detection and intervention are crucial for slowing PD progression. Understanding PD's diverse pathways and mechanisms is key to advancing knowledge. Recent advances in noninvasive imaging and multi-omics technologies have provided valuable insights into PD's underlying causes and biological processes. However, integrating these diverse data sources remains challenging, especially when deriving meaningful low-level features that can serve as diagnostic indicators. This study developed and validated a novel integrative, multimodal predictive model for detecting PD based on features derived from multimodal data, including hematological information, proteomics, RNA sequencing, metabolomics, and dopamine transporter scan imaging, sourced from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. Several model architectures were investigated and evaluated, including support vector machine, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, fully connected neural networks with concatenation and joint modeling (FCNN_C and FCNN_JM), and a multimodal encoder-based model with multi-head cross-attention (MMT_CA). The MMT_CA model demonstrated superior predictive performance, achieving a balanced classification accuracy of 97.7%, thus highlighting its ability to capture and leverage cross-modality inter-dependencies to aid predictive analytics. Furthermore, feature importance analysis using SHapley Additive exPlanations not only identified crucial diagnostic biomarkers to inform the predictive models in this study but also holds potential for future research aimed at integrated functional analyses of PD from a multi-omics perspective, ultimately revealing targets required for precision medicine approaches to aid treatment of PD aimed at slowing down its progression.
34128955	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	A convolutional neural network for common coordinate registration of high-resolution histology images.	MOTIVATION: Registration of histology images from multiple sources is a pressing problem in large-scale studies of spatial -omics data. Researchers often perform 'common coordinate registration', akin to segmentation, in which samples are partitioned based on tissue type to allow for quantitative comparison of similar regions across samples. Accuracy in such registration requires both high image resolution and global awareness, which mark a difficult balancing act for contemporary deep learning architectures. RESULTS: We present a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that combines (i) a local classification CNN that extracts features from image patches sampled sparsely across the tissue surface and (ii) a global segmentation CNN that operates on these extracted features. This hybrid network can be trained in an end-to-end manner, and we demonstrate its relative merits over competing approaches on a reference histology dataset as well as two published spatial transcriptomics datasets. We believe that this paradigm will greatly enhance our ability to process spatial -omics data, and has general purpose applications for the processing of high-resolution histology images on commercially available GPUs. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: All code is publicly available at https://github.com/flatironinstitute/st_gridnet. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
40838787	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	SpaICL: image-guided curriculum strategy-based graph contrastive learning for spatial transcriptomics clustering.	Spatial transcriptomics, by capturing both gene expression and spatial information, holds great promise for unraveling the complex organization of tissues. In this study, we introduce SpaICL, an image-guided curriculum strategy-based graph contrastive learning framework for spatial transcriptomics clustering. SpaICL integrates gene expression, spatial coordinates, and histological image features to construct a low-dimensional latent representation that enhances the de-lineation of spatial functional domains. The model employs a complementary masking strategy and a shared graph neural network encoder to generate dual embeddings, while a dual cross-attention mechanism aligns local and global features across multiple modalities. Additionally, the curriculum learning module further facilitates the gradual integration of neighborhood information, effectively mitigating the over-smoothing issues associated with fixed adjacency matrices. We evaluated the performance of SpaICL on five benchmark spatial transcriptomics datasets, achieving superior results compared to existing baseline methods. Moreover, SpaICL demonstrates significant potential in downstream analytical applications. The code of SpaICL is available at https://github.com/wenwenmin/SpaICL.
39707510	2024	Genome biology	Multi-omics approaches reveal that diffuse midline gliomas present altered DNA replication and are susceptible to replication stress therapy.	BACKGROUND: The fatal diffuse midline gliomas (DMG) are characterized by an undruggable H3K27M mutation in H3.1 or H3.3. K27M impairs normal development by stalling differentiation. The identification of targetable pathways remains very poorly explored. Toward this goal, we undertake a multi-omics approach to evaluate replication timing profiles, transcriptomics, and cell cycle features in DMG cells from both H3.1K27M and H3.3K27M subgroups and perform a comparative, integrative data analysis with healthy brain tissue. RESULTS: DMG cells present differential replication timing in each subgroup, which, in turn, correlates with significant differential gene expression. Differentially expressed genes in S phase are involved in various pathways related to DNA replication. We detect increased expression of DNA replication genes earlier in the cell cycle in DMG cell lines compared to normal brain cells. Furthermore, the distance between origins of replication in DMG cells is smaller than in normal brain cells and their fork speed is slower, a read-out of replication stress. Consistent with these findings, DMG tumors present high replication stress signatures in comparison to normal brain cells. Finally, DMG cells are specifically sensitive to replication stress therapy. CONCLUSIONS: This whole genome multi-omics approach provides insights into the cell cycle regulation of DMG via the H3K27M mutations and establishes a pharmacologic vulnerability in DNA replication, which resolves a potentially novel therapeutic strategy for this non-curable disease.
36243975	2023	Nucleic acids research	SPASCER: spatial transcriptomics annotation at single-cell resolution.	In recent years, the explosive growth of spatial technologies has enabled the characterization of spatial heterogeneity of tissue architectures. Compared to traditional sequencing, spatial transcriptomics reserves the spatial information of each captured location and provides novel insights into diverse spatially related biological contexts. Even though two spatial transcriptomics databases exist, they provide limited analytical information. Information such as spatial heterogeneity of genes and cells, cell-cell communication activities in space, and the cell type compositions in the microenvironment are critical clues to unveil the mechanism of tumorigenesis and embryo differentiation. Therefore, we constructed a new spatial transcriptomics database, named SPASCER (https://ccsm.uth.edu/SPASCER), designed to help understand the heterogeneity of tissue organizations, region-specific microenvironment, and intercellular interactions across tissue architectures at multiple levels. SPASCER contains datasets from 43 studies, including 1082 sub-datasets from 16 organ types across four species. scRNA-seq was integrated to deconvolve/map spatial transcriptomics, and processed with spatial cell-cell interaction, gene pattern and pathway enrichment analysis. Cell-cell interactions and gene regulation network of scRNA-seq from matched spatial transcriptomics were performed as well. The application of SPASCER will provide new insights into tissue architecture and a solid foundation for the mechanistic understanding of many biological processes in healthy and diseased tissues.
22632713	2012	Genome biology	Comparative multi-omics systems analysis of Escherichia coli strains B and K-12.	BACKGROUND: Elucidation of a genotype-phenotype relationship is critical to understand an organism at the whole-system level. Here, we demonstrate that comparative analyses of multi-omics data combined with a computational modeling approach provide a framework for elucidating the phenotypic characteristics of organisms whose genomes are sequenced. RESULTS: We present a comprehensive analysis of genome-wide measurements incorporating multifaceted holistic data - genome, transcriptome, proteome, and phenome - to determine the differences between Escherichia coli B and K-12 strains. A genome-scale metabolic network of E. coli B was reconstructed and used to identify genetic bases of the phenotypes unique to B compared with K-12 through in silico complementation testing. This systems analysis revealed that E. coli B is well-suited for production of recombinant proteins due to a greater capacity for amino acid biosynthesis, fewer proteases, and lack of flagella. Furthermore, E. coli B has an additional type II secretion system and a different cell wall and outer membrane composition predicted to be more favorable for protein secretion. In contrast, E. coli K-12 showed a higher expression of heat shock genes and was less susceptible to certain stress conditions. CONCLUSIONS: This integrative systems approach provides a high-resolution system-wide view and insights into why two closely related strains of E. coli, B and K-12, manifest distinct phenotypes. Therefore, systematic understanding of cellular physiology and metabolism of the strains is essential not only to determine culture conditions but also to design recombinant hosts.
38243703	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Assembling spatial clustering framework for heterogeneous spatial transcriptomics data with GRAPHDeep.	MOTIVATION: Spatial clustering is essential and challenging for spatial transcriptomics' data analysis to unravel tissue microenvironment and biological function. Graph neural networks are promising to address gene expression profiles and spatial location information in spatial transcriptomics to generate latent representations. However, choosing an appropriate graph deep learning module and graph neural network necessitates further exploration and investigation. RESULTS: In this article, we present GRAPHDeep to assemble a spatial clustering framework for heterogeneous spatial transcriptomics data. Through integrating 2 graph deep learning modules and 20 graph neural networks, the most appropriate combination is decided for each dataset. The constructed spatial clustering method is compared with state-of-the-art algorithms to demonstrate its effectiveness and superiority. The significant new findings include: (i) the number of genes or proteins of spatial omics data is quite crucial in spatial clustering algorithms; (ii) the variational graph autoencoder is more suitable for spatial clustering tasks than deep graph infomax module; (iii) UniMP, SAGE, SuperGAT, GATv2, GCN, and TAG are the recommended graph neural networks for spatial clustering tasks; and (iv) the used graph neural network in the existent spatial clustering frameworks is not the best candidate. This study could be regarded as desirable guidance for choosing an appropriate graph neural network for spatial clustering. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code of GRAPHDeep is available at https://github.com/narutoten520/GRAPHDeep. The studied spatial omics data are available at https://zenodo.org/record/8141084.
40662792	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Predicting fine-grained cell types from histology images through cross-modal learning in spatial transcriptomics.	MOTIVATION: Fine-grained cellular characterization provides critical insights into biological processes, including tissue development, disease progression, and treatment responses. The spatial organization of cells and the interactions among distinct cell types play a pivotal role in shaping the tumor micro-environment, driving heterogeneity, and influencing patient prognosis. While computational pathology can uncover morphological structures from tissue images, conventional methods are often restricted to identifying coarse-grained and limited cell types. In contrast, spatial transcriptomics-based approaches hold promise for pinpointing fine-grained transcriptional cell types using histology data. However, these methods tend to overlook key molecular signatures inherent in gene expression data. RESULTS: To this end, we propose a cross-modal unified representation learning framework (CUCA) for identifying fine-grained cell types from histology images. CUCA is trained on paired morphology-molecule spatial transcriptomics data, enabling it to infer fine-grained cell types solely from pathology images. Our model aims to harness the cross-modal embedding alignment paradigm to harmonize the embedding spaces of morphological and molecular modalities, bridging the gap between image patterns and molecular expression signatures. Extensive results across three datasets show that CUCA captures molecule-enhanced cross-modal representations and improves the prediction of fine-grained transcriptional cell abundances. Downstream analyses of cellular spatial architectures and intercellular co-localization reveal that CUCA provides insights into tumor biology, offering potential advancements in cancer research. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code of CUCA is available in Zenodo: 10.5281/zenodo.15087256.
33258948	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	IMIX: a multivariate mixture model approach to association analysis through multi-omics data integration.	MOTIVATION: Integrative genomic analysis is a powerful tool used to study the biological mechanisms underlying a complex disease or trait across multiplatform high-dimensional data, such as DNA methylation, copy number variation and gene expression. It is common to perform large-scale genome-wide association analysis of an outcome for each data type separately and combine the results ad hoc, leading to loss of statistical power and uncontrolled overall false discovery rate (FDR). RESULTS: We propose a multivariate mixture model (IMIX) framework that integrates multiple types of genomic data and allows modeling of inter-data-type correlations. We investigated the across-data-type FDR control in IMIX and demonstrated lower misclassification rates at controlled overall FDR than established individual data type analysis strategies, such as the Benjamini-Hochberg FDR control, the q-value and the local FDR control by extensive simulations. IMIX features statistically principled model selection, FDR control and computational efficiency. Applications to The Cancer Genome Atlas data provided novel multi-omics insights into the genes and mechanisms associated with the luminal and basal subtypes of bladder cancer and the prognosis of pancreatic cancer. AVAILABILITYAND IMPLEMENTATION: We have implemented our method in R package 'IMIX' available at https://github.com/ziqiaow/IMIX, as well as CRAN soon. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
39018178	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Controlled Noise: Evidence of epigenetic regulation of Single-Cell expression variability.	MOTIVATION: Understanding single-cell expression variability (scEV) or gene expression noise among cells of the same type and state is crucial for delineating population-level cellular function. While epigenetic mechanisms are widely implicated in gene expression regulation, a definitive link between chromatin accessibility and scEV remains elusive. Recent advances in single-cell techniques enable the study of single-cell multiomics data that include the simultaneous measurement of scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq within individual cells, presenting an unprecedented opportunity to address this gap. RESULTS: This paper introduces an innovative testing pipeline to investigate the association between chromatin accessibility and scEV. With single-cell multiomics data of scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq, the pipeline hinges on comparing the prediction performance of scATAC-seq data on gene expression levels between highly variable genes (HVGs) and non-highly variable genes (non-HVGs). Applying this pipeline to paired scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq data from human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, we observed a significantly superior prediction performance of scATAC-seq data for HVGs compared to non-HVGs. Notably, there was substantial overlap between well-predicted genes and HVGs. The gene pathways enriched from well-predicted genes are highly pertinent to cell type-specific functions. Our findings support the notion that scEV largely stems from cell-to-cell variability in chromatin accessibility, providing compelling evidence for the epigenetic regulation of scEV and offering promising avenues for investigating gene regulation mechanisms at the single-cell level. AVAILABILITY: The source code and data used in this paper can be found at https://github.com/SiweiCui/EpigeneticControlOfSingle-CellExpressionVariability. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
39880378	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	SSL-VQ: vector-quantized variational autoencoders for semi-supervised prediction of therapeutic targets across diverse diseases.	MOTIVATION: Identifying effective therapeutic targets poses a challenge in drug discovery, especially for uncharacterized diseases without known therapeutic targets (e.g. rare diseases, intractable diseases). RESULTS: This study presents a novel machine learning approach using multimodal vector-quantized variational autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) for predicting therapeutic target molecules across diseases. To address the lack of known therapeutic target-disease associations, we incorporate the information on uncharacterized diseases without known targets or uncharacterized proteins without known indications (applicable diseases) in the semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework. The method integrates disease-specific and protein perturbation profiles with genetic perturbations (e.g. gene knockdowns and gene overexpressions) at the transcriptome level. Cross-cell representation learning, facilitated by VQ-VAEs, was performed to extract informative features from protein perturbation profiles across diverse human cell types. Concurrently, cross-disease representation learning was performed, leveraging VQ-VAE, to extract informative features reflecting disease states from disease-specific profiles. The model's applicability to uncharacterized diseases or proteins is enhanced by considering the consistency between disease-specific and patient-specific signatures. The efficacy of the method is demonstrated across three practical scenarios for 79 diseases: target repositioning for target-disease pairs, new target prediction for uncharacterized diseases, and new indication prediction for uncharacterized proteins. This method is expected to be valuable for identifying therapeutic targets across various diseases. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Code: github.com/YamanishiLab/SSL-VQ and Data: 10.5281/zenodo.14644837.
37037998	2023	Nature methods	Time-resolved assessment of single-cell protein secretion by sequencing.	Secreted proteins play critical roles in cellular communication. Methods enabling concurrent measurement of cellular protein secretion, phenotypes and transcriptomes are still unavailable. Here we describe time-resolved assessment of protein secretion from single cells by sequencing (TRAPS-seq). Released proteins are trapped onto the cell surface and probed by oligonucleotide-barcoded antibodies before being simultaneously sequenced with transcriptomes in single cells. We demonstrate that TRAPS-seq helps unravel the phenotypic and transcriptional determinants of the secretion of pleiotropic T(H)1 cytokines (IFNgamma, IL-2 and TNF) in activated T cells. In addition, we show that TRAPS-seq can be used to track the secretion of multiple cytokines over time, uncovering unique molecular signatures that govern the dynamics of single-cell cytokine secretions. Our results revealed that early central memory T cells with CD45RA expression (T(CMRA)) are important in both the production and maintenance of polyfunctional cytokines. TRAPS-seq presents a unique tool for seamless integration of secretomics measurements with multi-omics profiling in single cells.
32392297	2020	Nucleic acids research	BIOMEX: an interactive workflow for (single cell) omics data interpretation and visualization.	The amount of biological data, generated with (single cell) omics technologies, is rapidly increasing, thereby exacerbating bottlenecks in the data analysis and interpretation of omics experiments. Data mining platforms that facilitate non-bioinformatician experimental scientists to analyze a wide range of experimental designs and data types can alleviate such bottlenecks, aiding in the exploration of (newly generated or publicly available) omics datasets. Here, we present BIOMEX, a browser-based software, designed to facilitate the Biological Interpretation Of Multi-omics EXperiments by bench scientists.

31740819	2019	Nature methods	Fast, sensitive and accurate integration of single-cell data with Harmony.	The emerging diversity of single-cell RNA-seq datasets allows for the full transcriptional characterization of cell types across a wide variety of biological and clinical conditions. However, it is challenging to analyze them together, particularly when datasets are assayed with different technologies, because biological and technical differences are interspersed. We present Harmony (https://github.com/immunogenomics/harmony), an algorithm that projects cells into a shared embedding in which cells group by cell type rather than dataset-specific conditions. Harmony simultaneously accounts for multiple experimental and biological factors. In six analyses, we demonstrate the superior performance of Harmony to previously published algorithms while requiring fewer computational resources. Harmony enables the integration of ~10(6) cells on a personal computer. We apply Harmony to peripheral blood mononuclear cells from datasets with large experimental differences, five studies of pancreatic islet cells, mouse embryogenesis datasets and the integration of scRNA-seq with spatial transcriptomics data.
33219693	2021	Nucleic acids research	AtMAD: Arabidopsis thaliana multi-omics association database.	Integration analysis of multi-omics data provides a comprehensive landscape for understanding biological systems and mechanisms. The abundance of high-quality multi-omics data (genomics, transcriptomics, methylomics and phenomics) for the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana enables scientists to study the genetic mechanism of many biological processes. However, no resource is available to provide comprehensive and systematic multi-omics associations for Arabidopsis. Here, we developed an Arabidopsis thaliana Multi-omics Association Database (AtMAD, http://www.megabionet.org/atmad), a public repository for large-scale measurements of associations between genome, transcriptome, methylome, pathway and phenotype in Arabidopsis, designed for facilitating identification of eQTL, emQTL, Pathway-mQTL, Phenotype-pathway, GWAS, TWAS and EWAS. Candidate variants/methylations/genes were identified in AtMAD for specific phenotypes or biological processes, many of them are supported by experimental evidence. Based on the multi-omics association strategy, we have identified 11 796 cis-eQTLs and 10 119 trans-eQTLs. Among them, 68 837 environment-eQTL associations and 149 622 GWAS-eQTL associations were identified and stored in AtMAD. For expression-methylation quantitative trait loci (emQTL), we identified 265 776 emQTLs and 122 344 pathway-mQTLs. For TWAS and EWAS, we obtained 62 754 significant phenotype-gene associations and 3 993 379 significant phenotype-methylation associations, respectively. Overall, the multi-omics associated network in AtMAD will provide new insights into exploring biological mechanisms of plants at multi-omics levels.
39230702	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Predicting spatially resolved gene expression via tissue morphology using adaptive spatial GNNs.	MOTIVATION: Spatial transcriptomics technologies, which generate a spatial map of gene activity, can deepen the understanding of tissue architecture and its molecular underpinnings in health and disease. However, the high cost makes these technologies difficult to use in practice. Histological images co-registered with targeted tissues are more affordable and routinely generated in many research and clinical studies. Hence, predicting spatial gene expression from the morphological clues embedded in tissue histological images provides a scalable alternative approach to decoding tissue complexity. RESULTS: Here, we present a graph neural network based framework to predict the spatial expression of highly expressed genes from tissue histological images. Extensive experiments on two separate breast cancer data cohorts demonstrate that our method improves the prediction performance compared to the state-of-the-art, and that our model can be used to better delineate spatial domains of biological interest.

36952569	2023	PLoS computational biology	A systematic evaluation of deep learning methods for the prediction of drug synergy in cancer.	One of the main obstacles to the successful treatment of cancer is the phenomenon of drug resistance. A common strategy to overcome resistance is the use of combination therapies. However, the space of possibilities is huge and efficient search strategies are required. Machine Learning (ML) can be a useful tool for the discovery of novel, clinically relevant anti-cancer drug combinations. In particular, deep learning (DL) has become a popular choice for modeling drug combination effects. Here, we set out to examine the impact of different methodological choices on the performance of multimodal DL-based drug synergy prediction methods, including the use of different input data types, preprocessing steps and model architectures. Focusing on the NCI ALMANAC dataset, we found that feature selection based on prior biological knowledge has a positive impact-limiting gene expression data to cancer or drug response-specific genes improved performance. Drug features appeared to be more predictive of drug response, with a 41% increase in coefficient of determination (R2) and 26% increase in Spearman correlation relative to a baseline model that used only cell line and drug identifiers. Molecular fingerprint-based drug representations performed slightly better than learned representations-ECFP4 fingerprints increased R2 by 5.3% and Spearman correlation by 2.8% w.r.t the best learned representations. In general, fully connected feature-encoding subnetworks outperformed other architectures. DL outperformed other ML methods by more than 35% (R2) and 14% (Spearman). Additionally, an ensemble combining the top DL and ML models improved performance by about 6.5% (R2) and 4% (Spearman). Using a state-of-the-art interpretability method, we showed that DL models can learn to associate drug and cell line features with drug response in a biologically meaningful way. The strategies explored in this study will help to improve the development of computational methods for the rational design of effective drug combinations for cancer therapy.
40981505	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	DiSTect: a Bayesian model for disease-associated gene discovery and prediction in spatial transcriptomics.	MOTIVATION: Identifying disease-indicative genes is critical for deciphering disease mechanisms and has attracted significant interest in biomedical research. Spatial transcriptomics offers unprecedented insights for the detection of disease-associated genes by enabling within-tissue contrasts. However, this new technology poses challenges for conventional statistical models developed for RNA-sequencing, as these models often neglect the spatial corrleation of the disease status among tissue spots. RESULTS: In this article, we propose DiSTect, a Bayesian shrinkage model to characterize the relationship between high-dimensional gene expressions and the disease status of each tissue spot, incorporating spatial correlation among these spots through autoregressive terms. Our model adopts a hierarchical structure to facilitate the analysis of multiple correlated samples and is further extended to accommodate the missing data within tissues. To ensure the model's applicability to datasets of varying sizes, we carry out two computational frameworks for Bayesian parameter estimation, tailored to both small and large sample scenarios. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. The proposed model is applied to analyze the data arising from studies of HER2+ breast cancer and Alzheimer's disease. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The dataset and source code are available on GitHub (https://github.com/StaGill/DiSTect) and Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/records/17127211).
30744673	2019	Genome biology	Combined single-cell profiling of expression and DNA methylation reveals splicing regulation and heterogeneity.	BACKGROUND: Alternative splicing is a key regulatory mechanism in eukaryotic cells and increases the effective number of functionally distinct gene products. Using bulk RNA sequencing, splicing variation has been studied across human tissues and in genetically diverse populations. This has identified disease-relevant splicing events, as well as associations between splicing and genomic features, including sequence composition and conservation. However, variability in splicing between single cells from the same tissue or cell type and its determinants remains poorly understood. RESULTS: We applied parallel DNA methylation and transcriptome sequencing to differentiating human induced pluripotent stem cells to characterize splicing variation (exon skipping) and its determinants. Our results show that variation in single-cell splicing can be accurately predicted based on local sequence composition and genomic features. We observe moderate but consistent contributions from local DNA methylation profiles to splicing variation across cells. A combined model that is built based on genomic features as well as DNA methylation information accurately predicts different splicing modes of individual cassette exons. These categories include the conventional inclusion and exclusion patterns, but also more subtle modes of cell-to-cell variation in splicing. Finally, we identified and characterized associations between DNA methylation and splicing changes during cell differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: Our study yields new insights into alternative splicing at the single-cell level and reveals a previously underappreciated link between DNA methylation variation and splicing.
39656774	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Inferring single-cell resolution spatial gene expression via fusing spot-based spatial transcriptomics, location, and histology using GCN.	Spatial transcriptomics (ST technology allows for the detection of cellular transcriptome information while preserving the spatial location of cells. This capability enables researchers to better understand the cellular heterogeneity, spatial organization, and functional interactions in complex biological systems. However, current technological methods are limited by low resolution, which reduces the accuracy of gene expression levels. Here, we propose scstGCN, a multimodal information fusion method based on Vision Transformer and Graph Convolutional Network that integrates histological images, spot-based ST data and spatial location information to infer super-resolution gene expression profiles at single-cell level. We evaluated the accuracy of the super-resolution gene expression profiles generated on diverse tissue ST datasets with disease and healthy by scstGCN along with their performance in identifying spatial patterns, conducting functional enrichment analysis, and tissue annotation. The results show that scstGCN can predict super-resolution gene expression accurately and aid researchers in discovering biologically meaningful differentially expressed genes and pathways. Additionally, scstGCN can segment and annotate tissues at a finer granularity, with results demonstrating strong consistency with coarse manual annotations. Our source code and all used datasets are available at https://github.com/wenwenmin/scstGCN and https://zenodo.org/records/12800375.
41067889	2025	Genome research	Optimal marker genes for c-separated cell types with SepSolve.	The identification of cell types in single-cell RNA-seq studies relies on the distinct expression signature of marker genes. A small set of target genes is also needed to design probes for targeted spatial transcriptomic experiments and to target proteins in single-cell spatial proteomics or for cell sorting. Although traditional approaches have relied on testing one gene at a time for differential expression between a given cell type and the rest, more recent methods have highlighted the benefits of a joint selection of markers that together distinguish all pairs of cell types simultaneously. However, existing methods either consider all pairs of individual cells, which becomes intractable even for medium-sized data sets, or ignore intra-cell-type expression variation entirely by collapsing all cells of a given type to a single representative. Here, we address these limitations and propose to find a small set of genes such that cell types are c-separated in the selected dimensions, a notion introduced previously in learning a mixture of Gaussians. To this end, we formulate a linear program that naturally takes into account expression variation within cell types without including each pair of individual cells in the model, leading to a highly stable set of marker genes that allow to accurately discriminate between cell types and that can be computed to optimality efficiently.
41105750	2025	PLoS computational biology	Spatial domain identification method based on multi-view graph convolutional network and contrastive learning.	Spatial transcriptomics is a rapidly developing field of single-cell genomics that quantitatively measures gene expression while providing spatial information within tissues. A key challenge in spatial transcriptomics is identifying spatially structured domains, which involves analyzing transcriptomic data to find clusters of cells with similar expression patterns and their spatial distribution. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep-learning method called DMGCN for domain identification. The process begins with preprocessing that constructs two types of graphs: a spatial graph based on Euclidean distance and a feature graph based on Cosine distance. These graphs represent spatial positions and gene expressions, respectively. The embeddings of both graphs are generated using a multi-view graph convolutional encoder with an attention mechanism, enabling separate and co-convolution of the graphs, as well as corrupted feature convolution for contrastive learning. Finally, a fully connected network (FCN) decoder is employed to generate domain labels and reconstruct gene expressions for downstream analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that DMGCN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in various tasks, including spatial clustering, trajectory inference, and gene expression broadcasting.

37436699	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Unravelling spatial gene associations with SEAGAL: a Python package for spatial transcriptomics data analysis and visualization.	SUMMARY: In the era where transcriptome profiling moves toward single-cell and spatial resolutions, the traditional co-expression analysis lacks the power to fully utilize such rich information to unravel spatial gene associations. Here, we present a Python package called Spatial Enrichment Analysis of Gene Associations using L-index (SEAGAL) to detect and visualize spatial gene correlations at both single-gene and gene-set levels. Our package takes spatial transcriptomics datasets with gene expression and the aligned spatial coordinates as input. It allows for analyzing and visualizing genes' spatial correlations and cell types' colocalization within the precise spatial context. The output could be visualized as volcano plots and heatmaps with a few lines of code, thus providing an easy-yet-comprehensive tool for mining spatial gene associations. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The Python package SEAGAL can be installed using pip: https://pypi.org/project/seagal/. The source code and step-by-step tutorials are available at: https://github.com/linhuawang/SEAGAL.
40511994	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Gene spatial integration: enhancing spatial transcriptomics analysis via deep learning and batch effect mitigation.	MOTIVATION: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is a groundbreaking technique for studying the correlation between cellular organization within a tissue and its physiological and pathological properties. Every facet of spatial information, including cell/spot proximity, distribution, and dimensionality, is significant. Most methods lean heavily on proximity for ST analysis, each resulting in useful insights but still leaving other aspects untapped. In addition, samples procured at different times, by different donors, and by different technologies introduce a batch effects problem that hinders the statistical approach employed by most analysis tools. Addressing these challenges, we have developed a deep learning method for analyzing integrated multiple ST data, focusing on the distribution aspect. Furthermore, our method aims to leverage single-cell analysis tools. RESULTS: Our study introduces Gene Spatial Integration (GSI), a data integration pipeline utilizing a representation learning approach to extract the spatial distribution of genes into the same feature space as gene expression features. We employ an autoencoder network to extract spatial embedding, facilitating the projection of spatial features into gene expression feature space. Our approach allows for seamless integration of multiple samples with minimum detriment, increasing the performance of the ST data analysis tool. We show the application of our method on the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex dataset. Our method consistently improves the performance of the clustering of Seurat tools, with the most significant increase observed in sample 151673, almost doubling the ARI score from 0.225 to 0.405. We also combine our pipeline with the clustering of GraphST, achieving a significantly higher ARI score in sample 151672 from 0.614 to 0.795. This result reveals the potential of gene distribution spatial aspect, also emphasizes the impact of integration and batch effect removal in developing a refined analysis in understanding tissue characteristics. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Implementation of GSI is accessible at https://github.com/Riandanis/Spatial_Integration_GSI.
40279289	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	TissueViewer: a web-based multiplexed image viewer.	MOTIVATION: Datasets generated by spatial biology techniques such as multiplex immunofluorescence staining or spatial transcriptomics profiling of histologic sections carry a tremendous wealth of information. Several commercial platforms exist that can simultaneously acquire 1-1000 distinct marker signals (e.g. MIBI, CODEX, Orion, Nanostring CosMX SMI, Vizgen). However, due to the large size of these datasets, their viewing and sharing are slow, laborious, and require extensive computational resources. RESULTS: To overcome these challenges, we developed TissueViewer, an easy to setup and use web-based viewer designed to deliver high-resolution images over the internet with low bandwidth requirements and at high speed. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: TissueViewer is available on GitHub (https://github.com/davidvi/tissueviewer) and can be used on the TissueViewer.org platform, where readers can upload their own data with a limit of 50 GB to share with colleagues.
39541189	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	SpaGIC: graph-informed clustering in spatial transcriptomics via self-supervised contrastive learning.	Spatial transcriptomics technologies enable the generation of gene expression profiles while preserving spatial context, providing the potential for in-depth understanding of spatial-specific tissue heterogeneity. Leveraging gene and spatial data effectively is fundamental to accurately identifying spatial domains in spatial transcriptomics analysis. However, many existing methods have not yet fully exploited the local neighborhood details within spatial information. To address this issue, we introduce SpaGIC, a novel graph-based deep learning framework integrating graph convolutional networks and self-supervised contrastive learning techniques. SpaGIC learns meaningful latent embeddings of spots by maximizing both edge-wise and local neighborhood-wise mutual information of graph structures, as well as minimizing the embedding distance between spatially adjacent spots. We evaluated SpaGIC on seven spatial transcriptomics datasets across various technology platforms. The experimental results demonstrated that SpaGIC consistently outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods in several tasks, such as spatial domain identification, data denoising, visualization, and trajectory inference. Additionally, SpaGIC is capable of performing joint analyses of multiple slices, further underscoring its versatility and effectiveness in spatial transcriptomics research.
37930023	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Identifying local associations in biological time series: algorithms, statistical significance, and applications.	Local associations refer to spatial-temporal correlations that emerge from the biological realm, such as time-dependent gene co-expression or seasonal interactions between microbes. One can reveal the intricate dynamics and inherent interactions of biological systems by examining the biological time series data for these associations. To accomplish this goal, local similarity analysis algorithms and statistical methods that facilitate the local alignment of time series and assess the significance of the resulting alignments have been developed. Although these algorithms were initially devised for gene expression analysis from microarrays, they have been adapted and accelerated for multi-omics next generation sequencing datasets, achieving high scientific impact. In this review, we present an overview of the historical developments and recent advances for local similarity analysis algorithms, their statistical properties, and real applications in analyzing biological time series data. The benchmark data and analysis scripts used in this review are freely available at http://github.com/labxscut/lsareview.
40315434	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Deep scSTAR: leveraging deep learning for the extraction and enhancement of phenotype-associated features from single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics data.	Single-cell sequencing has advanced our understanding of cellular heterogeneity and disease pathology, offering insights into cellular behavior and immune mechanisms. However, extracting meaningful phenotype-related features is challenging due to noise, batch effects, and irrelevant biological signals. To address this, we introduce Deep scSTAR (DscSTAR), a deep learning-based tool designed to enhance phenotype-associated features. DscSTAR identified HSP+ FKBP4+ T cells in CD8+ T cells, which linked to immune dysfunction and resistance to immune checkpoint blockade in non-small cell lung cancer. It has also enhanced spatial transcriptomics analysis of renal cell carcinoma, revealing interactions between cancer cells, CD8+ T cells, and tumor-associated macrophages that may promote immune suppression and affect outcomes. In hepatocellular carcinoma, it highlighted the role of S100A12+ neutrophils and cancer-associated fibroblasts in forming tumor immune barriers and potentially contributing to immunotherapy resistance. These findings demonstrate DscSTAR's capacity to model and extract phenotype-specific information, advancing our understanding of disease mechanisms and therapy resistance.
33413550	2021	Genome biology	An integrated multi-omics approach to identify regulatory mechanisms in cancer metastatic processes.	BACKGROUND: Metastatic progress is the primary cause of death in most cancers, yet the regulatory dynamics driving the cellular changes necessary for metastasis remain poorly understood. Multi-omics approaches hold great promise for addressing this challenge; however, current analysis tools have limited capabilities to systematically integrate transcriptomic, epigenomic, and cistromic information to accurately define the regulatory networks critical for metastasis. RESULTS: To address this limitation, we use a purposefully generated cellular model of colon cancer invasiveness to generate multi-omics data, including expression, accessibility, and selected histone modification profiles, for increasing levels of invasiveness. We then adopt a rigorous probabilistic framework for joint inference from the resulting heterogeneous data, along with transcription factor binding profiles. Our approach uses probabilistic graphical models to leverage the functional information provided by specific epigenomic changes, models the influence of multiple transcription factors simultaneously, and automatically learns the activating or repressive roles of cis-regulatory events. Global analysis of these relationships reveals key transcription factors driving invasiveness, as well as their likely target genes. Disrupting the expression of one of the highly ranked transcription factors JunD, an AP-1 complex protein, confirms functional relevance to colon cancer cell migration and invasion. Transcriptomic profiling confirms key regulatory targets of JunD, and a gene signature derived from the model demonstrates strong prognostic potential in TCGA colorectal cancer data. CONCLUSIONS: Our work sheds new light into the complex molecular processes driving colon cancer metastasis and presents a statistically sound integrative approach to analyze multi-omics profiles of a dynamic biological process.
36550277	2023	Nature methods	Efficient combinatorial targeting of RNA transcripts in single cells with Cas13 RNA Perturb-seq.	Pooled CRISPR screens coupled with single-cell RNA-sequencing have enabled systematic interrogation of gene function and regulatory networks. Here, we introduce Cas13 RNA Perturb-seq (CaRPool-seq), which leverages the RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas13d system and enables efficient combinatorial perturbations alongside multimodal single-cell profiling. CaRPool-seq encodes multiple perturbations on a cleavable CRISPR array that is associated with a detectable barcode sequence, allowing for the simultaneous targeting of multiple genes. We compared CaRPool-seq to existing Cas9-based methods, highlighting its unique strength to efficiently profile combinatorially perturbed cells. Finally, we apply CaRPool-seq to perform multiplexed combinatorial perturbations of myeloid differentiation regulators in an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) model system and identify extensive interactions between different chromatin regulators that can enhance or suppress AML differentiation phenotypes.
33627473	2021	Genome research	Linear-time cluster ensembles of large-scale single-cell RNA-seq and multimodal data.	A fundamental task in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) analysis is the identification of transcriptionally distinct groups of cells. Numerous methods have been proposed for this problem, with a recent focus on methods for the cluster analysis of ultralarge scRNA-seq data sets produced by droplet-based sequencing technologies. Most existing methods rely on a sampling step to bridge the gap between algorithm scalability and volume of the data. Ignoring large parts of the data, however, often yields inaccurate groupings of cells and risks overlooking rare cell types. We propose method Specter that adopts and extends recent algorithmic advances in (fast) spectral clustering. In contrast to methods that cluster a (random) subsample of the data, we adopt the idea of landmarks that are used to create a sparse representation of the full data from which a spectral embedding can then be computed in linear time. We exploit Specter's speed in a cluster ensemble scheme that achieves a substantial improvement in accuracy over existing methods and identifies rare cell types with high sensitivity. Its linear-time complexity allows Specter to scale to millions of cells and leads to fast computation times in practice. Furthermore, on CITE-seq data that simultaneously measures gene and protein marker expression, we show that Specter is able to use multimodal omics measurements to resolve subtle transcriptomic differences between subpopulations of cells.
30863842	2019	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Using association signal annotations to boost similarity network fusion.	MOTIVATION: Recent technology developments have made it possible to generate various kinds of omics data, which provides opportunities to better solve problems such as disease subtyping or disease mapping using more comprehensive omics data jointly. Among many developed data-integration methods, the similarity network fusion (SNF) method has shown a great potential to identify new disease subtypes through separating similar subjects using multi-omics data. SNF effectively fuses similarity networks with pairwise patient similarity measures from different types of omics data into one fused network using both shared and complementary information across multiple types of omics data. RESULTS: In this article, we proposed an association-signal-annotation boosted similarity network fusion (ab-SNF) method, adding feature-level association signal annotations as weights aiming to up-weight signal features and down-weight noise features when constructing subject similarity networks to boost the performance in disease subtyping. In various simulation studies, the proposed ab-SNF outperforms the original SNF approach without weights. Most importantly, the improvement in the subtyping performance due to association-signal-annotation weights is amplified in the integration process. Applications to somatic mutation data, DNA methylation data and gene expression data of three cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas project suggest that the proposed ab-SNF method consistently identifies new subtypes in each cancer that more accurately predict patient survival and are more biologically meaningful. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The R package abSNF is freely available for downloading from https://github.com/pfruan/abSNF. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
41243953	2025	Nucleic acids research	Mapping drug mechanisms with ProteomicsDB: unified omics and cell sensitivity data at scale.	Proteomic and phenotypic cell sensitivity datasets are increasingly important for understanding chemoproteomics and the underlying drug mechanisms of action. Yet, integrating such heterogeneous datasets remains challenging due to inconsistent annotations, incompatible IDs, and variable data processing methods. Here, a major update to ProteomicsDB (https://www.proteomicsdb.org) is presented that combines over 1300 proteomic and 1000 transcriptomic profiles with phenotypic cell sensitivity data across >1500 human cancer cell lines and 1470 drugs. Harmonizing cell line and drug names and applying a standardized normalization and refitting pipeline for dose-response curves enables consistent, statistically robust analysis across studies. Three new graphical user interfaces support interactive exploration of cell sensitivity data, exploring the protein targets and dose-resolved changes in protein expression in the presence of a drug, and comparing the expression profiles of cell lines. With this update, ProteomicsDB is strengthening its future role as a central hub for proteomics and multi-omics, providing researchers with a unified framework to explore phenotypic cell sensitivity in combination with dose-resolved expression proteomics at the molecular level, supporting biomarker discovery, drug repurposing, and precision medicine applications.
40713795	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Spatial mutual nearest neighbors for spatial transcriptomics data.	MOTIVATION: Mutual nearest neighbors (MNN) is a widely used computational tool to perform batch correction for single-cell RNA-sequencing data. However, in applications such as spatial transcriptomics, it fails to take into account the 2D spatial information. RESULTS: Here, we present spatialMNN, an algorithm that integrates multiple spatial transcriptomic samples and identifies spatial domains. Our approach begins by building a k-nearest neighbors (kNN) graph based on the spatial coordinates, prunes noisy edges, and identifies niches to act as anchor points for each sample. Next, we construct a MNN graph across the samples to identify similar niches. Finally, the spatialMNN graph can be partitioned using existing algorithms, such as the Louvain algorithm to predict spatial domains across the tissue samples. We demonstrate the performance of spatialMNN using large datasets, including one with N = 31 10x Genomics Visium samples. We also evaluate the computing performance of spatialMNN to other popular spatial clustering methods. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Our software package is available on GitHub (https://github.com/Pixel-Dream/spatialMNN). The code is available on Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15073963).
32759226	2020	Genome research	Diploid genome architecture revealed by multi-omic data of hybrid mice.	Although mammalian genomes are diploid, previous studies extensively investigated the average chromatin architectures without considering the differences between homologous chromosomes. We generated Hi-C, ChIP-seq, and RNA-seq data sets from CD4 T cells of B6, Cast, and hybrid mice, to investigate the diploid chromatin organization and epigenetic regulation. Our data indicate that inter-chromosomal interaction patterns between homologous chromosomes are similar, and the similarity is highly correlated with their allelic coexpression levels. Reconstruction of the 3D nucleus revealed that distances of the homologous chromosomes to the center of nucleus are almost the same. The inter-chromosomal interactions at centromere ends are significantly weaker than those at telomere ends, suggesting that they are located in different regions within the chromosome territories. The majority of A|B compartments or topologically associated domains (TADs) are consistent between B6 and Cast. We found 58% of the haploids in hybrids maintain their parental compartment status at B6/Cast divergent compartments owing to cis effect. About 95% of the trans-effected B6/Cast divergent compartments converge to the same compartment status potentially because of a shared cellular environment. We showed the differentially expressed genes between the two haploids in hybrid were associated with either genetic or epigenetic effects. In summary, our multi-omics data from the hybrid mice provided haploid-specific information on the 3D nuclear architecture and a rich resource for further understanding the epigenetic regulation of haploid-specific gene expression.
37198601	2023	Genome biology	Celloscope: a probabilistic model for marker-gene-driven cell type deconvolution in spatial transcriptomics data.	Spatial transcriptomics maps gene expression across tissues, posing the challenge of determining the spatial arrangement of different cell types. However, spatial transcriptomics spots contain multiple cells. Therefore, the observed signal comes from mixtures of cells of different types. Here, we propose an innovative probabilistic model, Celloscope, that utilizes established prior knowledge on marker genes for cell type deconvolution from spatial transcriptomics data. Celloscope outperforms other methods on simulated data, successfully indicates known brain structures and spatially distinguishes between inhibitory and excitatory neuron types based in mouse brain tissue, and dissects large heterogeneity of immune infiltrate composition in prostate gland tissue.
39754206	2025	Genome biology	SMORE: spatial motifs reveal patterns in cellular architecture of complex tissues.	Deciphering the link between tissue architecture and function requires methods to identify and interpret patterns in spatial arrangement of cells. We present SMORE, an approach to detect patterns in sequential arrangements of cells and examine their associated gene expression specializations. Applied to retina, brain, and embryonic tissue maps, SMORE identifies novel spatial motifs, including one that offers a new mechanism of action for type 1b bipolar cells. Structural signatures detected by SMORE also form a basis for classifying tissues. Together, our method provides a new framework for uncovering spatial complexity in tissue organization and offers novel insights into tissue function.
33423051	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	CNA2Subpathway: identification of dysregulated subpathway driven by copy number alterations in cancer.	Biological pathways reflect the key cellular mechanisms that dictate disease states, drug response and altered cellular function. The local areas of pathways are defined as subpathways (SPs), whose dysfunction has been reported to be associated with the occurrence and development of cancer. With the development of high-throughput sequencing technology, identifying dysfunctional SPs by using multi-omics data has become possible. Moreover, the SPs are not isolated in the biological system but interact with each other. Here, we propose a network-based calculated method, CNA2Subpathway, to identify dysfunctional SPs is driven by somatic copy number alterations (CNAs) in cancer through integrating pathway topology information, multi-omics data and SP crosstalk. This provides a novel way of SP analysis by using the SP interactions in the system biological level. Using data sets from breast cancer and head and neck cancer, we validate the effectiveness of CNA2Subpathway in identifying cancer-relevant SPs driven by the somatic CNAs, which are also shown to be associated with cancer immune and prognosis of patients. We further compare our results with five pathway or SP analysis methods based on CNA and gene expression data without considering SP crosstalk. With these analyses, we show that CNA2Subpathway could help to uncover dysfunctional SPs underlying cancer via the use of SP crosstalk. CNA2Subpathway is developed as an R-based tool, which is freely available on GitHub (https://github.com/hanjunwei-lab/CNA2Subpathway).
33408400	2021	Nature methods	Multiomics sequencing goes spatial.	Microfluidic channels provide a means to deliver barcodes encoding spatial information to a tissue, which allows co-profiling of gene expression and proteins of interest in a spatially resolved manner.
31175825	2019	Nucleic acids research	Learning common and specific patterns from data of multiple interrelated biological scenarios with matrix factorization.	High-throughput biological technologies (e.g. ChIP-seq, RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq) rapidly accelerate the accumulation of genome-wide omics data in diverse interrelated biological scenarios (e.g. cells, tissues and conditions). Integration and differential analysis are two common paradigms for exploring and analyzing such data. However, current integrative methods usually ignore the differential part, and typical differential analysis methods either fail to identify combinatorial patterns of difference or require matched dimensions of the data. Here, we propose a flexible framework CSMF to combine them into one paradigm to simultaneously reveal Common and Specific patterns via Matrix Factorization from data generated under interrelated biological scenarios. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CSMF with four representative applications including pairwise ChIP-seq data describing the chromatin modification map between K562 and Huvec cell lines; pairwise RNA-seq data representing the expression profiles of two different cancers; RNA-seq data of three breast cancer subtypes; and single-cell RNA-seq data of human embryonic stem cell differentiation at six time points. Extensive analysis yields novel insights into hidden combinatorial patterns in these multi-modal data. Results demonstrate that CSMF is a powerful tool to uncover common and specific patterns with significant biological implications from data of interrelated biological scenarios.
39494524	2025	Nucleic acids research	scImmOmics: a manually curated resource of single-cell multi-omics immune data.	Single-cell sequencing technology has enabled the discovery and characterization of subpopulations of immune cells with unique functions, which is critical for revealing immune responses under healthy or disease conditions. Efforts have been made to collect and curate single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, yet an immune-specific single-cell multi-omics atlas with harmonized metadata is still lacking. Here, we present scImmOmics (https://bio.liclab.net/scImmOmics/home), a manually curated single-cell multi-omics immune database constructed based on high-quality immune cells with known immune cell labels. Currently, scImmOmics documents >2.9 million cell-type labeled immune cells derived from seven single-cell sequencing technologies, involving 131 immune cell types, 47 tissues and 4 species. To ensure data consistency, we standardized the nomenclature of immune cell types and presented them in a hierarchical tree structure to clearly describe the lineage relationships within the immune system. scImmOmics also provides comprehensive immune regulatory information, including T-cell/B-cell receptor sequencing clonotype information, cell-specific regulatory information (e.g. gene/chromatin accessibility/protein/transcription factor states within known cell types, cell-to-cell communication and co-expression networks) and immune cell responses to cytokines. Collectively, scImmOmics is a comprehensive and valuable platform for unraveling the heterogeneity and diversity of immune cells and elucidating the specific regulatory mechanisms at the single-cell level.
38940155	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	REUNION: transcription factor binding prediction and regulatory association inference from single-cell multi-omics data.	"MOTIVATION: Profiling of gene expression and chromatin accessibility by single-cell multi-omics approaches can help to systematically decipher how transcription factors (TFs) regulate target gene expression via cis-region interactions. However, integrating information from different modalities to discover regulatory associations is challenging, in part because motif scanning approaches miss many likely TF binding sites. RESULTS: We develop REUNION, a framework for predicting genome-wide TF binding and cis-region-TF-gene ""triplet"" regulatory associations using single-cell multi-omics data. The first component of REUNION, Unify, utilizes information theory-inspired complementary score functions that incorporate TF expression, chromatin accessibility, and target gene expression to identify regulatory associations. The second component, Rediscover, takes Unify estimates as input for pseudo semi-supervised learning to predict TF binding in accessible genomic regions that may or may not include detected TF motifs. Rediscover leverages latent chromatin accessibility and sequence feature spaces of the genomic regions, without requiring chromatin immunoprecipitation data for model training. Applied to peripheral blood mononuclear cell data, REUNION outperforms alternative methods in TF binding prediction on average performance. In particular, it recovers missing region-TF associations from regions lacking detected motifs, which circumvents the reliance on motif scanning and facilitates discovery of novel associations involving potential co-binding transcriptional regulators. Newly identified region-TF associations, even in regions lacking a detected motif, improve the prediction of target gene expression in regulatory triplets, and are thus likely to genuinely participate in the regulation. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: All source code is available at https://github.com/yangymargaret/REUNION."
36243962	2023	Nucleic acids research	RABC: Rheumatoid Arthritis Bioinformatics Center.	Advances in sequencing technologies have led to the rapid growth of multi-omics data on rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, a comprehensive database that systematically collects and classifies the scattered data is still lacking. Here, we developed the Rheumatoid Arthritis Bioinformatics Center (RABC, http://www.onethird-lab.com/RABC/), the first multi-omics data resource platform (data hub) for RA. There are four categories of data in RABC: (i) 175 multi-omics sample sets covering transcriptome, epigenome, genome, and proteome; (ii) 175 209 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), 105 differentially expressed microRNAs (DEMs), 18 464 differentially DNA methylated (DNAm) genes, 1 764 KEGG pathways, 30 488 GO terms, 74 334 SNPs, 242 779 eQTLs, 105 m6A-SNPs and 18 491 669 meta-mQTLs; (iii) prior knowledge on seven types of RA molecular markers from nine public and credible databases; (iv) 127 073 literature information from PubMed (from 1972 to March 2022). RABC provides a user-friendly interface for browsing, searching and downloading these data. In addition, a visualization module also supports users to generate graphs of analysis results by inputting personalized parameters. We believe that RABC will become a valuable resource and make a significant contribution to the study of RA.
39764614	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	STMGraph: spatial-context-aware of transcriptomes via a dual-remasked dynamic graph attention model.	Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies enable dissecting the tissue architecture in spatial context. To perceive the global contextual information of gene expression patterns in tissue, the spatial dependence of cells must be fully considered by integrating both local and non-local features by means of spatial-context-aware. However, the current ST integration algorithm ignores for ST dropouts, which impedes the spatial-aware of ST features, resulting in challenges in the accuracy and robustness of microenvironmental heterogeneity detecting, spatial domain clustering, and batch-effects correction. Here, we developed an STMGraph, a universal dual-view dynamic deep learning framework that combines dual-remask (MASK-REMASK) with dynamic graph attention model (DGAT) to exploit ST data outperforming pre-existing tools. The dual-remask mechanism masks the embeddings before encoding and decoding, establishing dual-decoding-view to share features mutually. DGAT leverages self-supervision to update graph linkage relationships from two distinct perspectives, thereby generating a comprehensive representation for each node. Systematic benchmarking against 10 state-of-the-art tools revealed that the STMGraph has the optimal performance with high accuracy and robustness on spatial domain clustering for the datasets of diverse ST platforms from multi- to sub-cellular resolutions. Furthermore, STMGraph aggregates ST information cross regions by dual-remask to realize the batch-effects correction implicitly, allowing for spatial domain clustering of ST multi-slices. STMGraph is platform independent and superior in spatial-context-aware to achieve microenvironmental heterogeneity detection, spatial domain clustering, batch-effects correction, and new biological discovery, and is therefore a desirable novel tool for diverse ST studies.
39367648	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	An initial game-theoretic assessment of enhanced tissue preparation and imaging protocols for improved deep learning inference of spatial transcriptomics from tissue morphology.	The application of deep learning to spatial transcriptomics (ST) can reveal relationships between gene expression and tissue architecture. Prior work has demonstrated that inferring gene expression from tissue histomorphology can discern these spatial molecular markers to enable population scale studies, reducing the fiscal barriers associated with large-scale spatial profiling. However, while most improvements in algorithmic performance have focused on improving model architectures, little is known about how the quality of tissue preparation and imaging can affect deep learning model training for spatial inference from morphology and its potential for widespread clinical adoption. Prior studies for ST inference from histology typically utilize manually stained frozen sections with imaging on non-clinical grade scanners. Training such models on ST cohorts is also costly. We hypothesize that adopting tissue processing and imaging practices that mirror standards for clinical implementation (permanent sections, automated tissue staining, and clinical grade scanning) can significantly improve model performance. An enhanced specimen processing and imaging protocol was developed for deep learning-based ST inference from morphology. This protocol featured the Visium CytAssist assay to permit automated hematoxylin and eosin staining (e.g. Leica Bond), 40x-resolution imaging, and joining of multiple patients' tissue sections per capture area prior to ST profiling. Using a cohort of 13 pathologic T Stage-III stage colorectal cancer patients, we compared the performance of models trained on slide prepared using enhanced versus traditional (i.e. manual staining and low-resolution imaging) protocols. Leveraging Inceptionv3 neural networks, we predicted gene expression across serial, histologically-matched tissue sections using whole slide images (WSI) from both protocols. The data Shapley was used to quantify and compare marginal performance gains on a patient-by-patient basis attributed to using the enhanced protocol versus the actual costs of spatial profiling. Findings indicate that training and validating on WSI acquired through the enhanced protocol as opposed to the traditional method resulted in improved performance at lower fiscal cost. In the realm of ST, the enhancement of deep learning architectures frequently captures the spotlight; however, the significance of specimen processing and imaging is often understated. This research, informed through a game-theoretic lens, underscores the substantial impact that specimen preparation/imaging can have on spatial transcriptomic inference from morphology. It is essential to integrate such optimized processing protocols to facilitate the identification of prognostic markers at a larger scale.
37410704	2023	PLoS computational biology	Ten quick tips for avoiding pitfalls in multi-omics data integration analyses.	Data are the most important elements of bioinformatics: Computational analysis of bioinformatics data, in fact, can help researchers infer new knowledge about biology, chemistry, biophysics, and sometimes even medicine, influencing treatments and therapies for patients. Bioinformatics and high-throughput biological data coming from different sources can even be more helpful, because each of these different data chunks can provide alternative, complementary information about a specific biological phenomenon, similar to multiple photos of the same subject taken from different angles. In this context, the integration of bioinformatics and high-throughput biological data gets a pivotal role in running a successful bioinformatics study. In the last decades, data originating from proteomics, metabolomics, metagenomics, phenomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomics have been labelled -omics data, as a unique name to refer to them, and the integration of these omics data has gained importance in all biological areas. Even if this omics data integration is useful and relevant, due to its heterogeneity, it is not uncommon to make mistakes during the integration phases. We therefore decided to present these ten quick tips to perform an omics data integration correctly, avoiding common mistakes we experienced or noticed in published studies in the past. Even if we designed our ten guidelines for beginners, by using a simple language that (we hope) can be understood by anyone, we believe our ten recommendations should be taken into account by all the bioinformaticians performing omics data integration, including experts.
37016448	2023	Genome biology	Asymmetric gene expression and cell-type-specific regulatory networks in the root of bread wheat revealed by single-cell multiomics analysis.	BACKGROUND: Homoeologs are defined as homologous genes resulting from allopolyploidy. Bread wheat, Triticum aestivum, is an allohexaploid species with many homoeologs. Homoeolog expression bias, referring to the relative contribution of homoeologs to the transcriptome, is critical for determining the traits that influence wheat growth and development. Asymmetric transcription of homoeologs has been so far investigated in a tissue or organ-specific manner, which could be misleading due to a mixture of cell types. RESULTS: Here, we perform single nuclei RNA sequencing and ATAC sequencing of wheat root to study the asymmetric gene transcription, reconstruct cell differentiation trajectories and cell-type-specific gene regulatory networks. We identify 22 cell types. We then reconstruct cell differentiation trajectories that suggest different origins between epidermis/cortex and endodermis, distinguishing bread wheat from Arabidopsis. We show that the ratio of asymmetrically transcribed triads varies greatly when analyzing at the single-cell level. Hub transcription factors determining cell type identity are also identified. In particular, we demonstrate that TaSPL14 participates in vasculature development by regulating the expression of BAM1. Combining single-cell transcription and chromatin accessibility data, we construct the pseudo-time regulatory network driving root hair differentiation. We find MYB3R4, REF6, HDG1, and GATAs as key regulators in this process. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal the transcriptional landscape of root organization and asymmetric gene transcription at single-cell resolution in polyploid wheat.
39152991	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	SpatialOne: end-to-end analysis of visium data at scale.	MOTIVATION: Spatial transcriptomics allow to quantify mRNA expression within the spatial context. Nonetheless, in-depth analysis of spatial transcriptomics data remains challenging and difficult to scale due to the number of methods and libraries required for that purpose. RESULTS: Here we present SpatialOne, an end-to-end pipeline designed to simplify the analysis of 10x Visium data by combining multiple state-of-the-art computational methods to segment, deconvolve, and quantify spatial information; this approach streamlines the analysis of reproducible spatial-data at scale. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: SpatialOne source code and execution examples are available at https://github.com/Sanofi-Public/spatialone-pipeline, experimental data is available at https://zenodo.org/records/12605154. SpatialOne is distributed as a docker container image.
41163196	2025	Genome biology	Systematic discovery of subcellular RNA patterns in the gut epithelium.	BACKGROUND: Subcellular RNA localization is crucial for the spatio-temporal control of protein synthesis and underlies key processes during development, homeostasis, and disease. In epithelial cells, RNA can localize asymmetrically along the apico-basal axis. Yet, the localization of most transcripts as well as the diversity of patterns that they adopt remains unexplored. RESULTS: Here, we use APEX-seq for proximity labeling and MERFISH for spatial transcriptomics to map subcellular transcript localization in intestinal organoids and tissue from adult mice. Many transcripts present localization bias, often localizing in granular structures. We uncover intrinsic and environmental factors that influence the formation of these patterns. Additionally, we identify translation-dependent and -independent localization patterns and pinpoint the role of 3' untranslated regions and RNA-binding proteins. CONCLUSIONS: This subcellular RNA atlas presents a detailed resource for understanding intestinal physiology.
40074951	2025	Nature methods	Spotiphy enables single-cell spatial whole transcriptomics across an entire section.	Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has advanced our understanding of tissue regionalization by enabling the visualization of gene expression within whole-tissue sections, but current approaches remain plagued by the challenge of achieving single-cell resolution without sacrificing whole-genome coverage. Here we present Spotiphy (spot imager with pseudo-single-cell-resolution histology), a computational toolkit that transforms sequencing-based ST data into single-cell-resolved whole-transcriptome images. Spotiphy delivers the most precise cellular proportions in extensive benchmarking evaluations. Spotiphy-derived inferred single-cell profiles reveal astrocyte and disease-associated microglia regional specifications in Alzheimer's disease and healthy mouse brains. Spotiphy identifies multiple spatial domains and alterations in tumor-tumor microenvironment interactions in human breast ST data. Spotiphy bridges the information gap and enables visualization of cell localization and transcriptomic profiles throughout entire sections, offering highly informative outputs and an innovative spatial analysis pipeline for exploring complex biological systems.
39376034	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	MultiSC: a deep learning pipeline for analyzing multiomics single-cell data.	Single-cell technologies enable researchers to investigate cell functions at an individual cell level and study cellular processes with higher resolution. Several multi-omics single-cell sequencing techniques have been developed to explore various aspects of cellular behavior. Using NEAT-seq as an example, this method simultaneously obtains three kinds of omics data for each cell: gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and protein expression of transcription factors (TFs). Consequently, NEAT-seq offers a more comprehensive understanding of cellular activities in multiple modalities. However, there is a lack of tools available for effectively integrating the three types of omics data. To address this gap, we propose a novel pipeline called MultiSC for the analysis of MULTIomic Single-Cell data. Our pipeline leverages a multimodal constraint autoencoder (single-cell hierarchical constraint autoencoder) to integrate the multi-omics data during the clustering process and a matrix factorization-based model (scMF) to predict target genes regulated by a TF. Moreover, we utilize multivariate linear regression models to predict gene regulatory networks from the multi-omics data. Additional functionalities, including differential expression, mediation analysis, and causal inference, are also incorporated into the MultiSC pipeline. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of MultiSC. The results demonstrate that our pipeline enables researchers to gain a comprehensive view of cell activities and gene regulatory networks by fully leveraging the potential of multiomics single-cell data. By employing MultiSC, researchers can effectively integrate and analyze diverse omics data types, enhancing their understanding of cellular processes.
41206131	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Decoding cell fate: integrated experimental and computational analysis at the single-cell level.	MOTIVATION: Understanding cell fate determination is crucial in developmental biology and regenerative medicine. Although theoretical frameworks such as epigenetic landscape and gene regulatory networks have been proposed for decades, traditional studies have often been limited by population-averaging and low-throughput techniques, which obscure the heterogeneity of individual cells and fail to provide a systematic view of cell fate control. Recent advances in single-cell technologies have provided unprecedented resolution, revealing the complexity of cell fate decisions and driving the need for more sophisticated computational methods. RESULTS: In this review, we first emphasize experimental advances, such as single-cell multi-omics, lineage tracing, and perturbation techniques, which produce novel data modalities and enable dynamic tracking of cell fate transitions. We then discuss the modeling paradigms for cell fate studies and further assess the role of emerging AI tools in perturbation modeling and discuss the potential of single-cell and spatial foundation models. Additionally, we highlight several case studies on predicting and manipulating cell fates, and discuss key challenges and future directions of the field. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: This work generates no new software.
36280724	2022	Nature methods	ClampFISH 2.0 enables rapid, scalable amplified RNA detection in situ.	RNA labeling in situ has enormous potential to visualize transcripts and quantify their levels in single cells, but it remains challenging to produce high levels of signal while also enabling multiplexed detection of multiple RNA species simultaneously. Here, we describe clampFISH 2.0, a method that uses an inverted padlock design to efficiently detect many RNA species and exponentially amplify their signals at once, while also reducing the time and cost compared with the prior clampFISH method. We leverage the increased throughput afforded by multiplexed signal amplification and sequential detection to detect 10 different RNA species in more than 1 million cells. We also show that clampFISH 2.0 works in tissue sections. We expect that the advantages offered by clampFISH 2.0 will enable many applications in spatial transcriptomics.
38783067	2024	Nature methods	Dependency-aware deep generative models for multitasking analysis of spatial omics data.	Spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) technologies have significantly advanced biomedical research, but their data analysis remains challenging due to the discrete nature of the data and the high levels of noise, compounded by complex spatial dependencies. Here, we propose spaVAE, a dependency-aware, deep generative spatial variational autoencoder model that probabilistically characterizes count data while capturing spatial correlations. spaVAE introduces a hybrid embedding combining a Gaussian process prior with a Gaussian prior to explicitly capture spatial correlations among spots. It then optimizes the parameters of deep neural networks to approximate the distributions underlying the SRT data. With the approximated distributions, spaVAE can contribute to several analytical tasks that are essential for SRT data analysis, including dimensionality reduction, visualization, clustering, batch integration, denoising, differential expression, spatial interpolation, resolution enhancement and identification of spatially variable genes. Moreover, we have extended spaVAE to spaPeakVAE and spaMultiVAE to characterize spatial ATAC-seq (assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing) data and spatial multi-omics data, respectively.
34929734	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	Deep learning tackles single-cell analysis-a survey of deep learning for scRNA-seq analysis.	Since its selection as the method of the year in 2013, single-cell technologies have become mature enough to provide answers to complex research questions. With the growth of single-cell profiling technologies, there has also been a significant increase in data collected from single-cell profilings, resulting in computational challenges to process these massive and complicated datasets. To address these challenges, deep learning (DL) is positioned as a competitive alternative for single-cell analyses besides the traditional machine learning approaches. Here, we survey a total of 25 DL algorithms and their applicability for a specific step in the single cell RNA-seq processing pipeline. Specifically, we establish a unified mathematical representation of variational autoencoder, autoencoder, generative adversarial network and supervised DL models, compare the training strategies and loss functions for these models, and relate the loss functions of these models to specific objectives of the data processing step. Such a presentation will allow readers to choose suitable algorithms for their particular objective at each step in the pipeline. We envision that this survey will serve as an important information portal for learning the application of DL for scRNA-seq analysis and inspire innovative uses of DL to address a broader range of new challenges in emerging multi-omics and spatial single-cell sequencing.
33303016	2020	Genome biology	GCNG: graph convolutional networks for inferring gene interaction from spatial transcriptomics data.	Most methods for inferring gene-gene interactions from expression data focus on intracellular interactions. The availability of high-throughput spatial expression data opens the door to methods that can infer such interactions both within and between cells. To achieve this, we developed Graph Convolutional Neural networks for Genes (GCNG). GCNG encodes the spatial information as a graph and combines it with expression data using supervised training. GCNG improves upon prior methods used to analyze spatial transcriptomics data and can propose novel pairs of extracellular interacting genes. The output of GCNG can also be used for downstream analysis including functional gene assignment.Supporting website with software and data: https://github.com/xiaoyeye/GCNG .
34718748	2022	Nucleic acids research	MVIP: multi-omics portal of viral infection.	Virus infections are huge threats to living organisms and cause many diseases, such as COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, which has led to millions of deaths. To develop effective strategies to control viral infection, we need to understand its molecular events in host cells. Virus related functional genomic datasets are growing rapidly, however, an integrative platform for systematically investigating host responses to viruses is missing. Here, we developed a user-friendly multi-omics portal of viral infection named as MVIP (https://mvip.whu.edu.cn/). We manually collected available high-throughput sequencing data under viral infection, and unified their detailed metadata including virus, host species, infection time, assay, and target, etc. We processed multi-layered omics data of more than 4900 viral infected samples from 77 viruses and 33 host species with standard pipelines, including RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and CLIP-seq, etc. In addition, we integrated these genome-wide signals into customized genome browsers, and developed multiple dynamic charts to exhibit the information, such as time-course dynamic and differential gene expression profiles, alternative splicing changes and enriched GO/KEGG terms. Furthermore, we implemented several tools for efficiently mining the virus-host interactions by virus, host and genes. MVIP would help users to retrieve large-scale functional information and promote the understanding of virus-host interactions.
38436557	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Innovative super-resolution in spatial transcriptomics: a transformer model exploiting histology images and spatial gene expression.	Spatial transcriptomics technologies have shed light on the complexities of tissue structures by accurately mapping spatial microenvironments. Nonetheless, a myriad of methods, especially those utilized in platforms like Visium, often relinquish spatial details owing to intrinsic resolution limitations. In response, we introduce TransformerST, an innovative, unsupervised model anchored in the Transformer architecture, which operates independently of references, thereby ensuring cost-efficiency by circumventing the need for single-cell RNA sequencing. TransformerST not only elevates Visium data from a multicellular level to a single-cell granularity but also showcases adaptability across diverse spatial transcriptomics platforms. By employing a vision transformer-based encoder, it discerns latent image-gene expression co-representations and is further enhanced by spatial correlations, derived from an adaptive graph Transformer module. The sophisticated cross-scale graph network, utilized in super-resolution, significantly boosts the model's accuracy, unveiling complex structure-functional relationships within histology images. Empirical evaluations validate its adeptness in revealing tissue subtleties at the single-cell scale. Crucially, TransformerST adeptly navigates through image-gene co-representation, maximizing the synergistic utility of gene expression and histology images, thereby emerging as a pioneering tool in spatial transcriptomics. It not only enhances resolution to a single-cell level but also introduces a novel approach that optimally utilizes histology images alongside gene expression, providing a refined lens for investigating spatial transcriptomics.
41171708	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	STEAM: Spatial Transcriptomics Evaluation Algorithm and Metric for clustering performance.	Spatial transcriptomic technologies allow researchers to explore the diversity and specificity of gene expression within an original tissue structure. Accurately identifying regions that are spatially coherent in both gene expression and physical tissue structures is an emerging topic; however, it is challenging because of the lack of ground truth labels which complicates the validation of clustering consistency and reproducibility. This highlights a need for a computational evaluation framework to rigorously and unbiasedly assess the clustering performance. To address this gap, we propose Spatial Transcriptomics Evaluation Algorithm and Metric (STEAM), a user-friendly computational pipeline to evaluate the consistency and reliability of clustering results by leveraging machine learning classification and prediction methods, with the goal of maintaining spatial proximity and gene expression patterns within clusters. In addition, it enables iterative correction of misclassified cells, providing actionable guidance for cluster refinement. We benchmarked STEAM on various public datasets, spanning multicell to single-cell resolution, normal and diseased tissues, as well as spatial transcriptomics and proteomics. The results highlighted its robustness and generalizability through comprehensive statistical evaluation metrics, such as Kappa score, F1 score, accuracy, adjusted rand index, normalized mutual information, and percentage of abnormal spots. Notably, STEAM supports multisample training, enabling cross-replicate clustering consistency assessments. Moreover, STEAM provides practical guidance by comparing clustering results across multiple approaches; here, we evaluated four representative methods encompassing both spatial-aware and spatial-ignorant strategies. In summary, STEAM is a promising tool for evaluating clustering robustness and benchmarking clustering performance for spatial omics data, offering valuable insights to drive reproducible discoveries in spatial biology.
35213535	2022	PLoS computational biology	Mapping the gene network landscape of Alzheimer's disease through integrating genomics and transcriptomics.	Integration of multi-omics data with molecular interaction networks enables elucidation of the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using the latest genome-wide association studies (GWAS) including proxy cases and the STRING interactome, we identified an AD network of 142 risk genes and 646 network-proximal genes, many of which were linked to synaptic functions annotated by mouse knockout data. The proximal genes were confirmed to be enriched in a replication GWAS of autopsy-documented cases. By integrating the AD gene network with transcriptomic data of AD and healthy temporal cortices, we identified 17 gene clusters of pathways, such as up-regulated complement activation and lipid metabolism, down-regulated cholinergic activity, and dysregulated RNA metabolism and proteostasis. The relationships among these pathways were further organized by a hierarchy of the AD network pinpointing major parent nodes in graph structure including endocytosis and immune reaction. Control analyses were performed using transcriptomics from cerebellum and a brain-specific interactome. Further integration with cell-specific RNA sequencing data demonstrated genes in our clusters of immunoregulation and complement activation were highly expressed in microglia.

37224539	2023	Nucleic acids research	STellaris: a web server for accurate spatial mapping of single cells based on spatial transcriptomics data.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides insights into gene expression heterogeneities in diverse cell types underlying homeostasis, development and pathological states. However, the loss of spatial information hinders its applications in deciphering spatially related features, such as cell-cell interactions in a spatial context. Here, we present STellaris (https://spatial.rhesusbase.com), a web server aimed to rapidly assign spatial information to scRNA-seq data based on their transcriptomic similarity with public spatial transcriptomics (ST) data. STellaris is founded on 101 manually curated ST datasets comprising 823 sections across different organs, developmental stages and pathological states from humans and mice. STellaris accepts raw count matrix and cell type annotation of scRNA-seq data as the input, and maps single cells to spatial locations in the tissue architecture of properly matched ST section. Spatially resolved information for intercellular communications, such as spatial distance and ligand-receptor interactions (LRIs), are further characterized between annotated cell types. Moreover, we also expanded the application of STellaris in spatial annotation of multiple regulatory levels with single-cell multiomics data, using the transcriptome as a bridge. STellaris was applied to several case studies to showcase its utility of adding value to the ever-growing scRNA-seq data from a spatial perspective.
36781228	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Identifying spatial domain by adapting transcriptomics with histology through contrastive learning.	Recent advances in spatial transcriptomics have enabled measurements of gene expression at cell/spot resolution meanwhile retaining both the spatial information and the histology images of the tissues. Accurately identifying the spatial domains of spots is a vital step for various downstream tasks in spatial transcriptomics analysis. To remove noises in gene expression, several methods have been developed to combine histopathological images for data analysis of spatial transcriptomics. However, these methods either use the image only for the spatial relations for spots, or individually learn the embeddings of the gene expression and image without fully coupling the information. Here, we propose a novel method ConGI to accurately exploit spatial domains by adapting gene expression with histopathological images through contrastive learning. Specifically, we designed three contrastive loss functions within and between two modalities (the gene expression and image data) to learn the common representations. The learned representations are then used to cluster the spatial domains on both tumor and normal spatial transcriptomics datasets. ConGI was shown to outperform existing methods for the spatial domain identification. In addition, the learned representations have also been shown powerful for various downstream tasks, including trajectory inference, clustering, and visualization.
32014031	2020	Genome biology	scAI: an unsupervised approach for the integrative analysis of parallel single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles.	Simultaneous measurements of transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles in the same individual cells provide an unprecedented opportunity to understand cell fates. However, effective approaches for the integrative analysis of such data are lacking. Here, we present a single-cell aggregation and integration (scAI) method to deconvolute cellular heterogeneity from parallel transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles. Through iterative learning, scAI aggregates sparse epigenomic signals in similar cells learned in an unsupervised manner, allowing coherent fusion with transcriptomic measurements. Simulation studies and applications to three real datasets demonstrate its capability of dissecting cellular heterogeneity within both transcriptomic and epigenomic layers and understanding transcriptional regulatory mechanisms.
34763716	2021	Genome biology	Comprehensive characterization of single-cell full-length isoforms in human and mouse with long-read sequencing.	A modified Chromium 10x droplet-based protocol that subsamples cells for both short-read and long-read (nanopore) sequencing together with a new computational pipeline (FLAMES) is developed to enable isoform discovery, splicing analysis, and mutation detection in single cells. We identify thousands of unannotated isoforms and find conserved functional modules that are enriched for alternative transcript usage in different cell types and species, including ribosome biogenesis and mRNA splicing. Analysis at the transcript level allows data integration with scATAC-seq on individual promoters, improved correlation with protein expression data, and linked mutations known to confer drug resistance to transcriptome heterogeneity.
41325417	2025	PLoS computational biology	Integrative multi-omics framework for causal gene discovery in long COVID.	Long COVID, or Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), affects an estimated 10-20% of patients and presents persistent multisystemic symptoms. Although demographic and clinical factors, such as age, sex, and comorbidities, contribute to risk, the genetic mechanisms underlying this risk remain poorly defined. To address this gap, we developed a multi-omics framework that integrates Transcriptome-Wide Mendelian Randomization (TWMR), Control Theory (CT), Expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL), Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network to identify putative causal genes and network drivers in Long COVID. Our approach prioritized 32 candidate genes, including 19 previously reported and 13 novel, with roles in the SARS-CoV-2 response, viral carcinogenesis, immune regulation, and cell cycle control. Enrichment analyses revealed a shared genetic architecture in syndromic, metabolic, autoimmune, and connective tissue disorders. Using causal gene expression profiles, we identified three distinct symptom-based subtypes of Long COVID, providing information on the heterogeneity of disease mechanisms and clinical presentation. Finally, we developed an open-source Shiny application for interactive exploration of these findings. Together, this integrative framework highlights novel causal mechanisms and therapeutic targets, advancing precision medicine strategies for Long COVID.
25378332	2014	Nucleic acids research	Aberrant transcriptional regulations in cancers: genome, transcriptome and epigenome analysis of lung adenocarcinoma cell lines.	Here we conducted an integrative multi-omics analysis to understand how cancers harbor various types of aberrations at the genomic, epigenomic and transcriptional levels. In order to elucidate biological relevance of the aberrations and their mutual relations, we performed whole-genome sequencing, RNA-Seq, bisulfite sequencing and ChIP-Seq of 26 lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. The collected multi-omics data allowed us to associate an average of 536 coding mutations and 13,573 mutations in promoter or enhancer regions with aberrant transcriptional regulations. We detected the 385 splice site mutations and 552 chromosomal rearrangements, representative cases of which were validated to cause aberrant transcripts. Averages of 61, 217, 3687 and 3112 mutations are located in the regulatory regions which showed differential DNA methylation, H3K4me3, H3K4me1 and H3K27ac marks, respectively. We detected distinct patterns of aberrations in transcriptional regulations depending on genes. We found that the irregular histone marks were characteristic to EGFR and CDKN1A, while a large genomic deletion and hyper-DNA methylation were most frequent for CDKN2A. We also used the multi-omics data to classify the cell lines regarding their hallmarks of carcinogenesis. Our datasets should provide a valuable foundation for biological interpretations of interlaced genomic and epigenomic aberrations.
40369670	2025	Genome biology	New insights into the cold tolerance of upland switchgrass by integrating a haplotype-resolved genome and multi-omics analysis.	"BACKGROUND: Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a bioenergy and forage crop. Upland switchgrass exhibits superior cold tolerance compared to the lowland ecotype, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. RESULTS: Here, we present a high-quality haplotype-resolved genome of the upland ecotype ""Jingji31."" We then conduct multi-omics analysis to explore the mechanism underlying its cold tolerance. By comparative transcriptome analysis of the upland and lowland ecotypes, we identify many genes with ecotype-specific differential expression, particularly members of the cold-responsive (COR) gene family, under cold stress. Notably, AFB1, ATL80, HOS10, and STRS2 gene families show opposite expression changes between the two ecotypes. Based on the haplotype-resolved genome of ""Jingji31,"" we detect more cold-induced allele-specific expression genes in the upland ecotype than in the lowland ecotype, and these genes are significantly enriched in the COR gene family. By genome-wide association study, we detect an association signal related to the overwintering rate, which overlaps with a selective sweep region containing a cytochrome P450 gene highly expressed under cold stress. Heterologous overexpression of this gene in rice alleviates leaf chlorosis and wilting under cold stress. We also verify that expression of this gene is suppressed by a structural variation in the promoter region. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the high-quality haplotype-resolved genome and multi-omics analysis of upland switchgrass, we characterize candidate genes responsible for cold tolerance. This study advances our understanding of plant cold tolerance, which provides crop breeding for improved cold tolerance."
34020548	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	Towards multi-omics characterization of tumor heterogeneity: a comprehensive review of statistical and machine learning approaches.	The multi-omics molecular characterization of cancer opened a new horizon for our understanding of cancer biology and therapeutic strategies. However, a tumor biopsy comprises diverse types of cells limited not only to cancerous cells but also to tumor microenvironmental cells and adjacent normal cells. This heterogeneity is a major confounding factor that hampers a robust and reproducible bioinformatic analysis for biomarker identification using multi-omics profiles. Besides, the heterogeneity itself has been recognized over the years for its significant prognostic values in some cancer types, thus offering another promising avenue for therapeutic intervention. A number of computational approaches to unravel such heterogeneity from high-throughput molecular profiles of a tumor sample have been proposed, but most of them rely on the data from an individual omics layer. Since the heterogeneity of cells is widely distributed across multi-omics layers, methods based on an individual layer can only partially characterize the heterogeneous admixture of cells. To help facilitate further development of the methodologies that synchronously account for several multi-omics profiles, we wrote a comprehensive review of diverse approaches to characterize tumor heterogeneity based on three different omics layers: genome, epigenome and transcriptome. As a result, this review can be useful for the analysis of multi-omics profiles produced by many large-scale consortia. Contact:sunkim.bioinfo@snu.ac.kr.
40598307	2025	Genome biology	Automated integration of multi-slice spatial transcriptomics data in 2D and 3D using VR-Omics.	The field of spatial transcriptomics is rapidly evolving, with increasing sample complexity, resolution, and tissue size. Yet the field lacks comprehensive and intuitive solutions for automated integration and analysis of multi-slice data in either co-planar (2D) or stacked (3D) formation. To address this, we develop VR-Omics, a free, platform-agnostic software that provides end-to-end automated processing of multi-slice data through a biologist-friendly interface. Benchmarking against existing methods demonstrates VR-Omics' unique strengths to perform comprehensive end-to-end analysis of multi-slice stacked data. Through co-planar slice analysis, VR-Omics uncovers previously undetected, dysregulated metabolic networks within rare pediatric cardiac rhabdomyomas, demonstrating its potential for biological discoveries.
39051702	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	SpatialQC: automated quality control for spatial transcriptome data.	SUMMARY: The advent of spatial transcriptomics has revolutionized our understanding of the spatial heterogeneity in tissues, providing unprecedented insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying biological processes. Although quality control (QC) critical for downstream data analyses, there is currently a lack of specialized tools for one-stop spatial transcriptome QC. Here, we introduce SpatialQC, a one-stop QC pipeline, which generates comprehensive QC reports and produces clean data in an interactive fashion. SpatialQC is widely applicable to spatial transcriptomic techniques. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: source code and user manuals are available via https://github.com/mgy520/spatialQC, and deposited on Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12634669).
35027729	2022	Nature biotechnology	Cell2location maps fine-grained cell types in spatial transcriptomics.	Spatial transcriptomic technologies promise to resolve cellular wiring diagrams of tissues in health and disease, but comprehensive mapping of cell types in situ remains a challenge. Here we present small es, Cyrillicell2location, a Bayesian model that can resolve fine-grained cell types in spatial transcriptomic data and create comprehensive cellular maps of diverse tissues. Cell2location accounts for technical sources of variation and borrows statistical strength across locations, thereby enabling the integration of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics with higher sensitivity and resolution than existing tools. We assessed cell2location in three different tissues and show improved mapping of fine-grained cell types. In the mouse brain, we discovered fine regional astrocyte subtypes across the thalamus and hypothalamus. In the human lymph node, we spatially mapped a rare pre-germinal center B cell population. In the human gut, we resolved fine immune cell populations in lymphoid follicles. Collectively, our results present small es, Cyrillicell2location as a versatile analysis tool for mapping tissue architectures in a comprehensive manner.
41250217	2025	Genome biology	Phased epigenomics and methylation inheritance in a historical Vitis vinifera hybrid.	BACKGROUND: Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, regulate transcription and influence key biological traits. While many efforts were made to understand their stability in annual crops, their long-term persistence in clonally propagated plants remains poorly understood. Grapevine (Vitis vinifera) provides a unique model, with cultivars vegetatively propagated for centuries. RESULTS: Here, we assemble the phased genomes of Cabernet Sauvignon and its parental lineages, Cabernet Franc and Sauvignon Blanc, using HiFi long-reads and a gene map tenfold denser than existing maps. Using three clones per cultivar, we quantify methylation with very consistent short- and long-read sequencing and ensure both varietal representativeness and assessment of clonal variability. We leverage the parent-progeny sequence graph to highlight allele-specific methylation and conserved transcriptomic patterns for genes and small RNA. Such a format is essential to integrate multi-omics data and reveals that, despite less clonal conservation than genetic polymorphisms, methylation marks are remarkably inherited. By further demonstrating the linear-reference limitations, we determine that the correct representation of genetic variants by the sequence graph is crucial for the accurate allelic quantification of the methylome. CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal the remarkable stability of epigenetic marks in a model propagated by asexual reproduction. Using a phased sequence graph, we introduce a scalable framework that accounts for genomic variation, accurately quantifies allele-specific methylation, and supports multi-omics integration such as our evaluation of the transcriptional impact of epigenetic inheritance. This approach has broad implications for perennial crops, where epigenetic variation could influence traits relevant to breeding, adaptation, and long-term agricultural sustainability.
39562752	2025	Nature methods	Repurposing large-format microarrays for scalable spatial transcriptomics.	Spatiomolecular analyses are key to study tissue functions and malfunctions. However, we lack profiling tools for spatial transcriptomics that are easy to adopt, low cost and scalable in terms of sample size and number. Here, we describe a method, Array-seq, to repurpose classical oligonucleotide microarrays for spatial transcriptomics profiling. We generate Array-seq slides from microarrays carrying custom-design probes that contain common sequences flanking unique barcodes at known coordinates. Then we perform a simple, two-step reaction that produces mRNA capture probes across all spots on the microarray. We demonstrate that Array-seq yields spatial transcriptomes with high detection sensitivity and localization specificity using histological sections from mouse tissues as test systems. Moreover, we show that the large surface area of Array-seq slides yields spatial transcriptomes (i) at high throughput by profiling multi-organ sections, (ii) in three dimensions by processing serial sections from one sample, and (iii) across whole human organs. Thus, by combining classical DNA microarrays and next-generation sequencing, we have created a simple and flexible platform for spatiomolecular studies of small-to-large specimens at scale.
37310927	2023	Genome research	Simultaneous profiling of host expression and microbial abundance by spatial metatranscriptome sequencing.	We developed an analysis pipeline that can extract microbial sequences from spatial transcriptomic (ST) data and assign taxonomic labels, generating a spatial microbial abundance matrix in addition to the default host expression matrix, enabling simultaneous analysis of host expression and microbial distribution. We called the pipeline spatial metatranscriptome (SMT) and applied it on both human and murine intestinal sections and validated the spatial microbial abundance information with alternative assays. Biological insights were gained from these novel data that showed host-microbe interaction at various spatial scales. Finally, we tested experimental modification that can increase microbial capture while preserving host spatial expression quality and, by use of positive controls, quantitatively showed the capture efficiency and recall of our methods. This proof-of-concept work shows the feasibility of SMT analysis and paves the way for further experimental optimization and application.
34191792	2021	PLoS computational biology	Mixture-of-Experts Variational Autoencoder for clustering and generating from similarity-based representations on single cell data.	Clustering high-dimensional data, such as images or biological measurements, is a long-standing problem and has been studied extensively. Recently, Deep Clustering has gained popularity due to its flexibility in fitting the specific peculiarities of complex data. Here we introduce the Mixture-of-Experts Similarity Variational Autoencoder (MoE-Sim-VAE), a novel generative clustering model. The model can learn multi-modal distributions of high-dimensional data and use these to generate realistic data with high efficacy and efficiency. MoE-Sim-VAE is based on a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), where the decoder consists of a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. This specific architecture allows for various modes of the data to be automatically learned by means of the experts. Additionally, we encourage the lower dimensional latent representation of our model to follow a Gaussian mixture distribution and to accurately represent the similarities between the data points. We assess the performance of our model on the MNIST benchmark data set and challenging real-world tasks of clustering mouse organs from single-cell RNA-sequencing measurements and defining cell subpopulations from mass cytometry (CyTOF) measurements on hundreds of different datasets. MoE-Sim-VAE exhibits superior clustering performance on all these tasks in comparison to the baselines as well as competitor methods.
36094338	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	MODIG: integrating multi-omics and multi-dimensional gene network for cancer driver gene identification based on graph attention network model.	MOTIVATION: Identifying genes that play a causal role in cancer evolution remains one of the biggest challenges in cancer biology. With the accumulation of high-throughput multi-omics data over decades, it becomes a great challenge to effectively integrate these data into the identification of cancer driver genes. RESULTS: Here, we propose MODIG, a graph attention network (GAT)-based framework to identify cancer driver genes by combining multi-omics pan-cancer data (mutations, copy number variants, gene expression and methylation levels) with multi-dimensional gene networks. First, we established diverse types of gene relationship maps based on protein-protein interactions, gene sequence similarity, KEGG pathway co-occurrence, gene co-expression patterns and gene ontology. Then, we constructed a multi-dimensional gene network consisting of approximately 20 000 genes as nodes and five types of gene associations as multiplex edges. We applied a GAT to model within-dimension interactions to generate a gene representation for each dimension based on this graph. Moreover, we introduced a joint learning module to fuse multiple dimension-specific representations to generate general gene representations. Finally, we used the obtained gene representation to perform a semi-supervised driver gene identification task. The experiment results show that MODIG outperforms the baseline models in terms of area under precision-recall curves and area under the receiver operating characteristic curves. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The MODIG program is available at https://github.com/zjupgx/modig. The code and data underlying this article are also available on Zenodo, at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7057241.

36879006	2023	Nature biotechnology	Microfluidics-free single-cell genomics with templated emulsification.	Current single-cell RNA-sequencing approaches have limitations that stem from the microfluidic devices or fluid handling steps required for sample processing. We develop a method that does not require specialized microfluidic devices, expertise or hardware. Our approach is based on particle-templated emulsification, which allows single-cell encapsulation and barcoding of cDNA in uniform droplet emulsions with only a vortexer. Particle-templated instant partition sequencing (PIP-seq) accommodates a wide range of emulsification formats, including microwell plates and large-volume conical tubes, enabling thousands of samples or millions of cells to be processed in minutes. We demonstrate that PIP-seq produces high-purity transcriptomes in mouse-human mixing studies, is compatible with multiomics measurements and can accurately characterize cell types in human breast tissue compared to a commercial microfluidic platform. Single-cell transcriptional profiling of mixed phenotype acute leukemia using PIP-seq reveals the emergence of heterogeneity within chemotherapy-resistant cell subsets that were hidden by standard immunophenotyping. PIP-seq is a simple, flexible and scalable next-generation workflow that extends single-cell sequencing to new applications.

RESULTS: Following Occam's razor, we show that a simple PCA-based algorithm for unsupervised spatial domain identification rivals the performance of ten competing state-of-the-art methods across six single-cell spatial transcriptomic datasets. Our reductionist approach, NichePCA, provides researchers with intuitive domain interpretation and excels in execution speed, robustness, and scalability.

39578628	2025	Nature methods	CelloType: a unified model for segmentation and classification of tissue images.	Cell segmentation and classification are critical tasks in spatial omics data analysis. Here we introduce CelloType, an end-to-end model designed for cell segmentation and classification for image-based spatial omics data. Unlike the traditional two-stage approach of segmentation followed by classification, CelloType adopts a multitask learning strategy that integrates these tasks, simultaneously enhancing the performance of both. CelloType leverages transformer-based deep learning techniques for improved accuracy in object detection, segmentation and classification. It outperforms existing segmentation methods on a variety of multiplexed fluorescence and spatial transcriptomic images. In terms of cell type classification, CelloType surpasses a model composed of state-of-the-art methods for individual tasks and a high-performance instance segmentation model. Using multiplexed tissue images, we further demonstrate the utility of CelloType for multiscale segmentation and classification of both cellular and noncellular elements in a tissue. The enhanced accuracy and multitask learning ability of CelloType facilitate automated annotation of rapidly growing spatial omics data.
41139313	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Spatial transcriptomics: a bibliometric analysis with large language model on English literatures.	"Spatial transcriptomics (ST) integrates spatial data with transcriptomic information, providing high-resolution maps of gene expression within tissue contexts. It has revolutionized studies on cellular function and disease mechanisms, particularly in cancer and immunology. We conducted a bibliometric analysis of 1197 publications from the Web of Science (2015-24), focusing on publication trends, journal distribution, and keyword analysis to identify key research areas in ST. ST publications surged from 2021, with 500 papers in 2023. Five of the top 10 journals are from the Nature Publishing Group. Keyword analysis identified emerging trends like ""tumor microenvironment,"" ""immune infiltration,"" and ""biomarker,"" highlighting ST's expanding role in cancer and immunology. International collaboration among multidisciplinary teams is crucial for maximizing ST's potential, and understanding its trends will guide its future impact. Large language models can further enrich the results of bibliometric research, making the findings of bibliometrics more comprehensive and specific."

38343327	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Genomic hallmarks and therapeutic targets of ribosome biogenesis in cancer.	Hyperactive ribosome biogenesis (RiboSis) fuels unrestricted cell proliferation, whereas genomic hallmarks and therapeutic targets of RiboSis in cancers remain elusive, and efficient approaches to quantify RiboSis activity are still limited. Here, we have established an in silico approach to conveniently score RiboSis activity based on individual transcriptome data. By employing this novel approach and RNA-seq data of 14 645 samples from TCGA/GTEx dataset and 917 294 single-cell expression profiles across 13 cancer types, we observed the elevated activity of RiboSis in malignant cells of various human cancers, and high risk of severe outcomes in patients with high RiboSis activity. Our mining of pan-cancer multi-omics data characterized numerous molecular alterations of RiboSis, and unveiled the predominant somatic alteration in RiboSis genes was copy number variation. A total of 128 RiboSis genes, including EXOSC4, BOP1, RPLP0P6 and UTP23, were identified as potential therapeutic targets. Interestingly, we observed that the activity of RiboSis was associated with TP53 mutations, and hyperactive RiboSis was associated with poor outcomes in lung cancer patients without TP53 mutations, highlighting the importance of considering TP53 mutations during therapy by impairing RiboSis. Moreover, we predicted 23 compounds, including methotrexate and CX-5461, associated with the expression signature of RiboSis genes. The current study generates a comprehensive blueprint of molecular alterations in RiboSis genes across cancers, which provides a valuable resource for RiboSis-based anti-tumor therapy.
33051654	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	MOSAIC: a joint modeling methodology for combined circadian and non-circadian analysis of multi-omics data.	MOTIVATION: Circadian rhythms are approximately 24-h endogenous cycles that control many biological functions. To identify these rhythms, biological samples are taken over circadian time and analyzed using a single omics type, such as transcriptomics or proteomics. By comparing data from these single omics approaches, it has been shown that transcriptional rhythms are not necessarily conserved at the protein level, implying extensive circadian post-transcriptional regulation. However, as proteomics methods are known to be noisier than transcriptomic methods, this suggests that previously identified arrhythmic proteins with rhythmic transcripts could have been missed due to noise and may not be due to post-transcriptional regulation. RESULTS: To determine if one can use information from less-noisy transcriptomic data to inform rhythms in more-noisy proteomic data, and thus more accurately identify rhythms in the proteome, we have created the Multi-Omics Selection with Amplitude Independent Criteria (MOSAIC) application. MOSAIC combines model selection and joint modeling of multiple omics types to recover significant circadian and non-circadian trends. Using both synthetic data and proteomic data from Neurospora crassa, we showed that MOSAIC accurately recovers circadian rhythms at higher rates in not only the proteome but the transcriptome as well, outperforming existing methods for rhythm identification. In addition, by quantifying non-circadian trends in addition to circadian trends in data, our methodology allowed for the recognition of the diversity of circadian regulation as compared to non-circadian regulation. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: MOSAIC's full interface is available at https://github.com/delosh653/MOSAIC. An R package for this functionality, mosaic.find, can be downloaded at https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mosaic.find.

38385877	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	BiGATAE: a bipartite graph attention auto-encoder enhancing spatial domain identification from single-slice to multi-slices.	Recent advancements in spatial transcriptomics technology have revolutionized our ability to comprehensively characterize gene expression patterns within the tissue microenvironment, enabling us to grasp their functional significance in a spatial context. One key field of research in spatial transcriptomics is the identification of spatial domains, which refers to distinct regions within the tissue where specific gene expression patterns are observed. Diverse methodologies have been proposed, each with its unique characteristics. As the availability of spatial transcriptomics data continues to expand, there is a growing need for methods that can integrate information from multiple slices to discover spatial domains. To extend the applicability of existing single-slice analysis methods to multi-slice clustering, we introduce BiGATAE (Bipartite Graph Attention Auto Encoder) that leverages gene expression information from adjacent tissue slices to enhance spatial transcriptomics data. BiGATAE comprises two steps: aligning slices to generate an adjacency matrix for different spots in consecutive slices and constructing a bipartite graph. Subsequently, it utilizes a graph attention network to integrate information across different slices. Then it can seamlessly integrate with pre-existing techniques. To evaluate the performance of BiGATAE, we conducted benchmarking analyses on three different datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that for existing single-slice clustering methods, the integration of BiGATAE significantly enhances their performance. Moreover, single-slice clustering methods integrated with BiGATAE outperform methods specifically designed for multi-slice integration. These results underscore the proficiency of BiGATAE in facilitating information transfer across multiple slices and its capacity to broaden the applicability and sustainability of pre-existing methods.
34429148	2021	Genome biology	Acute depletion of CTCF rewires genome-wide chromatin accessibility.	BACKGROUND: The transcription factor CTCF appears indispensable in defining topologically associated domain boundaries and maintaining chromatin loop structures within these domains, supported by numerous functional studies. However, acute depletion of CTCF globally reduces chromatin interactions but does not significantly alter transcription. RESULTS: Here, we systematically integrate multi-omics data including ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, WGBS, Hi-C, Cut&Run, and CRISPR-Cas9 survival dropout screens, and time-solved deep proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses in cells carrying auxin-induced degron at endogenous CTCF locus. Acute CTCF protein degradation markedly rewires genome-wide chromatin accessibility. Increased accessible chromatin regions are frequently located adjacent to CTCF-binding sites at promoter regions and insulator sites associated with enhanced transcription of nearby genes. In addition, we use CTCF-associated multi-omics data to establish a combinatorial data analysis pipeline to discover CTCF co-regulatory partners. We successfully identify 40 candidates, including multiple established partners. Interestingly, many CTCF co-regulators that have alterations of their respective downstream gene expression do not show changes of their own expression levels across the multi-omics measurements upon acute CTCF loss, highlighting the strength of our system to discover hidden co-regulatory partners associated with CTCF-mediated transcription. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights that CTCF loss rewires genome-wide chromatin accessibility, which plays a critical role in transcriptional regulation.
40457480	2025	Genome biology	mNSF: multi-sample non-negative spatial factorization.	Analyzing multi-sample spatial transcriptomics data requires accounting for biological variation. We present multi-sample non-negative spatial factorization (mNSF), an alignment-free framework extending single-sample spatial factorization to multi-sample datasets. mNSF incorporates sample-specific spatial correlation modeling and extracts low-dimensional data representations. Through simulations and real data analysis, we demonstrate mNSF's efficacy in identifying true factors, shared anatomical regions, and region-specific biological functions. mNSF's performance is comparable to alignment-based methods when alignment is feasible, while enabling analysis in scenarios where spatial alignment is unfeasible. mNSF shows promise as a robust method for analyzing spatially resolved transcriptomics data across multiple samples.
26787660	2016	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Multi-omics enrichment analysis using the GeneTrail2 web service.	MOTIVATION: Gene set analysis has revolutionized the interpretation of high-throughput transcriptomic data. Nowadays, with comprehensive studies that measure multiple -omics from the same sample, powerful tools for the integrative analysis of multi-omics datasets are required. RESULTS: Here, we present GeneTrail2, a web service allowing the integrated analysis of transcriptomic, miRNomic, genomic and proteomic datasets. It offers multiple statistical tests, a large number of predefined reference sets, as well as a comprehensive collection of biological categories and enables direct comparisons between the computed results. We used GeneTrail2 to explore pathogenic mechanisms of Wilms tumors. We not only succeeded in revealing signaling cascades that may contribute to the malignancy of blastemal subtype tumors but also identified potential biomarkers for nephroblastoma with adverse prognosis. The presented use-case demonstrates that GeneTrail2 is well equipped for the integrative analysis of comprehensive -omics data and may help to shed light on complex pathogenic mechanisms in cancer and other diseases.

31114869	2019	Nucleic acids research	MEXPRESS update 2019.	The recent growth in the number of publicly available cancer omics databases has been accompanied by the development of various tools that allow researchers to visually explore these data. In 2015, we built MEXPRESS, an online tool for the integration and visualization of gene expression, DNA methylation and clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), a large collection of publicly available multi-omics cancer data. MEXPRESS addresses the need for an easy-to-use, interactive application that allows researchers to identify dysregulated genes and their clinical relevance in cancer. Furthermore, while other tools typically do not support integrated visualization of expression and DNA methylation data in combination with the precise genomic location of the methylation, MEXPRESS is unique in how it depicts these diverse data types together. Motivated by the large number of users MEXPRESS has managed to attract over the past 3 years and the recent migration of all TCGA data to a new data portal, we developed a new version of MEXPRESS (https://mexpress.be). It contains the latest TCGA data, additional types of omics and clinical data and extra functionality, allowing users to explore mechanisms of gene dysregulation beyond expression and DNA methylation.
39567235	2024	Genome research	Understanding isoform expression by pairing long-read sequencing with single-cell and spatial transcriptomics.	RNA isoform diversity, produced via alternative splicing, and alternative usage of transcription start and poly(A) sites, results in varied transcripts being derived from the same gene. Distinct isoforms can play important biological roles, including by changing the sequences or expression levels of protein products. The first single-cell approaches to RNA sequencing-and later, spatial approaches-which are now widely used for the identification of differentially expressed genes, rely on short reads and offer the ability to transcriptomically compare different cell types but are limited in their ability to measure differential isoform expression. More recently, long-read sequencing methods have been combined with single-cell and spatial technologies in order to characterize isoform expression. In this review, we provide an overview of the emergence of single-cell and spatial long-read sequencing and discuss the challenges associated with the implementation of these technologies and interpretation of these data. We discuss the opportunities they offer for understanding the relationships between the distinct variable elements of transcript molecules and highlight some of the ways in which they have been used to characterize isoforms' roles in development and pathology. Single-nucleus long-read sequencing, a special case of the single-cell approach, is also discussed. We attempt to cover both the limitations of these technologies and their significant potential for expanding our still-limited understanding of the biological roles of RNA isoforms.

41066694	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Heterogeneous graph contrastive learning for integration and alignment of spatial transcriptomics data.	Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technology enables the simultaneous capture of gene expression profile and spatial information within 2D tissue slices. However, conventional analyses that process each individual slice independently often overlook shared features across multiple slices, limiting comprehensive biological insights. To address this, we introduce GRASS, a deep graph representation learning-based framework designed for the integration and alignment of multislice ST data. GRASS consists of two core modules: GRASS_Integration, which employs a heterogeneous graph architecture integrating contrastive learning and a multi-expert collaboration strategy to fully utilize both shared and unique information, enabling multislice integration, clustering, and various downstream analyses; and GRASS_Alignment, which uses a dual-perception similarity metric to guide spot-level alignment, supporting downstream tasks such as imputation and 3D reconstruction. Experimental results on seven ST datasets from five different platforms demonstrate that GRASS consistently outperforms eight state-of-the-art methods in both integration and alignment tasks. By comprehensively addressing multi-level information integration, GRASS emerges as an ideal solution for the joint analysis of multislice ST data.
36264977	2022	PLoS computational biology	Global and gene-specific translational regulation in Escherichia coli across different conditions.	How well mRNA transcript levels represent protein abundances has been a controversial issue. Particularly across different environments, correlations between mRNA and protein exhibit remarkable variability from gene to gene. Translational regulation is likely to be one of the key factors contributing to mismatches between mRNA level and protein abundance in bacteria. Here, we quantified genome-wide transcriptome and relative translation efficiency (RTE) under 12 different conditions in Escherichia coli. By quantifying the mRNA-RTE correlation both across genes and across conditions, we uncovered a diversity of gene-specific translational regulations, cooperating with transcriptional regulations, in response to carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphate (P) limitations. Intriguingly, we found that many genes regulating translation are themselves subject to translational regulation, suggesting possible feedbacks. Furthermore, a random forest model suggests that codon usage partially predicts a gene's cross-condition variability in translation efficiency; such cross-condition variability tends to be an inherent quality of a gene, independent of the specific nutrient limitations. These findings broaden the understanding of translational regulation under different environments and provide novel strategies for the control of translation in synthetic biology. In addition, our data offers a resource for future multi-omics studies.
40971965	2025	PLoS computational biology	Mouse-Specific Single cell cytokine activity prediction and Estimation (MouSSE).	The accurate cell-level characterization of cytokine activity is important for understanding the signaling processes underpinning a wide range of immune-mediated conditions such as auto-immune disease, cancer and response to infection. We previously proposed the SCAPE (Single cell transcriptomics-level Cytokine Activity Prediction and Estimation) method to address the challenges associated with cytokine activity estimation in human single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics (ST) data. Here, we propose a new method MouSSE (Mouse-Specific Single cell transcriptomics level cytokine activity prediction and Estimation) for performing cytokine activity estimation in murine scRNA-seq and ST data. MouSSE estimates the cell-level activity of 86 distinct cytokines using a gene set scoring approach. The cytokine-specific gene sets used by MouSSE are constructed using experimental cytokine stimulation data from the Immune Dictionary and cell-level scores are computed using a modification of the Variance-adjusted Mahalanobis (VAM) technique that supports both positive and negative gene weights. MouSSE is validated using data from both the Immune Dictionary via stratified cross-validation and external scRNA-seq and ST datasets against 10 cytokine activity estimation methods. These results demonstrate that MouSSE outperforms comparable methods for cell-level cytokine activity estimation in mouse scRNA-seq and ST data. An example vignette and installation instructions for the MouSSE R package are provided at https://github.com/azkajavaid/MousseR-package.
39546378	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	A signal-diffusion-based unsupervised contrastive representation learning for spatial transcriptomics analysis.	MOTIVATION: Spatial transcriptomics allows for the measurement of high-throughput gene expression data while preserving the spatial structure of tissues and histological images. Integrating gene expression, spatial information, and image data to learn discriminative low-dimensional representations is critical for dissecting tissue heterogeneity and analyzing biological functions. However, most existing methods have limitations in effectively utilizing spatial information and high-resolution histological images. We propose a signal-diffusion-based unsupervised contrast learning method (SDUCL) for learning low-dimensional latent embeddings of cells/spots. RESULTS: SDUCL integrates image features, spatial relationships, and gene expression information. We designed a signal diffusion microenvironment discovery algorithm, which effectively captures and integrates interaction information within the cellular microenvironment by simulating the biological signal diffusion process. By maximizing the mutual information between the local representation and the microenvironment representation of cells/spots, SDUCL learns more discriminative representations. SDUCL was employed to analyze spatial transcriptomics datasets from multiple species, encompassing both normal and tumor tissues. SDUCL performed well in downstream tasks such as clustering, visualization, trajectory inference, and differential gene analysis, thereby enhancing our understanding of tissue structure and tumor microenvironments. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: https://github.com/WeiMin-Li-visual/SDUCL.
40991330	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	DeCoST: unveiling cell type heterogeneity in spatial transcriptomics based on inter-domain alignment and Gaussian kernel conditional autoregressive.	Spatial transcriptomics (STs) has emerged as a transformative approach to elucidate cellular heterogeneity and spatial organization within complex tissue microenvironments. However, the analysis of ST data is challenged by limited spatial resolution, resulting in mixed expression profiles at each spatial location. Moreover, the precious spatial information is rarely exploited, and noise issues in spatial transcriptomes (STs) are often overlooked by computational deconvolution methods. In this study, a novel computational framework for STs deconvolution (DeCoST), called DeCoST, is presented. DeCoST capitalizes on the valuable spatial context information by integrating a Gaussian kernel-based conditional autoregressive model. Additionally, the method employs domain adaptation techniques to address platform effects between single-cell and ST data, enabling robust cell type identification. Evaluations on simulated datasets under diverse spatial configurations, as well as real-world case studies on human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, mouse olfactory bulb, and mouse brain samples, demonstrate the superior performance of DeCoST compared to existing deconvolution approaches. The method's ability to accurately map region-specific cell types and uncover spatial interactions advances our understanding of complex tissue organization and function, with broad applications in disease research and developmental biology.
37466210	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Spatial-MGCN: a novel multi-view graph convolutional network for identifying spatial domains with attention mechanism.	MOTIVATION: Recent advances in spatial transcriptomics technologies have enabled gene expression profiles while preserving spatial context. Accurately identifying spatial domains is crucial for downstream analysis and it requires the effective integration of gene expression profiles and spatial information. While increasingly computational methods have been developed for spatial domain detection, most of them cannot adaptively learn the complex relationship between gene expression and spatial information, leading to sub-optimal performance. RESULTS: To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel deep learning method named Spatial-MGCN for identifying spatial domains, which is a Multi-view Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) with attention mechanism. We first construct two neighbor graphs using gene expression profiles and spatial information, respectively. Then, a multi-view GCN encoder is designed to extract unique embeddings from both the feature and spatial graphs, as well as their shared embeddings by combining both graphs. Finally, a zero-inflated negative binomial decoder is used to reconstruct the original expression matrix by capturing the global probability distribution of gene expression profiles. Moreover, Spatial-MGCN incorporates a spatial regularization constraint into the features learning to preserve spatial neighbor information in an end-to-end manner. The experimental results show that Spatial-MGCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods consistently in several tasks, including spatial clustering and trajectory inference.
37387180	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	CLARIFY: cell-cell interaction and gene regulatory network refinement from spatially resolved transcriptomics.	MOTIVATION: Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in a cell provide the tight feedback needed to synchronize cell actions. However, genes in a cell also take input from, and provide signals to other neighboring cells. These cell-cell interactions (CCIs) and the GRNs deeply influence each other. Many computational methods have been developed for GRN inference in cells. More recently, methods were proposed to infer CCIs using single cell gene expression data with or without cell spatial location information. However, in reality, the two processes do not exist in isolation and are subject to spatial constraints. Despite this rationale, no methods currently exist to infer GRNs and CCIs using the same model. RESULTS: We propose CLARIFY, a tool that takes GRNs as input, uses them and spatially resolved gene expression data to infer CCIs, while simultaneously outputting refined cell-specific GRNs. CLARIFY uses a novel multi-level graph autoencoder, which mimics cellular networks at a higher level and cell-specific GRNs at a deeper level. We applied CLARIFY to two real spatial transcriptomic datasets, one using seqFISH and the other using MERFISH, and also tested on simulated datasets from scMultiSim. We compared the quality of predicted GRNs and CCIs with state-of-the-art baseline methods that inferred either only GRNs or only CCIs. The results show that CLARIFY consistently outperforms the baseline in terms of commonly used evaluation metrics. Our results point to the importance of co-inference of CCIs and GRNs and to the use of layered graph neural networks as an inference tool for biological networks. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code and data is available at https://github.com/MihirBafna/CLARIFY.
40481364	2025	Nature methods	Spotiflow: accurate and efficient spot detection for fluorescence microscopy with deep stereographic flow regression.	Identification of spot-like structures in large, noisy microscopy images is a crucial step for many life-science applications. Imaging-based spatial transcriptomics (iST), in particular, relies on the precise detection of millions of transcripts in low signal-to-noise images. Despite recent advances in computer vision, most of the currently used spot detection techniques are still based on classical signal processing and require tedious manual tuning per dataset. Here we introduce Spotiflow, a deep learning method for subpixel-accurate spot detection that formulates spot detection as a multiscale heatmap and stereographic flow regression problem. Spotiflow supports 2D and 3D images, generalizes across different imaging conditions and is more time and memory efficient than existing methods. We show the efficacy of Spotiflow by extensive quantitative experiments on diverse datasets and demonstrate that its increased accuracy leads to meaningful improvements in biological insights obtained from iST and live imaging experiments. Spotiflow is available as an easy-to-use Python library as well as a napari plugin at https://github.com/weigertlab/spotiflow .
39833103	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	BIOTIC: a Bayesian framework to integrate single-cell multi-omics for transcription factor activity inference and improve identity characterization of cells.	Understanding cell destiny requires unraveling the intricate mechanism of gene regulation, where transcription factors (TFs) play a pivotal role. However, the actual contribution of TFs, that is TF activity, is not only determined by TF expression, but also accessibility of corresponding chromatin regions. Therefore, we introduce BIOTIC, an advanced Bayesian model with a well-established gene regulation structure that harnesses the power of single-cell multi-omics data to model the gene expression process under the control of regulatory elements, thereby defining the regulatory activity of TFs with variational inference. We demonstrated that the TF activity inferred by BIOTIC can serve as a characterization of cell identity, and outperforms baseline methods for the tasks of cell typing, cell development tracking, and batch effect correction. Additionally, BIOTIC trained on multi-omics data can flexibly be applied to the scenario where merely single-cell transcriptome sequencing is available, to infer TF activity and annotate the cell type by mapping the query cell into the reference TF activity space, as an emerging application of cell atlases. The structure of BIOTIC has been determined to be adaptable for the inclusion of additional biological factors, allowing for flexible and more comprehensive gene regulation analysis. BIOTIC introduces a pioneering biological-mechanism-driven framework to infer TF activity and elucidate cell identity states at gene regulatory level, paving the way for a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between TFs and gene expression in living systems.
36353986	2023	Nucleic acids research	COMBATdb: a database for the COVID-19 Multi-Omics Blood ATlas.	Advances in our understanding of the nature of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and how this varies within and between individuals, is important in efforts to develop targeted therapies and precision medicine approaches. Here we present a database for the COvid-19 Multi-omics Blood ATlas (COMBAT) project, COMBATdb (https://db.combat.ox.ac.uk). This enables exploration of multi-modal datasets arising from profiling of patients with different severities of illness admitted to hospital in the first phase of the pandemic in the UK prior to vaccination, compared with community cases, healthy controls, and patients with all-cause sepsis and influenza. These data include whole blood transcriptomics, plasma proteomics, epigenomics, single-cell multi-omics, immune repertoire sequencing, flow and mass cytometry, and cohort metadata. COMBATdb provides access to the processed data in a well-defined framework of samples, cell types and genes/proteins that allows exploration across the assayed modalities, with functionality including browse, search, download, calculation and visualisation via shiny apps. This advances the ability of users to leverage COMBAT datasets to understand the pathogenesis of COVID-19, and the nature of specific and shared features with other infectious diseases.
36179087	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	SpaceX: gene co-expression network estimation for spatial transcriptomics.	MOTIVATION: The analysis of spatially resolved transcriptome enables the understanding of the spatial interactions between the cellular environment and transcriptional regulation. In particular, the characterization of the gene-gene co-expression at distinct spatial locations or cell types in the tissue enables delineation of spatial co-regulatory patterns as opposed to standard differential single gene analyses. To enhance the ability and potential of spatial transcriptomics technologies to drive biological discovery, we develop a statistical framework to detect gene co-expression patterns in a spatially structured tissue consisting of different clusters in the form of cell classes or tissue domains. RESULTS: We develop SpaceX (spatially dependent gene co-expression network), a Bayesian methodology to identify both shared and cluster-specific co-expression network across genes. SpaceX uses an over-dispersed spatial Poisson model coupled with a high-dimensional factor model which is based on a dimension reduction technique for computational efficiency. We show via simulations, accuracy gains in co-expression network estimation and structure by accounting for (increasing) spatial correlation and appropriate noise distributions. In-depth analysis of two spatial transcriptomics datasets in mouse hypothalamus and human breast cancer using SpaceX, detected multiple hub genes which are related to cognitive abilities for the hypothalamus data and multiple cancer genes (e.g. collagen family) from the tumor region for the breast cancer data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The SpaceX R-package is available at github.com/bayesrx/SpaceX. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
38444087	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	SpatialView: an interactive web application for visualization of multiple samples in spatial transcriptomics experiments.	MOTIVATION: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) experiments provide spatially localized measurements of genome-wide gene expression allowing for an unprecedented opportunity to investigate cellular heterogeneity and organization within a tissue. Statistical and computational frameworks exist that implement robust methods for pre-processing and analyzing data in ST experiments. However, the lack of an interactive suite of tools for visualizing ST data and results currently limits the full potential of ST experiments. RESULTS: To fill the gap, we developed SpatialView, an open-source web browser-based interactive application for visualizing data and results from multiple 10x Genomics Visium ST experiments. We anticipate SpatialView will be useful to a broad array of clinical and basic science investigators utilizing ST to study disease. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: SpatialView is available at https://github.com/kendziorski-lab/SpatialView (and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10223907); a demo application is available at https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/ kendzior/spatialviewdemo/.
33179747	2021	Nucleic acids research	jMorp updates in 2020: large enhancement of multi-omics data resources on the general Japanese population.	In the Tohoku Medical Megabank project, genome and omics analyses of participants in two cohort studies were performed. A part of the data is available at the Japanese Multi Omics Reference Panel (jMorp; https://jmorp.megabank.tohoku.ac.jp) as a web-based database, as reported in our previous manuscript published in Nucleic Acid Research in 2018. At that time, jMorp mainly consisted of metabolome data; however, now genome, methylome, and transcriptome data have been integrated in addition to the enhancement of the number of samples for the metabolome data. For genomic data, jMorp provides a Japanese reference sequence obtained using de novo assembly of sequences from three Japanese individuals and allele frequencies obtained using whole-genome sequencing of 8,380 Japanese individuals. In addition, the omics data include methylome and transcriptome data from  approximately 300 samples and distribution of concentrations of more than 755 metabolites obtained using high-throughput nuclear magnetic resonance and high-sensitivity mass spectrometry. In summary, jMorp now provides four different kinds of omics data (genome, methylome, transcriptome, and metabolome), with a user-friendly web interface. This will be a useful scientific data resource on the general population for the discovery of disease biomarkers and personalized disease prevention and early diagnosis.
39470725	2024	Nucleic acids research	Spatial pattern and differential expression analysis with spatial transcriptomic data.	The emergence of spatial transcriptomic technologies has opened new avenues for investigating gene activities while preserving the spatial context of tissues. Utilizing data generated by such technologies, the identification of spatially variable (SV) genes is an essential step in exploring tissue landscapes and biological processes. Particularly in typical experimental designs, such as case-control or longitudinal studies, identifying SV genes between groups is crucial for discovering significant biomarkers or developing targeted therapies for diseases. However, current methods available for analyzing spatial transcriptomic data are still in their infancy, and none of the existing methods are capable of identifying SV genes between groups. To overcome this challenge, we developed SPADE for spatial pattern and differential expression analysis to identify SV genes in spatial transcriptomic data. SPADE is based on a machine learning model of Gaussian process regression with a gene-specific Gaussian kernel, enabling the detection of SV genes both within and between groups. Through benchmarking against existing methods in extensive simulations and real data analyses, we demonstrated the preferred performance of SPADE in detecting SV genes within and between groups. The SPADE source code and documentation are publicly available at https://github.com/thecailab/SPADE.
39420631	2025	Nucleic acids research	scTWAS Atlas: an integrative knowledgebase of single-cell transcriptome-wide association studies.	Single-cell transcriptome-wide association studies (scTWAS) is a new method for conducting TWAS analysis at the cellular level to identify gene-trait associations with higher precision. This approach helps overcome the challenge of interpreting cell-type heterogeneity in traditional TWAS results. As the field of scTWAS rapidly advances, there is a growing need for additional database platforms to integrate this wealth of data and knowledge effectively. To address this gap, we present scTWAS Atlas (https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/sctwas/), a comprehensive database of scTWAS information integrating literature curation and data analysis. The current version of scTWAS Atlas amasses 2,765,211 associations encompassing 34 traits, 30 cell types, 9 cell conditions and 16,470 genes. The database features visualization tools, including an interactive knowledge graph that integrates single-cell expression quantitative trait loci (sc-eQTL) and scTWAS associations to build a multi-omics level regulatory network at the cellular level. Additionally, scTWAS Atlas facilitates cross-cell-type analysis, highlighting cell-type-specific and shared TWAS genes. The database is designed with user-friendly interfaces and allows for easy browsing, searching, and downloading of relevant information. Overall, scTWAS Atlas is instrumental in exploring the genetic regulatory mechanisms at the cellular level and shedding light on the role of various cell types in biological processes, offering novel insights for human health research.
34252941	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	stPlus: a reference-based method for the accurate enhancement of spatial transcriptomics.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) techniques have revolutionized the investigation of transcriptomic landscape in individual cells. Recent advancements in spatial transcriptomic technologies further enable gene expression profiling and spatial organization mapping of cells simultaneously. Among the technologies, imaging-based methods can offer higher spatial resolutions, while they are limited by either the small number of genes imaged or the low gene detection sensitivity. Although several methods have been proposed for enhancing spatially resolved transcriptomics, inadequate accuracy of gene expression prediction and insufficient ability of cell-population identification still impede the applications of these methods. RESULTS: We propose stPlus, a reference-based method that leverages information in scRNA-seq data to enhance spatial transcriptomics. Based on an auto-encoder with a carefully tailored loss function, stPlus performs joint embedding and predicts spatial gene expression via a weighted k-nearest-neighbor. stPlus outperforms baseline methods with higher gene-wise and cell-wise Spearman correlation coefficients. We also introduce a clustering-based approach to assess the enhancement performance systematically. Using the data enhanced by stPlus, cell populations can be better identified than using the measured data. The predicted expression of genes unique to scRNA-seq data can also well characterize spatial cell heterogeneity. Besides, stPlus is robust and scalable to datasets of diverse gene detection sensitivity levels, sample sizes and number of spatially measured genes. We anticipate stPlus will facilitate the analysis of spatial transcriptomics. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: stPlus with detailed documents is freely accessible at http://health.tsinghua.edu.cn/software/stPlus/ and the source code is openly available on https://github.com/xy-chen16/stPlus.
28605519	2017	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	CancerSubtypes: an R/Bioconductor package for molecular cancer subtype identification, validation and visualization.	SUMMARY: Identifying molecular cancer subtypes from multi-omics data is an important step in the personalized medicine. We introduce CancerSubtypes, an R package for identifying cancer subtypes using multi-omics data, including gene expression, miRNA expression and DNA methylation data. CancerSubtypes integrates four main computational methods which are highly cited for cancer subtype identification and provides a standardized framework for data pre-processing, feature selection, and result follow-up analyses, including results computing, biology validation and visualization. The input and output of each step in the framework are packaged in the same data format, making it convenience to compare different methods. The package is useful for inferring cancer subtypes from an input genomic dataset, comparing the predictions from different well-known methods and testing new subtype discovery methods, as shown with different application scenarios in the Supplementary Material. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The package is implemented in R and available under GPL-2 license from the Bioconductor website (http://bioconductor.org/packages/CancerSubtypes/). CONTACT: thuc.le@unisa.edu.au or jiuyong.li@unisa.edu.au. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
33861732	2021	PLoS computational biology	Accurate cancer phenotype prediction with AKLIMATE, a stacked kernel learner integrating multimodal genomic data and pathway knowledge.	"Advancements in sequencing have led to the proliferation of multi-omic profiles of human cells under different conditions and perturbations. In addition, many databases have amassed information about pathways and gene ""signatures""-patterns of gene expression associated with specific cellular and phenotypic contexts. An important current challenge in systems biology is to leverage such knowledge about gene coordination to maximize the predictive power and generalization of models applied to high-throughput datasets. However, few such integrative approaches exist that also provide interpretable results quantifying the importance of individual genes and pathways to model accuracy. We introduce AKLIMATE, a first kernel-based stacked learner that seamlessly incorporates multi-omics feature data with prior information in the form of pathways for either regression or classification tasks. AKLIMATE uses a novel multiple-kernel learning framework where individual kernels capture the prediction propensities recorded in random forests, each built from a specific pathway gene set that integrates all omics data for its member genes. AKLIMATE has comparable or improved performance relative to state-of-the-art methods on diverse phenotype learning tasks, including predicting microsatellite instability in endometrial and colorectal cancer, survival in breast cancer, and cell line response to gene knockdowns. We show how AKLIMATE is able to connect feature data across data platforms through their common pathways to identify examples of several known and novel contributors of cancer and synthetic lethality."
39420637	2025	Nucleic acids research	scTML: a pan-cancer single-cell landscape of multiple mutation types.	Investigating mutations, including single nucleotide variations (SNVs), gene fusions, alternative splicing and copy number variations (CNVs), is fundamental to cancer study. Recent computational methods and biological research have demonstrated the reliability and biological significance of detecting mutations from single-cell transcriptomic data. However, there is a lack of a single-cell-level database containing comprehensive mutation information in all types of cancer. Establishing a single-cell mutation landscape from the huge emerging single-cell transcriptomic data can provide a critical resource for elucidating the mechanisms of tumorigenesis and evolution. Here, we developed scTML (http://sctml.xglab.tech/), the first database offering a pan-cancer single-cell landscape of multiple mutation types. It includes SNVs, insertions/deletions, gene fusions, alternative splicing and CNVs, along with gene expression, cell states and other phenotype information. The data are from 74 datasets with 2 582 633 cells, including 35 full-length (Smart-seq2) transcriptomic single-cell datasets (all publicly available data with raw sequencing files), 23 datasets from 10X technology and 16 spatial transcriptomic datasets. scTML enables users to interactively explore multiple mutation landscapes across tumors or cell types, analyze single-cell-level mutation-phenotype associations and detect cell subclusters of interest. scTML is an important resource that will significantly advance deciphering intra-tumor and inter-tumor heterogeneity, and how mutations shape cell phenotypes.
37858234	2023	Genome biology	Dual spatially resolved transcriptomics for human host-pathogen colocalization studies in FFPE tissue sections.	Technologies to study localized host-pathogen interactions are urgently needed. Here, we present a spatial transcriptomics approach to simultaneously capture host and pathogen transcriptome-wide spatial gene expression information from human formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections at a near single-cell resolution. We demonstrate this methodology in lung samples from COVID-19 patients and validate our spatial detection of SARS-CoV-2 against RNAScope and in situ sequencing. Host-pathogen colocalization analysis identified putative modulators of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung cells. Our approach provides new insights into host response to pathogen infection through the simultaneous, unbiased detection of two transcriptomes in FFPE samples.
38418648	2025	Nature biotechnology	Morphological diversification and functional maturation of human astrocytes in glia-enriched cortical organoid transplanted in mouse brain.	Astrocytes, the most abundant glial cell type in the brain, are underrepresented in traditional cortical organoid models due to the delayed onset of cortical gliogenesis. Here we introduce a new glia-enriched cortical organoid model that exhibits accelerated astrogliogenesis. We demonstrated that induction of a gliogenic switch in a subset of progenitors enabled the rapid derivation of astroglial cells, which account for 25-31% of the cell population within 8-10 weeks of differentiation. Intracerebral transplantation of these organoids reliably generated a diverse repertoire of cortical neurons and anatomical subclasses of human astrocytes. Spatial transcriptome profiling identified layer-specific expression patterns among distinct subclasses of astrocytes within organoid transplants. Using an in vivo acute neuroinflammation model, we identified a subpopulation of astrocytes that rapidly activates pro-inflammatory pathways upon cytokine stimulation. Additionally, we demonstrated that CD38 signaling has a crucial role in mediating metabolic and mitochondrial stress in reactive astrocytes. This model provides a robust platform for investigating human astrocyte function.
38965443	2024	Nature methods	Systematic comparison of sequencing-based spatial transcriptomic methods.	Recent developments of sequencing-based spatial transcriptomics (sST) have catalyzed important advancements by facilitating transcriptome-scale spatial gene expression measurement. Despite this progress, efforts to comprehensively benchmark different platforms are currently lacking. The extant variability across technologies and datasets poses challenges in formulating standardized evaluation metrics. In this study, we established a collection of reference tissues and regions characterized by well-defined histological architectures, and used them to generate data to compare 11 sST methods. We highlighted molecular diffusion as a variable parameter across different methods and tissues, significantly affecting the effective resolutions. Furthermore, we observed that spatial transcriptomic data demonstrate unique attributes beyond merely adding a spatial axis to single-cell data, including an enhanced ability to capture patterned rare cell states along with specific markers, albeit being influenced by multiple factors including sequencing depth and resolution. Our study assists biologists in sST platform selection, and helps foster a consensus on evaluation standards and establish a framework for future benchmarking efforts that can be used as a gold standard for the development and benchmarking of computational tools for spatial transcriptomic analysis.
40138718	2025	Nucleic acids research	Single-cell genome and transcriptome sequencing without upfront whole-genome amplification reveals cell state plasticity of melanoma subclones.	Single-cell multi-omics methods enable the study of cell state diversity, which is largely determined by the interplay of the genome, epigenome, and transcriptome. Here, we describe Gtag&T-seq, a genome-and-transcriptome sequencing (G&T-seq) protocol of the same single cells that omits whole-genome amplification (WGA) by using direct genomic tagmentation (Gtag). Gtag drastically decreases the cost and improves coverage uniformity at single-cell and pseudo-bulk levels compared to WGA-based G&T-seq. We also show that transcriptome-based DNA copy number inference has limited resolution and accuracy, underlining the importance of affordable multi-omic approaches. Applying Gtag&T-seq to a melanoma xenograft model before treatment and at minimal residual disease revealed differential cell state plasticity and treatment response between cancer subclones. In summary, Gtag&T-seq is a low-cost and accurate single-cell multi-omics method that explores genetic alterations and their functional consequences in single cells at scale.
38366652	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	SpatialDDLS: an R package to deconvolute spatial transcriptomics data using neural networks.	SUMMARY: Spatial transcriptomics has changed our way to study tissue structure and cellular organization. However, there are still limitations in its resolution, and most available platforms do not reach a single cell resolution. To address this issue, we introduce SpatialDDLS, a fast neural network-based algorithm for cell type deconvolution of spatial transcriptomics data. SpatialDDLS leverages single-cell RNA sequencing data to simulate mixed transcriptional profiles with predefined cellular composition, which are subsequently used to train a fully connected neural network to uncover cell type diversity within each spot. By comparing it with two state-of-the-art spatial deconvolution methods, we demonstrate that SpatialDDLS is an accurate and fast alternative to the available state-of-the art tools. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The R package SpatialDDLS is available via CRAN-The Comprehensive R Archive Network: https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SpatialDDLS. A detailed manual of the main functionalities implemented in the package can be found at https://diegommcc.github.io/SpatialDDLS.
34383882	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Using high-throughput multi-omics data to investigate structural balance in elementary gene regulatory network motifs.	MOTIVATION: The simultaneous availability of ATAC-seq and RNA-seq experiments allows to obtain a more in-depth knowledge on the regulatory mechanisms occurring in gene regulatory networks. In this article, we highlight and analyze two novel aspects that leverage on the possibility of pairing RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data. Namely we investigate the causality of the relationships between transcription factors, chromatin and target genes and the internal consistency between the two omics, here measured in terms of structural balance in the sample correlations along elementary length-3 cycles. RESULTS: We propose a framework that uses the a priori knowledge on the data to infer elementary causal regulatory motifs (namely chains and forks) in the network. It is based on the notions of conditional independence and partial correlation, and can be applied to both longitudinal and non-longitudinal data. Our analysis highlights a strong connection between the causal regulatory motifs that are selected by the data and the structural balance of the underlying sample correlation graphs: strikingly, >97% of the selected regulatory motifs belong to a balanced subgraph. This result shows that internal consistency, as measured by structural balance, is close to a necessary condition for 3-node regulatory motifs to satisfy causality rules. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The analysis was carried out in MATLAB and the code can be found at https://github.com/albertozenere/Multi-omics-elementary-regulatory-motifs. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
36344834	2022	Nature methods	High-dimensional gene expression and morphology profiles of cells across 28,000 genetic and chemical perturbations.	Cells can be perturbed by various chemical and genetic treatments and the impact on gene expression and morphology can be measured via transcriptomic profiling and image-based assays, respectively. The patterns observed in these high-dimensional profile data can power a dozen applications in drug discovery and basic biology research, but both types of profiles are rarely available for large-scale experiments. Here, we provide a collection of four datasets with both gene expression and morphological profile data useful for developing and testing multimodal methodologies. Roughly a thousand features are measured for each of the two data types, across more than 28,000 chemical and genetic perturbations. We define biological problems that use the shared and complementary information in these two data modalities, provide baseline analysis and evaluation metrics for multi-omic applications, and make the data resource publicly available ( https://broad.io/rosetta/ ).
34752449	2021	PLoS computational biology	Approximate distance correlation for selecting highly interrelated genes across datasets.	With the rapid accumulation of biological omics datasets, decoding the underlying relationships of cross-dataset genes becomes an important issue. Previous studies have attempted to identify differentially expressed genes across datasets. However, it is hard for them to detect interrelated ones. Moreover, existing correlation-based algorithms can only measure the relationship between genes within a single dataset or two multi-modal datasets from the same samples. It is still unclear how to quantify the strength of association of the same gene across two biological datasets with different samples. To this end, we propose Approximate Distance Correlation (ADC) to select interrelated genes with statistical significance across two different biological datasets. ADC first obtains the k most correlated genes for each target gene as its approximate observations, and then calculates the distance correlation (DC) for the target gene across two datasets. ADC repeats this process for all genes and then performs the Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment to control the false discovery rate. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ADC with simulation data and four real applications to select highly interrelated genes across two datasets. These four applications including 21 cancer RNA-seq datasets of different tissues; six single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) datasets of mouse hematopoietic cells across six different cell types along the hematopoietic cell lineage; five scRNA-seq datasets of pancreatic islet cells across five different technologies; coupled single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) and scRNA-seq data of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Extensive results demonstrate that ADC is a powerful tool to uncover interrelated genes with strong biological implications and is scalable to large-scale datasets. Moreover, the number of such genes can serve as a metric to measure the similarity between two datasets, which could characterize the relative difference of diverse cell types and technologies.
38783706	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Predicting RNA polymerase II transcriptional elongation pausing and associated histone code.	RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) transcriptional elongation pausing is an integral part of the dynamic regulation of gene transcription in the genome of metazoans. It plays a pivotal role in many vital biological processes and disease progression. However, experimentally measuring genome-wide Pol II pausing is technically challenging and the precise governing mechanism underlying this process is not fully understood. Here, we develop RP3 (RNA Polymerase II Pausing Prediction), a network regularized logistic regression machine learning method, to predict Pol II pausing events by integrating genome sequence, histone modification, gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and protein-protein interaction data. RP3 can accurately predict Pol II pausing in diverse cellular contexts and unveil the transcription factors that are associated with the Pol II pausing machinery. Furthermore, we utilize a forward feature selection framework to systematically identify the combination of histone modification signals associated with Pol II pausing. RP3 is freely available at https://github.com/AMSSwanglab/RP3.
38806165	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Impeller: a path-based heterogeneous graph learning method for spatial transcriptomic data imputation.	MOTIVATION: Recent advances in spatial transcriptomics allow spatially resolved gene expression measurements with cellular or even sub-cellular resolution, directly characterizing the complex spatiotemporal gene expression landscape and cell-to-cell interactions in their native microenvironments. Due to technology limitations, most spatial transcriptomic technologies still yield incomplete expression measurements with excessive missing values. Therefore, gene imputation is critical to filling in missing data, enhancing resolution, and improving overall interpretability. However, existing methods either require additional matched single-cell RNA-seq data, which is rarely available, or ignore spatial proximity or expression similarity information. RESULTS: To address these issues, we introduce Impeller, a path-based heterogeneous graph learning method for spatial transcriptomic data imputation. Impeller has two unique characteristics distinct from existing approaches. First, it builds a heterogeneous graph with two types of edges representing spatial proximity and expression similarity. Therefore, Impeller can simultaneously model smooth gene expression changes across spatial dimensions and capture similar gene expression signatures of faraway cells from the same type. Moreover, Impeller incorporates both short- and long-range cell-to-cell interactions (e.g. via paracrine and endocrine) by stacking multiple GNN layers. We use a learnable path operator in Impeller to avoid the over-smoothing issue of the traditional Laplacian matrices. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets from three popular platforms and two species demonstrate the superiority of Impeller over various state-of-the-art imputation methods. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The code and preprocessed data used in this study are available at https://github.com/aicb-ZhangLabs/Impeller and https://zenodo.org/records/11212604.
33070182	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Integrative analysis of multi-omics data for discovering low-frequency variants associated with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.	MOTIVATION: The abundance of omics data has facilitated integrative analyses of single and multiple molecular layers with genome-wide association studies focusing on common variants. Built on its successes, we propose a general analysis framework to leverage multi-omics data with sequencing data to improve the statistical power of discovering new associations and understanding of the disease susceptibility due to low-frequency variants. The proposed test features its robustness to model misspecification, high power across a wide range of scenarios and the potential of offering insights into the underlying genetic architecture and disease mechanisms. RESULTS: Using the Framingham Heart Study data, we show that low-frequency variants are predictive of DNA methylation, even after conditioning on the nearby common variants. In addition, DNA methylation and gene expression provide complementary information to functional genomics. In the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children with a sample size of 1497, one gene CLPTM1 is identified to be associated with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by the proposed powerful adaptive gene-based test integrating information from gene expression, methylation and enhancer-promoter interactions. It is further replicated in the TwinsUK study with 1706 samples. The signal is driven by both low-frequency and common variants. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Models are available at https://github.com/ytzhong/DNAm. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
40954304	2025	Nature methods	Cancer subclone detection based on DNA copy number in single-cell and spatial omic sequencing data.	Somatic mutations such as copy number alterations accumulate during cancer progression, driving intratumor heterogeneity that impacts therapy effectiveness. Understanding the characteristics and spatial distribution of genetically distinct subclones is essential for unraveling tumor evolution and improving cancer treatment. Here we present Clonalscope, a subclone detection method using copy number profiles, applicable to spatial transcriptomics and single-cell sequencing data. Clonalscope implements a nested Chinese Restaurant Process to identify de novo tumor subclones, which can incorporate prior information from matched bulk DNA sequencing data for improved subclone detection and malignant cell labeling. On single-cell RNA sequencing and single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing data from gastrointestinal tumors, Clonalscope successfully labeled malignant cells and identified genetically different subclones with thorough validations. On spatial transcriptomics data from various primary and metastasized tumors, Clonalscope labeled malignant spots, traced subclones and identified spatially segregated subclones with distinct differentiation levels and expression of genes associated with drug resistance and survival.
37337206	2023	Genome biology	Characterization of novel loci controlling seed oil content in Brassica napus by marker metabolite-based multi-omics analysis.	BACKGROUND: Seed oil content is an important agronomic trait of Brassica napus (B. napus), and metabolites are considered as the bridge between genotype and phenotype for physical traits. RESULTS: Using a widely targeted metabolomics analysis in a natural population of 388 B. napus inbred lines, we quantify 2172 metabolites in mature seeds by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, in which 131 marker metabolites are identified to be correlated with seed oil content. These metabolites are then selected for further metabolite genome-wide association study and metabolite transcriptome-wide association study. Combined with weighted correlation network analysis, we construct a triple relationship network, which includes 21,000 edges and 4384 nodes among metabolites, metabolite quantitative trait loci, genes, and co-expression modules. We validate the function of BnaA03.TT4, BnaC02.TT4, and BnaC05.UK, three candidate genes predicted by multi-omics analysis, which show significant impacts on seed oil content through regulating flavonoid metabolism in B. napus. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the advantage of utilizing marker metabolites integrated with multi-omics analysis to dissect the genetic basis of agronomic traits in crops.
40087773	2025	Genome biology	A single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomic atlas of the COVID-19 liver reveals topological, functional, and regenerative organ disruption in patients.	BACKGROUND: The molecular underpinnings of organ dysfunction in severe COVID-19 and its potential long-term sequelae are under intense investigation. To shed light on these in the context of liver function, we perform single-nucleus RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomic profiling of livers from 17 COVID-19 decedents. RESULTS: We identify hepatocytes positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA with an expression phenotype resembling infected lung epithelial cells, and a central role in a pro-fibrotic TGFbeta signaling cell-cell communications network. Integrated analysis and comparisons with healthy controls reveal extensive changes in the cellular composition and expression states in COVID-19 liver, providing the underpinning of hepatocellular injury, ductular reaction, pathologic vascular expansion, and fibrogenesis characteristic of COVID-19 cholangiopathy. We also observe Kupffer cell proliferation and erythrocyte progenitors for the first time in a human liver single-cell atlas. Despite the absence of a clinical acute liver injury phenotype, endothelial cell composition is dramatically impacted in COVID-19, concomitantly with extensive alterations and profibrogenic activation of reactive cholangiocytes and mesenchymal cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our atlas provides novel insights into liver physiology and pathology in COVID-19 and forms a foundational resource for its investigation and understanding.
36068320	2022	Nature methods	MIRA: joint regulatory modeling of multimodal expression and chromatin accessibility in single cells.	Rigorously comparing gene expression and chromatin accessibility in the same single cells could illuminate the logic of how coupling or decoupling of these mechanisms regulates fate commitment. Here we present MIRA, probabilistic multimodal models for integrated regulatory analysis, a comprehensive methodology that systematically contrasts transcription and accessibility to infer the regulatory circuitry driving cells along cell state trajectories. MIRA leverages topic modeling of cell states and regulatory potential modeling of individual gene loci. MIRA thereby represents cell states in an efficient and interpretable latent space, infers high-fidelity cell state trees, determines key regulators of fate decisions at branch points and exposes the variable influence of local accessibility on transcription at distinct loci. Applied to epidermal differentiation and embryonic brain development from two different multimodal platforms, MIRA revealed that early developmental genes were tightly regulated by local chromatin landscape whereas terminal fate genes were titrated without requiring extensive chromatin remodeling.
32353146	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	CiteFuse enables multi-modal analysis of CITE-seq data.	MOTIVATION: Multi-modal profiling of single cells represents one of the latest technological advancements in molecular biology. Among various single-cell multi-modal strategies, cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) allows simultaneous quantification of two distinct species: RNA and cell-surface proteins. Here, we introduce CiteFuse, a streamlined package consisting of a suite of tools for doublet detection, modality integration, clustering, differential RNA and protein expression analysis, antibody-derived tag evaluation, ligand-receptor interaction analysis and interactive web-based visualization of CITE-seq data. RESULTS: We demonstrate the capacity of CiteFuse to integrate the two data modalities and its relative advantage against data generated from single-modality profiling using both simulations and real-world CITE-seq data. Furthermore, we illustrate a novel doublet detection method based on a combined index of cell hashing and transcriptome data. Finally, we demonstrate CiteFuse for predicting ligand-receptor interactions by using multi-modal CITE-seq data. Collectively, we demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of CiteFuse for the integrative analysis of transcriptome and epitope profiles from CITE-seq data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: CiteFuse is freely available at http://shiny.maths.usyd.edu.au/CiteFuse/ as an online web service and at https://github.com/SydneyBioX/CiteFuse/ as an R package.

41241819	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Advancing toxicity AI-based prediction with multilevel systems biology: a case study on genotoxicity.	The rapid expansion of chemical diversity presents substantial challenges for health and environmental risk assessment, necessitating the development of alternative, high-throughput computational methodologies. A key hurdle in toxicity prediction lies in the heterogeneous nature of adverse health outcomes at the tissue and cellular levels, as biological processes exhibit cell-type-specific and context-dependent responses. Effective prediction of individual-level health effects thus requires the integration of multimodal data, capturing both structural and biological perturbations induced by chemical exposures. We present GenotoxNet, a multimodal deep learning framework that enhances genotoxicity prediction by systematically integrating chemical structures, high-throughput in vitro assay data, and transcriptomics data. By leveraging this multimodal integration, GenotoxNet effectively captures cellular heterogeneity and mechanistic complexity, enabling more comprehensive evaluation of chemical-induced genotoxicity. The model outperformed single-modality approaches, achieving AUCROC of 0.891 +/- 0.017 on the internal test set, demonstrating superior predictive capability over models relying solely on chemical structures or individual biological features. The model still performed well on the external chemical set. Beyond classification, GenotoxNet facilitates mechanistic interpretation by aligning multimodal feature representations of genotoxic chemicals with adverse outcome pathway (AOP). This framework not only offers a robust approach for predicting genotoxicity but also aids in the development of preventive strategies and regulatory decisions aimed at mitigating the health risks posed by hazardous chemicals.
36394233	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	SEGCOND predicts putative transcriptional condensate-associated genomic regions by integrating multi-omics data.	MOTIVATION: The compartmentalization of biochemical reactions, involved in the activation of gene expression in the eukaryotic nucleus, leads to the formation of membraneless bodies through liquid-liquid phase separation. These formations, called transcriptional condensates, appear to play important roles in gene regulation as they are assembled through the association of multiple enhancer regions in 3D genomic space. To date, we are still lacking efficient computational methodologies to identify the regions responsible for the formation of such condensates, based on genomic and conformational data. RESULTS: In this work, we present SEGCOND, a computational framework aiming to highlight genomic regions involved in the formation of transcriptional condensates. SEGCOND is flexible in combining multiple genomic datasets related to enhancer activity and chromatin accessibility, to perform a genome segmentation. It then uses this segmentation for the detection of highly transcriptionally active regions of the genome. At a final step, and through the integration of Hi-C data, it identifies regions of putative transcriptional condensates (PTCs) as genomic domains where multiple enhancer elements coalesce in 3D space. SEGCOND identifies a subset of enhancer segments with increased transcriptional activity. PTCs are also found to significantly overlap highly interconnected enhancer elements and super enhancers obtained through two independent approaches. Application of SEGCOND on data from a well-defined system of B-cell to macrophage transdifferentiation leads to the identification of previously unreported genes with a likely role in the process. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Source code and details for the implementation of SEGCOND is available at https://github.com/AntonisK95/SEGCOND. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
36715269	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	DROEG: a method for cancer drug response prediction based on omics and essential genes integration.	Predicting therapeutic responses in cancer patients is a major challenge in the field of precision medicine due to high inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity. Most drug response models need to be improved in terms of accuracy, and there is limited research to assess therapeutic responses of particular tumor types. Here, we developed a novel method DROEG (Drug Response based on Omics and Essential Genes) for prediction of drug response in tumor cell lines by integrating genomic, transcriptomic and methylomic data along with CRISPR essential genes, and revealed that the incorporation of tumor proliferation essential genes can improve drug sensitivity prediction. Concisely, DROEG integrates literature-based and statistics-based methods to select features and uses Support Vector Regression for model construction. We demonstrate that DROEG outperforms most state-of-the-art algorithms by both qualitative (prediction accuracy for drug-sensitive/resistant) and quantitative (Pearson correlation coefficient between the predicted and actual IC50) evaluation in Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia datasets. In addition, DROEG is further applied to the pan-gastrointestinal tumor with high prevalence and mortality as a case study at both cell line and clinical levels to evaluate the model efficacy and discover potential prognostic biomarkers in Cisplatin and Epirubicin treatment. Interestingly, the CRISPR essential gene information is found to be the most important contributor to enhance the accuracy of the DROEG model. To our knowledge, this is the first study to integrate essential genes with multi-omics data to improve cancer drug response prediction and provide insights into personalized precision treatment.
39701602	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	GAADE: identification spatially variable genes based on adaptive graph attention network.	The rapid advancement of spatial transcriptomics (ST) sequencing technology has made it possible to capture gene expression with spatial coordinate information at the cellular level. Although many methods in ST data analysis can detect spatially variable genes (SVGs), these methods often fail to identify genes with explicit spatial expression patterns due to the lack of consideration for spatial domains. Considering spatial domains is crucial for identifying SVGs as it focuses the analysis of gene expression changes on biologically relevant regions, aiding in the more accurate identification of SVGs associated with specific cell types. Existing methods for identifying SVGs based on spatial domains predefine spot similarity before training, which prevents adaptive learning and limits generalizability across different tissues or samples. This limitation may also lead to inaccurate identification of specific genes at boundary regions. To address these issues, we present GAADE, an unsupervised neural network architecture based on graph-structured data representation learning. GAADE stacks encoder/decoder layers and integrates a self-attention mechanism to reconstruct node attributes and graph structure, effectively capturing spatial domain structures of different sections. Consequently, we confine the identification of SVGs within spatial domains. By performing differential expression analysis on spots within the target spatial domain and their multi-order neighbors, GAADE detects genes with enriched expression patterns within defined domains. Comparative evaluations with five other popular methods on ST datasets across four different species, regions and tissues demonstrate that GAADE exhibits superior performance in detecting SVGs and capturing the extent of spatial gene expression variation.
29898898	2018	Genome research	Human-specific features of spatial gene expression and regulation in eight brain regions.	Molecular maps of the human brain alone do not inform us of the features unique to humans. Yet, the identification of these features is important for understanding both the evolution and nature of human cognition. Here, we approached this question by analyzing gene expression and H3K27ac chromatin modification data collected in eight brain regions of humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, a gibbon, and macaques. An analysis of spatial transcriptome trajectories across eight brain regions in four primate species revealed 1851 genes showing human-specific transcriptome differences in one or multiple brain regions, in contrast to 240 chimpanzee-specific differences. More than half of these human-specific differences represented elevated expression of genes enriched in neuronal and astrocytic markers in the human hippocampus, whereas the rest were enriched in microglial markers and displayed human-specific expression in several frontal cortical regions and the cerebellum. An analysis of the predicted regulatory interactions driving these differences revealed the role of transcription factors in species-specific transcriptome changes, and epigenetic modifications were linked to spatial expression differences conserved across species.
38243719	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scCancer2: data-driven in-depth annotations of the tumor microenvironment at single-level resolution.	SUMMARY: Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) is a powerful technique for decoding the complex cellular compositions in the tumor microenvironment (TME). As previous studies have defined many meaningful cell subtypes in several tumor types, there is a great need to computationally transfer these labels to new datasets. Also, different studies used different approaches or criteria to define the cell subtypes for the same major cell lineages. The relationships between the cell subtypes defined in different studies should be carefully evaluated. In this updated package scCancer2, designed for integrative tumor scRNA-seq data analysis, we developed a supervised machine learning framework to annotate TME cells with annotated cell subtypes from 15 scRNA-seq datasets with 594 samples in total. Based on the trained classifiers, we quantitatively constructed the similarity maps between the cell subtypes defined in different references by testing on all the 15 datasets. Secondly, to improve the identification of malignant cells, we designed a classifier by integrating large-scale pan-cancer TCGA bulk gene expression datasets and scRNA-seq datasets (10 cancer types, 175 samples, 663 857 cells). This classifier shows robust performances when no internal confidential reference cells are available. Thirdly, scCancer2 integrated a module to process the spatial transcriptomic data and analyze the spatial features of TME. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The package and user documentation are available at http://lifeome.net/software/sccancer2/ and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10477296.
40301877	2025	Genome biology	SpaNorm: spatially-aware normalization for spatial transcriptomics data.	Normalization of spatial transcriptomics data is challenging due to spatial association between region-specific library size and biology. We develop SpaNorm, the first spatially-aware normalization method that concurrently models library size effects and the underlying biology, segregates these effects, and thereby removes library size effects without removing biological information. Using 27 tissue samples from 6 datasets spanning 4 technological platforms, SpaNorm outperforms commonly used single-cell normalization approaches while retaining spatial domain information and detecting spatially variable genes. SpaNorm is versatile and works equally well for multicellular and subcellular spatial transcriptomics data with relatively robust performance under different segmentation methods.
30698638	2020	Briefings in bioinformatics	Cancer Target Gene Screening: a web application for breast cancer target gene screening using multi-omics data analysis.	Breast cancer comprises several molecular subtypes with distinct clinical features and treatment responses, and a substantial portion of each subtype remains incurable. A comprehensive analysis of multi-omics data and clinical profiles is required in order to better understand the biological complexity of this cancer type and to identify new prognostic and therapeutic markers. Thus, there arises a need for useful analytical tools to assist in the investigation and clinical management of the disease. We developed Cancer Target Gene Screening (CTGS), a web application that provides rapid and user-friendly analysis of multi-omics data sets from a large number of primary breast tumors. It allows the investigation of genomic and epigenomic aberrations, evaluation of transcriptomic profiles and performance of survival analyses and of bivariate correlations between layers of omics data. Notably, the genome-wide screening function of CTGS prioritizes candidate genes of clinical and biological significance among genes with copy number alteration, DNA methylation and dysregulated expression by the integrative analysis of different types of omics data in customized subgroups of breast cancer patients. These features may help in the identification of druggable cancer driver genes in a specific subtype or the clinical condition of human breast cancer. CTGS is available at http://ctgs.biohackers.net.
35609982	2022	Nucleic acids research	PaintOmics 4: new tools for the integrative analysis of multi-omics datasets supported by multiple pathway databases.	PaintOmics is a web server for the integrative analysis and visualisation of multi-omics datasets using biological pathway maps. PaintOmics 4 has several notable updates that improve and extend analyses. Three pathway databases are now supported: KEGG, Reactome and MapMan, providing more comprehensive pathway knowledge for animals and plants. New metabolite analysis methods fill gaps in traditional pathway-based enrichment methods. The metabolite hub analysis selects compounds with a high number of significant genes in their neighbouring network, suggesting regulation by gene expression changes. The metabolite class activity analysis tests the hypothesis that a metabolic class has a higher-than-expected proportion of significant elements, indicating that these compounds are regulated in the experiment. Finally, PaintOmics 4 includes a regulatory omics module to analyse the contribution of trans-regulatory layers (microRNA and transcription factors, RNA-binding proteins) to regulate pathways. We show the performance of PaintOmics 4 on both mouse and plant data to highlight how these new analysis features provide novel insights into regulatory biology. PaintOmics 4 is available at https://paintomics.org/.
38341653	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	SST-editing: in silico spatial transcriptomic editing at single-cell resolution.	MOTIVATION: Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) achieve impressive performance for text-guided editing of natural images. However, a comparable utility of GAN remains understudied for spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies with matched gene expression and biomedical image data. RESULTS: We propose In Silico Spatial Transcriptomic editing that enables gene expression-guided editing of immunofluorescence images. Using cell-level spatial transcriptomics data extracted from normal and tumor tissue slides, we train the approach under the framework of GAN (Inversion). To simulate cellular state transitions, we then feed edited gene expression levels to trained models. Compared to normal cellular images (ground truth), we successfully model the transition from tumor to normal tissue samples, as measured with quantifiable and interpretable cellular features. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: https://github.com/CTPLab/SST-editing.
36130266	2023	Nucleic acids research	HTCA: a database with an in-depth characterization of the single-cell human transcriptome.	Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is one of the most used single-cell omics in recent decades. The exponential growth of single-cell data has immense potential for large-scale integration and in-depth explorations that are more representative of the study population. Efforts have been made to consolidate published data, yet extensive characterization is still lacking. Many focused on raw-data database constructions while others concentrate mainly on gene expression queries. Hereby, we present HTCA (www.htcatlas.org), an interactive database constructed based on  approximately 2.3 million high-quality cells from  approximately 3000 scRNA-seq samples and comprised in-depth phenotype profiles of 19 healthy adult and matching fetal tissues. HTCA provides a one-stop interactive query to gene signatures, transcription factor (TF) activities, TF motifs, receptor-ligand interactions, enriched gene ontology (GO) terms, etc. across cell types in adult and fetal tissues. At the same time, HTCA encompasses single-cell splicing variant profiles of 16 adult and fetal tissues, spatial transcriptomics profiles of 11 adult and fetal tissues, and single-cell ATAC-sequencing (scATAC-seq) profiles of 27 adult and fetal tissues. Besides, HTCA provides online analysis tools to perform major steps in a typical scRNA-seq analysis. Altogether, HTCA allows real-time explorations of multi-omics adult and fetal phenotypic profiles and provides tools for a flexible scRNA-seq analysis.
40407386	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	StereoMM: a graph fusion model for integrating spatial transcriptomic data and pathological images.	Spatial omics technologies, generating high-throughput and multimodal data, have necessitated the development of advanced data integration methods to facilitate comprehensive biological and clinical treatment discoveries. Based on the cross-attention concept, we developed an AI learning based toolchain called StereoMM, a graph based fusion model that can incorporate omics data such as gene expression, histological images, and spatial location. StereoMM uses an attention module for omics data interaction and a graph autoencoder to integrate spatial positions and omics data in a self-supervised manner. Applying StereoMM across various cancer types and platforms has demonstrated its robust capability. StereoMM outperforms competitors in identifying spatial regions reflecting tumour progression and shows promise in classifying colorectal cancer patients into deficient mismatch repair and proficient mismatch repair groups. The comprehensive inter-modal integration and efficiency of StereoMM enable researchers to construct spatial views of integrated multimodal features efficiently, advancing thorough tissue and patient characterization.
31510656	2019	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Deep learning with multimodal representation for pancancer prognosis prediction.	MOTIVATION: Estimating the future course of patients with cancer lesions is invaluable to physicians; however, current clinical methods fail to effectively use the vast amount of multimodal data that is available for cancer patients. To tackle this problem, we constructed a multimodal neural network-based model to predict the survival of patients for 20 different cancer types using clinical data, mRNA expression data, microRNA expression data and histopathology whole slide images (WSIs). We developed an unsupervised encoder to compress these four data modalities into a single feature vector for each patient, handling missing data through a resilient, multimodal dropout method. Encoding methods were tailored to each data type-using deep highway networks to extract features from clinical and genomic data, and convolutional neural networks to extract features from WSIs. RESULTS: We used pancancer data to train these feature encodings and predict single cancer and pancancer overall survival, achieving a C-index of 0.78 overall. This work shows that it is possible to build a pancancer model for prognosis that also predicts prognosis in single cancer sites. Furthermore, our model handles multiple data modalities, efficiently analyzes WSIs and represents patient multimodal data flexibly into an unsupervised, informative representation. We thus present a powerful automated tool to accurately determine prognosis, a key step towards personalized treatment for cancer patients.

37349575	2023	Nature methods	Expansion spatial transcriptomics.	Capture array-based spatial transcriptomics methods have been widely used to resolve gene expression in tissues; however, their spatial resolution is limited by the density of the array. Here we present expansion spatial transcriptomics to overcome this limitation by clearing and expanding tissue prior to capturing the entire polyadenylated transcriptome with an enhanced protocol. This approach enables us to achieve higher spatial resolution while retaining high library quality, which we demonstrate using mouse brain samples.

37930022	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	COMO: a pipeline for multi-omics data integration in metabolic modeling and drug discovery.	Identifying potential drug targets using metabolic modeling requires integrating multiple modeling methods and heterogeneous biological datasets, which can be challenging without efficient tools. We developed Constraint-based Optimization of Metabolic Objectives (COMO), a user-friendly pipeline that integrates multi-omics data processing, context-specific metabolic model development, simulations, drug databases and disease data to aid drug discovery. COMO can be installed as a Docker Image or with Conda and includes intuitive instructions within a Jupyter Lab environment. It provides a comprehensive solution for the integration of bulk and single-cell RNA-seq, microarrays and proteomics outputs to develop context-specific metabolic models. Using public databases, open-source solutions for model construction and a streamlined approach for predicting repurposable drugs, COMO enables researchers to investigate low-cost alternatives and novel disease treatments. As a case study, we used the pipeline to construct metabolic models of B cells, which simulate and analyze them to predict metabolic drug targets for rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, respectively. COMO can be used to construct models for any cell or tissue type and identify drugs for any human disease where metabolic inhibition is relevant. The pipeline has the potential to improve the health of the global community cost-effectively by providing high-confidence targets to pursue in preclinical and clinical studies. The source code of the COMO pipeline is available at https://github.com/HelikarLab/COMO. The Docker image can be pulled at https://github.com/HelikarLab/COMO/pkgs/container/como.
35674358	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	meGPS: a multi-omics signature for hepatocellular carcinoma detection integrating methylome and transcriptome data.	MOTIVATION: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a primary malignancy with a poor prognosis. Recently, multi-omics molecular-level measurement enables HCC diagnosis and prognosis prediction, which is crucial for early intervention of personalized therapy to diminish mortality. Here, we introduce a novel strategy utilizing DNA methylation and RNA expression data to achieve a multi-omics gene pair signature (GPS) for HCC discrimination. RESULTS: The immune genes with negative correlations between expression and promoter methylation are enriched in the highly connected cancer-related pathway network, which are considered as the candidates for HCC detection. After that, we separately construct a methylation GPS (mGPS) and an expression GPS (eGPS), and then assemble them as a meGPS with five gene pairs, in which the significant methylation and expression changes occur between HCC tumor and non-tumor groups. Reliable performance has been validated by independent tissue (age, gender and etiology) and blood datasets. This study proposes a procedure for multi-omics GPS identification and develops a novel HCC signature using both methylome and transcriptome data, suggesting potential molecular targets for the detection and therapy of HCC. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Models are available at https://github.com/bioinformaticStudy/meGPS.git. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
33544846	2021	Nucleic acids research	SPOTlight: seeded NMF regression to deconvolute spatial transcriptomics spots with single-cell transcriptomes.	Spatially resolved gene expression profiles are key to understand tissue organization and function. However, spatial transcriptomics (ST) profiling techniques lack single-cell resolution and require a combination with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) information to deconvolute the spatially indexed datasets. Leveraging the strengths of both data types, we developed SPOTlight, a computational tool that enables the integration of ST with scRNA-seq data to infer the location of cell types and states within a complex tissue. SPOTlight is centered around a seeded non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) regression, initialized using cell-type marker genes and non-negative least squares (NNLS) to subsequently deconvolute ST capture locations (spots). Simulating varying reference quantities and qualities, we confirmed high prediction accuracy also with shallowly sequenced or small-sized scRNA-seq reference datasets. SPOTlight deconvolution of the mouse brain correctly mapped subtle neuronal cell states of the cortical layers and the defined architecture of the hippocampus. In human pancreatic cancer, we successfully segmented patient sections and further fine-mapped normal and neoplastic cell states. Trained on an external single-cell pancreatic tumor references, we further charted the localization of clinical-relevant and tumor-specific immune cell states, an illustrative example of its flexible application spectrum and future potential in digital pathology.
40829806	2025	Nucleic acids research	Inferring causal trajectories from spatial transcriptomics using CASCAT.	Spatial trajectory inference models cell differentiation and state dynamics within tissues by integrating spatial information. Existing spatial trajectory inference methods depend on similarity-based cell graphs constructed from spatial proximity, with less attention to the Markovian property in cell state transitions. In this study, we introduce CASCAT, a tree-shaped structural causal model with the Markovian property integrated to infer a unique cell differentiation trajectory, addressing challenges posed by Markov equivalence in high-dimensional and nonlinear data. CASCAT outperforms six state-of-the-art single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)-oriented methods across 10 simulated and seven real scRNA-seq datasets and exceeds three leading spatial trajectory inference methods on 13 real spatial transcriptomics datasets from multiple platforms. In the mouse inner olfactory bulb, CASCAT accurately differentiates maturation trajectories among specific cell types and reveals the Wnt signaling pathway by removing conditionally independent connections. Furthermore, by modeling post-treatment cancer cell trajectories through in silico simulations, CASCAT predicts drug responses in oral squamous cell carcinoma with a 6.8% increase in precision compared to RNA velocity-based methods, contributing to advances in computer-assisted drug discovery.

Finally, 13 new analytical tools have been added. Given these enhancements, the updated iDog 2.0 is an invaluable resource for the global cannie research community.
33184104	2020	Genome research	Predicting unrecognized enhancer-mediated genome topology by an ensemble machine learning model.	Transcriptional enhancers commonly work over long genomic distances to precisely regulate spatiotemporal gene expression patterns. Dissecting the promoters physically contacted by these distal regulatory elements is essential for understanding developmental processes as well as the role of disease-associated risk variants. Modern proximity-ligation assays, like HiChIP and ChIA-PET, facilitate the accurate identification of long-range contacts between enhancers and promoters. However, these assays are technically challenging, expensive, and time-consuming, making it difficult to investigate enhancer topologies, especially in uncharacterized cell types. To overcome these shortcomings, we therefore designed LoopPredictor, an ensemble machine learning model, to predict genome topology for cell types which lack long-range contact maps. To enrich for functional enhancer-promoter loops over common structural genomic contacts, we trained LoopPredictor with both H3K27ac and YY1 HiChIP data. Moreover, the integration of several related multi-omics features facilitated identifying and annotating the predicted loops. LoopPredictor is able to efficiently identify cell type-specific enhancer-mediated loops, and promoter-promoter interactions, with a modest feature input requirement. Comparable to experimentally generated H3K27ac HiChIP data, we found that LoopPredictor was able to identify functional enhancer loops. Furthermore, to explore the cross-species prediction capability of LoopPredictor, we fed mouse multi-omics features into a model trained on human data and found that the predicted enhancer loops outputs were highly conserved. LoopPredictor enables the dissection of cell type-specific long-range gene regulation and can accelerate the identification of distal disease-associated risk variants.

Module network inference is an established statistical method to reconstruct co-expression modules and their upstream regulatory programs from integrated multi-omics datasets measuring the activity levels of various cellular components across different individuals, experimental conditions or time points of a dynamic process. We have developed Lemon-Tree, an open-source, platform-independent, modular, extensible software package implementing state-of-the-art ensemble methods for module network inference. We benchmarked Lemon-Tree using large-scale tumor datasets and showed that Lemon-Tree algorithms compare favorably with state-of-the-art module network inference software. We also analyzed a large dataset of somatic copy-number alterations and gene expression levels measured in glioblastoma samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas and found that Lemon-Tree correctly identifies known glioblastoma oncogenes and tumor suppressors as master regulators in the inferred module network. Novel candidate driver genes predicted by Lemon-Tree were validated using tumor pathway and survival analyses.

39413798	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	SELF-Former: multi-scale gene filtration transformer for single-cell spatial reconstruction.	The spatial reconstruction of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data into spatial transcriptomics (ST) is a rapidly evolving field that addresses the significant challenge of aligning gene expression profiles to their spatial origins within tissues. This task is complicated by the inherent batch effects and the need for precise gene expression characterization to accurately reflect spatial information. To address these challenges, we developed SELF-Former, a transformer-based framework that utilizes multi-scale structures to learn gene representations, while designing spatial correlation constraints for the reconstruction of corresponding ST data. SELF-Former excels in recovering the spatial information of ST data and effectively mitigates batch effects between scRNA-seq and ST data. A novel aspect of SELF-Former is the introduction of a gene filtration module, which significantly enhances the spatial reconstruction task by selecting genes that are crucial for accurate spatial positioning and reconstruction. The superior performance and effectiveness of SELF-Former's modules have been validated across four benchmark datasets, establishing it as a robust and effective method for spatial reconstruction tasks. SELF-Former demonstrates its capability to extract meaningful gene expression information from scRNA-seq data and accurately map it to the spatial context of real ST data. Our method represents a significant advancement in the field, offering a reliable approach for spatial reconstruction.
39468737	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	GEEES: inferring cell-specific gene-enhancer interactions from multi-modal single-cell data.	"MOTIVATION: Gene-enhancer interactions are central to transcriptional regulation. Current multi-modal single-cell datasets that profile transcriptome and chromatin accessibility simultaneously in a single cell are yielding opportunities to infer gene-enhancer associations in a cell type specific manner. Computational efforts for such multi-modal single-cell datasets thus far focused on methods for identification and refinement of cell types and trajectory construction. While initial attempts for inferring gene-enhancer interactions have emerged, these have not been evaluated against benchmark datasets that materialized from bulk genomic experiments. Furthermore, existing approaches are limited to inferring gene-enhancer associations at the level of grouped cells as opposed to individual cells, thereby ignoring regulatory heterogeneity among the cells. RESULTS: We present a new approach, GEEES for ""Gene EnhancEr IntEractions from Multi-modal Single Cell Data,"" for inferring gene-enhancer associations at the single-cell level using multi-modal single-cell transcriptome and chromatin accessibility data. We evaluated GEEES alongside several multivariate regression-based alternatives we devised and state-of-the-art methods using a large number of benchmark datasets, providing a comprehensive assessment of current approaches. This analysis revealed significant discrepancies between gold-standard interactions and gene-enhancer associations derived from multi-modal single-cell data. Notably, incorporating gene-enhancer distance into the analysis markedly improved performance across all methods, positioning GEEES as a leading approach in this domain. While the overall improvement in performance metrics by GEEES is modest, it provides enhanced cell representation learning which can be leveraged for more effective downstream analysis. Furthermore, our review of existing experimentally driven benchmark datasets uncovers their limited concordance, underscoring the necessity for new high-throughput experiments to validate gene-enhancer interactions inferred from single-cell data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: https://github.com/keleslab/GEEES."
40931331	2025	Genome biology	High-resolution time-series transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling reveals the regulatory mechanism underlying salt tolerance in maize.	BACKGROUND: Soil salinization represents a critical global challenge to agricultural productivity, profoundly impacting crop yields and threatening food security. Plant salt-responsive is complex and dynamic, making it challenging to fully elucidate salt tolerance mechanism and leading to gaps in our understanding of how plants adapt to and mitigate salt stress. RESULTS: Here, we conduct high-resolution time-series transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling of the extremely salt-tolerant maize inbred line, HLZY, and the salt-sensitive elite line, JI853. Utilizing advanced data mining techniques, we identify key factors underlying the divergence in salt tolerance between these two lines and discover a series of novel genes and metabolites essential for maize salt tolerance. Additionally, we develop an innovative decision algorithm that enabled the construction of a high-confidence gene regulatory network for important salt-responsive metabolites. Comprehensive genetic and molecular studies further reveal the pivotal role of a hub gene, ZmGLN2, in regulating metabolite biosynthesis and salt tolerance in maize. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides the first high-resolution transcriptomic and metabolomic dataset for crop salt response, uncovering novel maize salt-responsive genes and metabolites. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of high-resolution multi-omics in deciphering the mechanisms underlying complex crop traits. Furthermore, we develop a systematic analytical framework for mining time-series multi-omics data, which can be broadly applied to other species or traits.
34548323	2021	Genome research	A single-cell tumor immune atlas for precision oncology.	The tumor immune microenvironment is a main contributor to cancer progression and a promising therapeutic target for oncology. However, immune microenvironments vary profoundly between patients, and biomarkers for prognosis and treatment response lack precision. A comprehensive compendium of tumor immune cells is required to pinpoint predictive cellular states and their spatial localization. We generated a single-cell tumor immune atlas, jointly analyzing published data sets of >500,000 cells from 217 patients and 13 cancer types, providing the basis for a patient stratification based on immune cell compositions. Projecting immune cells from external tumors onto the atlas facilitated an automated cell annotation system. To enable in situ mapping of immune populations for digital pathology, we applied SPOTlight, combining single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data and identifying colocalization patterns of immune, stromal, and cancer cells in tumor sections. We expect the tumor immune cell atlas, together with our versatile toolbox for precision oncology, to advance currently applied stratification approaches for prognosis and immunotherapy.
32240163	2020	PLoS computational biology	Multiview learning for understanding functional multiomics.	The molecular mechanisms and functions in complex biological systems currently remain elusive. Recent high-throughput techniques, such as next-generation sequencing, have generated a wide variety of multiomics datasets that enable the identification of biological functions and mechanisms via multiple facets. However, integrating these large-scale multiomics data and discovering functional insights are, nevertheless, challenging tasks. To address these challenges, machine learning has been broadly applied to analyze multiomics. This review introduces multiview learning-an emerging machine learning field-and envisions its potentially powerful applications to multiomics. In particular, multiview learning is more effective than previous integrative methods for learning data's heterogeneity and revealing cross-talk patterns. Although it has been applied to various contexts, such as computer vision and speech recognition, multiview learning has not yet been widely applied to biological data-specifically, multiomics data. Therefore, this paper firstly reviews recent multiview learning methods and unifies them in a framework called multiview empirical risk minimization (MV-ERM). We further discuss the potential applications of each method to multiomics, including genomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomics, in an aim to discover the functional and mechanistic interpretations across omics. Secondly, we explore possible applications to different biological systems, including human diseases (e.g., brain disorders and cancers), plants, and single-cell analysis, and discuss both the benefits and caveats of using multiview learning to discover the molecular mechanisms and functions of these systems.
37253690	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Precision oncology: a review to assess interpretability in several explainable methods.	Great efforts have been made to develop precision medicine-based treatments using machine learning. In this field, where the goal is to provide the optimal treatment for each patient based on his/her medical history and genomic characteristics, it is not sufficient to make excellent predictions. The challenge is to understand and trust the model's decisions while also being able to easily implement it. However, one of the issues with machine learning algorithms-particularly deep learning-is their lack of interpretability. This review compares six different machine learning methods to provide guidance for defining interpretability by focusing on accuracy, multi-omics capability, explainability and implementability. Our selection of algorithms includes tree-, regression- and kernel-based methods, which we selected for their ease of interpretation for the clinician. We also included two novel explainable methods in the comparison. No significant differences in accuracy were observed when comparing the methods, but an improvement was observed when using gene expression instead of mutational status as input for these methods. We concentrated on the current intriguing challenge: model comprehension and ease of use. Our comparison suggests that the tree-based methods are the most interpretable of those tested.
39470723	2025	Nucleic acids research	LnCeCell 2.0: an updated resource for lncRNA-associated ceRNA networks and web tools based on single-cell and spatial transcriptomics sequencing data.	We describe LnCeCell 2.0 (http://bio-bigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/LnCeCell), an updated resource for lncRNA-associated competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks and web tools based on single-cell and spatial transcriptomics sequencing (stRNA-seq) data. We have updated the LnCeCell 2.0 database with significantly expanded data and improved features, including (i) 257 single-cell RNA sequencing and stRNA-seq datasets across 86 diseases/phenotypes and 80 human normal tissues, (ii) 836 581 cell-specific and spatial spot-specific ceRNA interactions and functional networks for 1 002 988 cells and 367 971 spatial spots, (iii) 15 489 experimentally supported lncRNA biomarkers related to disease pathology, diagnosis and treatment, (iv) detailed annotation of cell type, cell state, subcellular and extracellular locations of ceRNAs through manual curation and (v) ceRNA expression profiles and follow-up clinical information of 20 326 cancer patients. Further, a panel of 24 flexible tools (including 8 comprehensive and 16 mini-analysis tools) was developed to investigate ceRNA-regulated mechanisms at single-cell/spot resolution. The CeCellTraject tool, for example, illustrates the detailed ceRNA distribution of different cell populations and explores the dynamic change of the ceRNA network along the developmental trajectory. LnCeCell 2.0 will facilitate the study of fine-tuned lncRNA-ceRNA networks with single-cell and spatial spot resolution, helping us to understand the regulatory mechanisms behind complex microbial ecosystems.
40217326	2025	Genome biology	Spatiotemporal transcriptomics reveals key gene regulation for grain yield and quality in wheat.	BACKGROUND: Cereal grain size and quality are critical agronomic traits in crop production. Wheat grain development is governed by intricate regulatory networks that require precise spatiotemporal coordination of gene expression to establish functional compartments in different cell types. RESULTS: Here, we perform a spatial transcriptomics study covering the early stages of wheat grain development, from 4 to 12 days after pollination. We classify the grain into 10 distinct cell types and identify 192 marker genes associated with them. WGCNA analysis reveals that highly expressed genes in different cell types exhibit distinct enrichment patterns, significantly influencing grain development and filling. Through co-expression and motif analyses, we identify a specific group of genes that may regulate wheat grain development, including TaABI3-B1, a transcription factor specifically expressed in the embryo and surrounding endosperm, which negatively affects embryo and grain size. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents a comprehensive spatiotemporal transcriptional dataset for understanding wheat grain development. Additionally, it identifies key genetic resources with potential applications for improving wheat yield.
35513526	2022	Nature biotechnology	DIALOGUE maps multicellular programs in tissue from single-cell or spatial transcriptomics data.	Deciphering the functional interactions of cells in tissues remains a major challenge. Here we describe DIALOGUE, a method to systematically uncover multicellular programs (MCPs)-combinations of coordinated cellular programs in different cell types that form higher-order functional units at the tissue level-from either spatial data or single-cell data obtained without spatial information. Tested on spatial datasets from the mouse hypothalamus, cerebellum, visual cortex and neocortex, DIALOGUE identified MCPs associated with animal behavior and recovered spatial properties when tested on unseen data while outperforming other methods and metrics. In spatial data from human lung cancer, DIALOGUE identified MCPs marking immune activation and tissue remodeling. Applied to single-cell RNA sequencing data across individuals or regions, DIALOGUE uncovered MCPs marking Alzheimer's disease, ulcerative colitis and resistance to cancer immunotherapy. These programs were predictive of disease outcome and predisposition in independent cohorts and included risk genes from genome-wide association studies. DIALOGUE enables the analysis of multicellular regulation in health and disease.
40052440	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	MAEST: accurately spatial domain detection in spatial transcriptomics with graph masked autoencoder.	Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technology provides gene expression profiles with spatial context, offering critical insights into cellular interactions and tissue architecture. A core task in ST is spatial domain identification, which involves detecting coherent regions with similar spatial expression patterns. However, existing methods often fail to fully exploit spatial information, leading to limited representational capacity and suboptimal clustering accuracy. Here, we introduce MAEST, a novel graph neural network model designed to address these limitations in ST data. MAEST leverages graph masked autoencoders to denoise and refine representations while incorporating graph contrastive learning to prevent feature collapse and enhance model robustness. By integrating one-hop and multi-hop representations, MAEST effectively captures both local and global spatial relationships, improving clustering precision. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets, including the human brain, mouse hippocampus, olfactory bulb, brain, and embryo, demonstrate that MAEST outperforms seven state-of-the-art methods in spatial domain identification. Furthermore, MAEST showcases its ability to integrate multi-slice data, identifying joint domains across horizontal tissue sections with high accuracy. These results highlight MAEST's versatility and effectiveness in unraveling the spatial organization of complex tissues. The source code of MAEST can be obtained at https://github.com/clearlove2333/MAEST.
40545244	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Fusion of spatiotemporal and network models to prioritize multiscale effects in single-cell perturbations.	Understanding how cells respond to biological perturbations over time and across tissues is key to identifying regulators and networks that inform personalized medicine. Current methods struggle to quantify these dynamic influences in complex multicellular or multitissue systems, especially using single-cell data with spatial and temporal resolution. To address this, we introduce Perturb-STNet, a novel framework that leverages network-based spatiotemporal models to rank spatial and temporal differentially expressed regulators due to perturbation (pSTDERs) driving developmental and disease processes. Perturb-STNet identifies significant pSTDERs, estimates dynamic regulatory networks, and provides detailed visualizations of regulator, cell, and neighborhood interactions critical for understanding disease progression and therapeutic responses. We validated Perturb-STNet using synthetic data and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition lung cancer data, showing superior performance compared to standard methods. Additionally, we applied it to CODEX single-cell imaging temporal data from a murine melanoma model to study CD8+ T-cell therapy effects, and to MERFISH spatial transcriptomics temporal data to explore inflammation and tissue repair in colitis. In melanoma, Perturb-STNet uncovered regulators like KLRG1 and CD79b, along with mediating pairs and triples (IgD-H2kb, PDL1-H2kb, NKP46-CD117, and FOXP3-CD5-CD25), revealing therapeutic strategies including checkpoint inhibition by targeting PDL1-H2kb to restore CD8+ T cell function, Treg depletion through inhibition of FOXP3-CD5-CD25 axis, and NK cell activation by enhancing NKP46-CD117 interactions. In colitis, Perturb-STNet identified key genes (Csf1r, Col6a1, Lgr4, Myc, and Fzd5) and mediator pairs (Itga5-Flnc, Cd68-Csf1r, Csf1r-Cx3cl1, and Tnfrsf1b-Bmp1) involved in immune regulation, matrix remodeling, and epithelial repair, offering potential therapeutic targets. Overall, Perturb-STNet enables robust identification of spatiotemporal regulatory networks in single-cell perturbation data across diverse disease contexts.
34390577	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	A cross-level information transmission network for hierarchical omics data integration and phenotype prediction from a new genotype.	MOTIVATION: An unsolved fundamental problem in biology is to predict phenotypes from a new genotype under environmental perturbations. The emergence of multiple omics data provides new opportunities but imposes great challenges in the predictive modeling of genotype-phenotype associations. Firstly, the high-dimensionality of genomics data and the lack of coherent labeled data often make the existing supervised learning techniques less successful. Secondly, it is challenging to integrate heterogeneous omics data from different resources. Finally, few works have explicitly modeled the information transmission from DNA to phenotype, which involves multiple intermediate molecular types. Higher-level features (e.g. gene expression) usually have stronger discriminative and interpretable power than lower-level features (e.g. somatic mutation). RESULTS: We propose a novel Cross-LEvel Information Transmission (CLEIT) network framework to address the above issues. CLEIT aims to represent the asymmetrical multi-level organization of the biological system by integrating multiple incoherent omics data and to improve the prediction power of low-level features. CLEIT first learns the latent representation of the high-level domain then uses it as ground-truth embedding to improve the representation learning of the low-level domain in the form of contrastive loss. Besides, CLEIT can leverage the unlabeled heterogeneous omics data to improve the generalizability of the predictive model. We demonstrate the effectiveness and significant performance boost of CLEIT in predicting anti-cancer drug sensitivity from somatic mutations via the assistance of gene expressions when compared with state-of-the-art methods. CLEIT provides a general framework to model information transmissions and integrate multi-modal data in a multi-level system. AVAILABILITYAND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code is freely available at https://github.com/XieResearchGroup/CLEIT. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
37220897	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	gExcite: a start-to-end framework for single-cell gene expression, hashing, and antibody analysis.	SUMMARY: Recently, CITE-seq emerged as a multimodal single-cell technology capturing gene expression and surface protein information from the same single cells, which allows unprecedented insights into disease mechanisms and heterogeneity, as well as immune cell profiling. Multiple single-cell profiling methods exist, but they are typically focused on either gene expression or antibody analysis, not their combination. Moreover, existing software suites are not easily scalable to a multitude of samples. To this end, we designed gExcite, a start-to-end workflow that provides both gene and antibody expression analysis, as well as hashing deconvolution. Embedded in the Snakemake workflow manager, gExcite facilitates reproducible and scalable analyses. We showcase the output of gExcite on a study of different dissociation protocols on PBMC samples. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: gExcite is open source available on github at https://github.com/ETH-NEXUS/gExcite_pipeline. The software is distributed under the GNU General Public License 3 (GPL3).
33480403	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	DSTG: deconvoluting spatial transcriptomics data through graph-based artificial intelligence.	Recent development of spatial transcriptomics (ST) is capable of associating spatial information at different spots in the tissue section with RNA abundance of cells within each spot, which is particularly important to understand tissue cytoarchitectures and functions. However, for such ST data, since a spot is usually larger than an individual cell, gene expressions measured at each spot are from a mixture of cells with heterogenous cell types. Therefore, ST data at each spot needs to be disentangled so as to reveal the cell compositions at that spatial spot. In this study, we propose a novel method, named deconvoluting spatial transcriptomics data through graph-based convolutional networks (DSTG), to accurately deconvolute the observed gene expressions at each spot and recover its cell constitutions, thus achieving high-level segmentation and revealing spatial architecture of cellular heterogeneity within tissues. DSTG not only demonstrates superior performance on synthetic spatial data generated from different protocols, but also effectively identifies spatial compositions of cells in mouse cortex layer, hippocampus slice and pancreatic tumor tissues. In conclusion, DSTG accurately uncovers the cell states and subpopulations based on spatial localization. DSTG is available as a ready-to-use open source software (https://github.com/Su-informatics-lab/DSTG) for precise interrogation of spatial organizations and functions in tissues.

37144485	2023	Nucleic acids research	Inferring ligand-receptor cellular networks from bulk and spatial transcriptomic datasets with BulkSignalR.	The study of cellular networks mediated by ligand-receptor interactions has attracted much attention recently owing to single-cell omics. However, rich collections of bulk data accompanied with clinical information exists and continue to be generated with no equivalent in single-cell so far. In parallel, spatial transcriptomic (ST) analyses represent a revolutionary tool in biology. A large number of ST projects rely on multicellular resolution, for instance the Visium platform, where several cells are analyzed at each location, thus producing localized bulk data. Here, we describe BulkSignalR, a R package to infer ligand-receptor networks from bulk data. BulkSignalR integrates ligand-receptor interactions with downstream pathways to estimate statistical significance. A range of visualization methods complement the statistics, including functions dedicated to spatial data. We demonstrate BulkSignalR relevance using different datasets, including new Visium liver metastasis ST data, with experimental validation of protein colocalization. A comparison with other ST packages shows the significantly higher quality of BulkSignalR inferences. BulkSignalR can be applied to any species thanks to its built-in generic ortholog mapping functionality.
36410733	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Benchmarking cell-type clustering methods for spatially resolved transcriptomics data.	Spatially resolved transcriptomics technologies enable the measurement of transcriptome information while retaining the spatial context at the regional, cellular or sub-cellular level. While previous computational methods have relied on gene expression information alone for clustering single-cell populations, more recent methods have begun to leverage spatial location and histology information to improve cell clustering and cell-type identification. In this study, using seven semi-synthetic datasets with real spatial locations, simulated gene expression and histology images as well as ground truth cell-type labels, we evaluate 15 clustering methods based on clustering accuracy, robustness to data variation and input parameters, computational efficiency, and software usability. Our analysis demonstrates that even though incorporating the additional spatial and histology information leads to increased accuracy in some datasets, it does not consistently improve clustering compared with using only gene expression data. Our results indicate that for the clustering of spatial transcriptomics data, there are still opportunities to enhance the overall accuracy and robustness by improving information extraction and feature selection from spatial and histology data.
38070154	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	MMCL-CDR: enhancing cancer drug response prediction with multi-omics and morphology images contrastive representation learning.	MOTIVATION: Cancer is a complex disease that results in a significant number of global fatalities. Treatment strategies can vary among patients, even if they have the same type of cancer. The application of precision medicine in cancer shows promise for treating different types of cancer, reducing healthcare expenses, and improving recovery rates. To achieve personalized cancer treatment, machine learning models have been developed to predict drug responses based on tumor and drug characteristics. However, current studies either focus on constructing homogeneous networks from single data source or heterogeneous networks from multiomics data. While multiomics data have shown potential in predicting drug responses in cancer cell lines, there is still a lack of research that effectively utilizes insights from different modalities. Furthermore, effectively utilizing the multimodal knowledge of cancer cell lines poses a challenge due to the heterogeneity inherent in these modalities. RESULTS: To address these challenges, we introduce MMCL-CDR (Multimodal Contrastive Learning for Cancer Drug Responses), a multimodal approach for cancer drug response prediction that integrates copy number variation, gene expression, morphology images of cell lines, and chemical structure of drugs. The objective of MMCL-CDR is to align cancer cell lines across different data modalities by learning cell line representations from omic and image data, and combined with structural drug representations to enhance the prediction of cancer drug responses (CDR). We have carried out comprehensive experiments and show that our model significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in CDR prediction. The experimental results also prove that the model can learn more accurate cell line representation by integrating multiomics and morphological data from cell lines, thereby improving the accuracy of CDR prediction. In addition, the ablation study and qualitative analysis also confirm the effectiveness of each part of our proposed model. Last but not least, MMCL-CDR opens up a new dimension for cancer drug response prediction through multimodal contrastive learning, pioneering a novel approach that integrates multiomics and multimodal drug and cell line modeling. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: MMCL-CDR is available at https://github.com/catly/MMCL-CDR.
39680906	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	CrossIsoFun: predicting isoform functions using the integration of multi-omics data.	MOTIVATION: Isoforms spliced from the same gene may carry distinct biological functions. Therefore, annotating functions at the isoform level provides valuable insights into the functional diversity of genomes. Since experimental approaches for determining isoform functions are time- and cost-demanding, computational methods have been proposed. In this case, multi-omics data integration helps enhance the model performance, providing complementary insights for isoform functions. However, current methods underperform in leveraging diverse omics data, primarily due to the limited power to integrate the heterogeneous feature domains. Besides, among the multi-omics data, isoform-isoform interactions (IIIs) are a key data source, as isoforms interact with each other to perform functions. Unfortunately, IIIs remain largely underutilized in isoform function predictions until now. RESULTS: We introduce CrossIsoFun, a multi-omics data analysis framework for isoform function prediction. CrossIsoFun combines omics-specific and cross-omics learning for data integration and function prediction. In detail, CrossIsoFun uses a graph convolutional network (GCN) as the omics-specific classifier for each data source. The initial label predictions from GCNs are forwarded to the View Correlation Discovery Network (VCDN) and processed as a cross-omics integrative representation. The representation is then used to produce final predictions of isoform functions. In addition, an antoencoder within a cycle-consistency generative adversarial network (cycleGAN) is designed to generate IIIs from PPIs and thereby enrich the interactomics data. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three tissue-naive datasets and 15 tissue-specific datasets with mRNA expression, sequence, and PPI data. The prediction of CrossIsoFun is further validated by its consistency with subcellular localization and isoform-level annotations with literature support. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: CrossIsoFun is freely available at https://github.com/genemine/CrossIsoFun.

37870433	2024	Nucleic acids research	HALL: a comprehensive database for human aging and longevity studies.	Diverse individuals age at different rates and display variable susceptibilities to tissue aging, functional decline and aging-related diseases. Centenarians, exemplifying extreme longevity, serve as models for healthy aging. The field of human aging and longevity research is rapidly advancing, garnering significant attention and accumulating substantial data in recent years. Omics technologies, encompassing phenomics, genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and microbiomics, have provided multidimensional insights and revolutionized cohort-based investigations into human aging and longevity. Accumulated data, covering diverse cells, tissues and cohorts across the lifespan necessitates the establishment of an open and integrated database. Addressing this, we established the Human Aging and Longevity Landscape (HALL), a comprehensive multi-omics repository encompassing a diverse spectrum of human cohorts, spanning from young adults to centenarians. The core objective of HALL is to foster healthy aging by offering an extensive repository of information on biomarkers that gauge the trajectory of human aging. Moreover, the database facilitates the development of diagnostic tools for aging-related conditions and empowers targeted interventions to enhance longevity. HALL is publicly available at https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/hall/index.
28414750	2017	PLoS computational biology	Effect of transcription factor resource sharing on gene expression noise.	Gene expression is intrinsically a stochastic (noisy) process with important implications for cellular functions. Deciphering the underlying mechanisms of gene expression noise remains one of the key challenges of regulatory biology. Theoretical models of transcription often incorporate the kinetics of how transcription factors (TFs) interact with a single promoter to impact gene expression noise. However, inside single cells multiple identical gene copies as well as additional binding sites can compete for a limiting pool of TFs. Here we develop a simple kinetic model of transcription, which explicitly incorporates this interplay between TF copy number and its binding sites. We show that TF sharing enhances noise in mRNA distribution across an isogenic population of cells. Moreover, when a single gene copy shares it's TFs with multiple competitor sites, the mRNA variance as a function of the mean remains unaltered by their presence. Hence, all the data for variance as a function of mean expression collapse onto a single master curve independent of the strength and number of competitor sites. However, this result does not hold true when the competition stems from multiple copies of the same gene. Therefore, although previous studies showed that the mean expression follows a universal master curve, our findings suggest that different scenarios of competition bear distinct signatures at the level of variance. Intriguingly, the introduction of competitor sites can transform a unimodal mRNA distribution into a multimodal distribution. These results demonstrate the impact of limited availability of TF resource on the regulation of noise in gene expression.
28679163	2018	Briefings in bioinformatics	Network approaches to systems biology analysis of complex disease: integrative methods for multi-omics data.	In the past decade, significant progress has been made in complex disease research across multiple omics layers from genome, transcriptome and proteome to metabolome. There is an increasing awareness of the importance of biological interconnections, and much success has been achieved using systems biology approaches. However, because of the typical focus on one single omics layer at a time, existing systems biology findings explain only a modest portion of complex disease. Recent advances in multi-omics data collection and sharing present us new opportunities for studying complex diseases in a more comprehensive fashion, and yet simultaneously create new challenges considering the unprecedented data dimensionality and diversity. Here, our goal is to review extant and emerging network approaches that can be applied across multiple biological layers to facilitate a more comprehensive and integrative multilayered omics analysis of complex diseases.
40874816	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	MuST: multiple-modality structure transformation for single-cell spatial transcriptomics.	Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies have revolutionized the study of gene expression patterns in tissues by providing multimodal data, including transcriptomic (Tra.), spatial, and morphological modalities, thereby offering new opportunities to understand tissue biology beyond traditional Tra. However, we identify the modality bias phenomenon in ST data species, i.e. the inconsistent contribution of different modalities to the labels leads to a tendency for the analysis methods to retain the information of the dominant modality. How to mitigate the adverse effects of modality bias to satisfy various downstream tasks remains a fundamental challenge. This paper introduces Multiple-modality Structure Transformation, named MuST, a novel methodology to tackle the challenge. MuST integrates the multi-modality information contained in the ST data effectively into a uniform latent space to provide a foundation for all the downstream tasks. It learns intrinsic local structures by topology discovery strategy and topology fusion loss function to solve the inconsistencies among different modalities. Thus, these topology-based and deep learning techniques provide a solid foundation for a variety of analytical tasks while coordinating different modalities. The effectiveness of MuST is assessed by performance metrics and biological significance. The results show that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods with clear advantages in the precision of identifying and preserving structures of tissues and biomarkers. MuST offers a versatile toolkit for the intricate analysis of complex biological systems.
39407016	2024	Nature methods	Interpretable spatially aware dimension reduction of spatial transcriptomics with STAMP.	Spatial transcriptomics produces high-dimensional gene expression measurements with spatial context. Obtaining a biologically meaningful low-dimensional representation of such data is crucial for effective interpretation and downstream analysis. Here, we present Spatial Transcriptomics Analysis with topic Modeling to uncover spatial Patterns (STAMP), an interpretable spatially aware dimension reduction method built on a deep generative model that returns biologically relevant, low-dimensional spatial topics and associated gene modules. STAMP can analyze data ranging from a single section to multiple sections and from different technologies to time-series data, returning topics matching known biological domains and associated gene modules containing established markers highly ranked within. In a lung cancer sample, STAMP delineated cell states with supporting markers at a higher resolution than the original annotation and uncovered cancer-associated fibroblasts concentrated on the tumor edge's exterior. In time-series data of mouse embryonic development, STAMP disentangled the erythro-myeloid hematopoiesis and hepatocytes developmental trajectories within the liver. STAMP is highly scalable and can handle more than 500,000 cells.
37169965	2024	Nature biotechnology	Comparative analysis of cell-cell communication at single-cell resolution.	Inference of cell-cell communication from single-cell RNA sequencing data is a powerful technique to uncover intercellular communication pathways, yet existing methods perform this analysis at the level of the cell type or cluster, discarding single-cell-level information. Here we present Scriabin, a flexible and scalable framework for comparative analysis of cell-cell communication at single-cell resolution that is performed without cell aggregation or downsampling. We use multiple published atlas-scale datasets, genetic perturbation screens and direct experimental validation to show that Scriabin accurately recovers expected cell-cell communication edges and identifies communication networks that can be obscured by agglomerative methods. Additionally, we use spatial transcriptomic data to show that Scriabin can uncover spatial features of interaction from dissociated data alone. Finally, we demonstrate applications to longitudinal datasets to follow communication pathways operating between timepoints. Our approach represents a broadly applicable strategy to reveal the full structure of niche-phenotype relationships in health and disease.
40670711	2025	Nature biotechnology	Topological velocity inference from spatial transcriptomic data.	Incorporating space and time into models of cell fate transition will be a key step toward characterizing how interactions among neighboring cells, local niche factors and cell migration contribute to tissue development. Here we propose Topological Velocity Inference (TopoVelo), a model for jointly inferring spatial and temporal dynamics of cell fate transition from spatial transcriptomic data. TopoVelo extends the RNA velocity framework to model single-cell gene expression dynamics of an entire tissue with spatially coupled differential equations. TopoVelo estimates cell velocity from developing mouse cerebral cortex, learns interpretable spatial cell state dependencies that correlate with the expression of ligand-receptor genes and reveals spatial signatures of mouse neural tube closure. Finally, we generate Slide-seq data from an in vitro model of human development and use TopoVelo to study the spatial patterns of early differentiation. Our work introduces a new dimension into the study of cell fate transitions and lays a foundation for modeling the collective dynamics of cells comprising an entire tissue.
38978101	2024	Genome biology	Detection of allele-specific expression in spatial transcriptomics with spASE.	Spatial transcriptomics technologies permit the study of the spatial distribution of RNA at near-single-cell resolution genome-wide. However, the feasibility of studying spatial allele-specific expression (ASE) from these data remains uncharacterized. Here, we introduce spASE, a computational framework for detecting and estimating spatial ASE. To tackle the challenges presented by cell type mixtures and a low signal to noise ratio, we implement a hierarchical model involving additive mixtures of spatial smoothing splines. We apply our method to allele-resolved Visium and Slide-seq from the mouse cerebellum and hippocampus and report new insight into the landscape of spatial and cell type-specific ASE therein.
39988678	2025	Genome biology	Transposable elements may enhance antiviral resistance in HIV-1 elite controllers.	BACKGROUND: Less than 0.5% of people living with HIV-1 are elite controllers (ECs)-individuals who maintain undetectable plasma viremia without antiretroviral therapy, despite having replication-competent viral reservoirs. While EC CD4(+) T cells have been investigated for gene expression signatures associated with HIV-1 resistance, the expression and regulatory activity of transposable elements (TEs) remain unexplored. TEs can directly impact host immune responses to pathogens, including HIV-1, suggesting their activities could contribute to HIV-1 elite control. To begin testing this hypothesis, we conduct a TE-centric analysis of public multi-omics data from ECs and other populations. RESULTS: We find the CD4(+) T cell transcriptome and retrotranscriptome of ECs are distinct from healthy controls, from people living with HIV-1 on antiretroviral therapy, and from viremic progressors. However, there is substantial transcriptomic heterogeneity among ECs. We categorize ECs into four clusters with distinct expression and chromatin accessibility profiles of TEs and antiviral factors. Several TE families with known immuno-regulatory activity are differentially expressed among ECs. Their expression positively correlates with their chromatin accessibility in ECs and negatively correlates with the expression of their KRAB zinc-finger (KZNF) repressors. This coordinated, locus-level variation forms a network of putative cis-regulatory elements for genes involved in HIV-1 restriction. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that the EC phenotype is driven in part by reduced KZNF-mediated repression of specific TE-derived cis-regulatory elements for antiviral genes, heightening their resistance against HIV-1. Our study reveals heterogeneity in the EC CD4(+) T cell transcriptome, including variable expression of TEs and their KZNF controllers, that must be considered when deciphering HIV-1 control mechanisms.
38217002	2024	Genome biology	Niche-DE: niche-differential gene expression analysis in spatial transcriptomics data identifies context-dependent cell-cell interactions.	Existing methods for analysis of spatial transcriptomic data focus on delineating the global gene expression variations of cell types across the tissue, rather than local gene expression changes driven by cell-cell interactions. We propose a new statistical procedure called niche-differential expression (niche-DE) analysis that identifies cell-type-specific niche-associated genes, which are differentially expressed within a specific cell type in the context of specific spatial niches. We further develop niche-LR, a method to reveal ligand-receptor signaling mechanisms that underlie niche-differential gene expression patterns. Niche-DE and niche-LR are applicable to low-resolution spot-based spatial transcriptomics data and data that is single-cell or subcellular in resolution.
39526396	2025	Nucleic acids research	scProAtlas: an atlas of multiplexed single-cell spatial proteomics imaging in human tissues.	Spatial proteomics can visualize and quantify protein expression profiles within tissues at single-cell resolution. Although spatial proteomics can only detect a limited number of proteins compared to spatial transcriptomics, it provides comprehensive spatial information with single-cell resolution. By studying the spatial distribution of cells, we can clearly obtain the spatial context within tissues at multiple scales. Spatial context includes the spatial composition of cell types, the distribution of functional structures, and the spatial communication between functional regions, all of which are crucial for the patterns of cellular distribution. Here, we constructed a comprehensive spatial proteomics functional annotation knowledgebase, scProAtlas (https://relab.xidian.edu.cn/scProAtlas/#/), which is designed to help users comprehensively understand the spatial context within different tissue types at single-cell resolution and across multiple scales. scProAtlas contains multiple modules, including neighborhood analysis, proximity analysis and neighborhood network, to comprehensively construct spatial cell maps of tissues and multi-modal integration, spatial gene identification, cell-cell interaction and spatial pathway analysis to display spatial variable genes. scProAtlas includes data from eight spatial protein imaging techniques across 15 tissues and provides detailed functional annotation information for 17 468 394 cells from 945 region of interests. The aim of scProAtlas is to offer a new insight into the spatial structure of various tissues and provides detailed spatial functional annotation.
37930842	2024	Nucleic acids research	SCAN: Spatiotemporal Cloud Atlas for Neural cells.	The nervous system is one of the most complicated and enigmatic systems within the animal kingdom. Recently, the emergence and development of spatial transcriptomics (ST) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have provided an unprecedented ability to systematically decipher the cellular heterogeneity and spatial locations of the nervous system from multiple unbiased aspects. However, efficiently integrating, presenting and analyzing massive multiomic data remains a huge challenge. Here, we manually collected and comprehensively analyzed high-quality scRNA-seq and ST data from the nervous system, covering 10 679 684 cells. In addition, multi-omic datasets from more than 900 species were included for extensive data mining from an evolutionary perspective. Furthermore, over 100 neurological diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Down syndrome) were systematically analyzed for high-throughput screening of putative biomarkers. Differential expression patterns across developmental time points, cell types and ST spots were discerned and subsequently subjected to extensive interpretation. To provide researchers with efficient data exploration, we created a new database with interactive interfaces and integrated functions called the Spatiotemporal Cloud Atlas for Neural cells (SCAN), freely accessible at http://47.98.139.124:8799 or http://scanatlas.net. SCAN will benefit the neuroscience research community to better exploit the spatiotemporal atlas of the neural system and promote the development of diagnostic strategies for various neurological disorders.
35043939	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Identify, quantify and characterize cellular communication from single-cell RNA sequencing data with scSeqComm.	MOTIVATION: Recently, single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data have been used to study cellular communication. Most bioinformatics methods infer only the intercellular signaling between groups of cells, mainly exploiting ligand-receptor expression levels. Only few methods consider the entire intercellular + intracellular signaling, mainly inferring lists/networks of signaling involved genes. RESULTS: Here, we present scSeqComm, a computational method to identify and quantify the evidence of ongoing intercellular and intracellular signaling from scRNA-seq data, and at the same time providing a functional characterization of the inferred cellular communication. The possibility to quantify the evidence of ongoing communication assists the prioritization of the results, while the combined evidence of both intercellular and intracellular signaling increase the reliability of inferred communication. The application to a scRNA-seq dataset of tumor microenvironment, the agreement with independent bioinformatics analysis, the validation using spatial transcriptomics data and the comparison with state-of-the-art intercellular scoring schemes confirmed the robustness and reliability of the proposed method. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: scSeqComm R package is freely available at https://gitlab.com/sysbiobig/scseqcomm and https://sysbiobig.dei.unipd.it/software/#scSeqComm. Submitted software version and test data are available in Zenodo, at https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5833298. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
30535348	2019	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	DensityPath: an algorithm to visualize and reconstruct cell state-transition path on density landscape for single-cell RNA sequencing data.	MOTIVATION: Visualizing and reconstructing cell developmental trajectories intrinsically embedded in high-dimensional expression profiles of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) snapshot data are computationally intriguing, but challenging. RESULTS: We propose DensityPath, an algorithm allowing (i) visualization of the intrinsic structure of scRNA-seq data on an embedded 2-d space and (ii) reconstruction of an optimal cell state-transition path on the density landscape. DensityPath powerfully handles high dimensionality and heterogeneity of scRNA-seq data by (i) revealing the intrinsic structures of data, while adopting a non-linear dimension reduction algorithm, termed elastic embedding, which can preserve both local and global structures of the data; and (ii) extracting the topological features of high-density, level-set clusters from a single-cell multimodal density landscape of transcriptional heterogeneity, as the representative cell states. DensityPath reconstructs the optimal cell state-transition path by finding the geodesic minimum spanning tree of representative cell states on the density landscape, establishing a least action path with the minimum-transition-energy of cell fate decisions. We demonstrate that DensityPath can ably reconstruct complex trajectories of cell development, e.g. those with multiple bifurcating and trifurcating branches, while maintaining computational efficiency. Moreover, DensityPath has high accuracy for pseudotime calculation and branch assignment on real scRNA-seq, as well as simulated datasets. DensityPath is robust to parameter choices, as well as permutations of data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: DensityPath software is available at https://github.com/ucasdp/DensityPath. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
40001084	2025	Genome biology	Batch correcting single-cell spatial transcriptomics count data with Crescendo improves visualization and detection of spatial gene patterns.	Spatial transcriptomics facilitates gene expression analysis of cells in their spatial anatomical context. Batch effects hinder visualization of gene spatial patterns across samples. We present the Crescendo algorithm to correct for batch effects at the gene expression level and enable accurate visualization of gene expression patterns across multiple samples. We show Crescendo's utility and scalability across three datasets ranging from 170,000 to 7 million single cells across spatial and single-cell RNA sequencing technologies. By correcting for batch effects, Crescendo enhances spatial transcriptomics analyses to detect gene colocalization and ligand-receptor interactions and enables cross-technology information transfer.
36109677	2022	Nature methods	ISSAAC-seq enables sensitive and flexible multimodal profiling of chromatin accessibility and gene expression in single cells.	Joint profiling of chromatin accessibility and gene expression from the same single cell provides critical information about cell types in a tissue and cell states during a dynamic process. Here, we develop in situ sequencing hetero RNA-DNA-hybrid after assay for transposase-accessible chromatin-sequencing (ISSAAC-seq), a highly sensitive and flexible single-cell multi-omics method to interrogate chromatin accessibility and gene expression from the same single nucleus. We demonstrated that ISSAAC-seq is sensitive and provides high quality data with orders of magnitude more features than existing methods. Using the joint profiles from over 10,000 nuclei from the mouse cerebral cortex, we uncovered major and rare cell types and cell-type specific regulatory elements and identified heterogeneity at the chromatin level within established cell types defined by gene expression. Finally, we revealed distinct dynamics and relationships of gene expression and chromatin accessibility during an oligodendrocyte maturation trajectory.
36163261	2022	Genome biology	Single-cell multi-omics profiling links dynamic DNA methylation to cell fate decisions during mouse early organogenesis.	BACKGROUND: Perturbation of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and of the active DNA demethylation pathway via ten-eleven translocation (TET) methylcytosine dioxygenases results in severe developmental defects and embryonic lethality. Dynamic control of DNA methylation is therefore vital for embryogenesis, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. RESULTS: Here we report a single-cell transcriptomic atlas from Dnmt and Tet mutant mouse embryos during early organogenesis. We show that both the maintenance and de novo methyltransferase enzymes are dispensable for the formation of all major cell types at E8.5. However, DNA methyltransferases are required for silencing of prior or alternative cell fates such as pluripotency and extraembryonic programmes. Deletion of all three TET enzymes produces substantial lineage biases, in particular, a failure to generate primitive erythrocytes. Single-cell multi-omics profiling moreover reveals that this is linked to a failure to demethylate distal regulatory elements in Tet triple-knockout embryos. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a detailed analysis of the effects of perturbing DNA methylation on mouse organogenesis at a whole organism scale and affords new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of cell fate decisions.
39350302	2024	Genome biology	Characterization of regeneration initiating cells during Xenopus laevis tail regeneration.	BACKGROUND: Embryos are regeneration and wound healing masters. They rapidly close wounds and scarlessly remodel and regenerate injured tissue. Regeneration has been extensively studied in many animal models using new tools such as single-cell analysis. However, until now, they have been based primarily on experiments assessing from 1 day post injury. RESULTS: In this paper, we reveal that critical steps initiating regeneration occur within hours after injury. We discovered the regeneration initiating cells (RICs) using single-cell and spatial transcriptomics of the regenerating Xenopus laevis tail. RICs are formed transiently from the basal epidermal cells, and their expression signature suggests they are important for modifying the surrounding extracellular matrix thus regulating development. The absence or deregulation of RICs leads to excessive extracellular matrix deposition and defective regeneration. CONCLUSION: RICs represent a newly discovered transient cell state involved in the initiation of the regeneration process.
40495257	2025	Genome biology	Integration of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics by SEU-TCA reveals the spatial origin of early cardiac progenitors.	Obtaining single-cell spatial information remains a challenge in spatial transcriptomics. Here we develop SEU-TCA, a method that leverages transfer component analysis to improve single-cell spatial mapping accuracy. Application to multiple single-cell and spatial transcriptomic datasets shows superior performance in spatial deconvolution and cell mapping. Using SEU-TCA, we explore spatial gene expression and regulon activity during mouse gastrulation and identify anterior second heart field progenitors regulated by Irx1. Functional experiments reveal that Irx1 deletion disrupts anterior second heart field development and causes ventricular septal defects, underscoring SEU-TCA's potential for advancing developmental biology research.
39529142	2024	Genome biology	IAMSAM: image-based analysis of molecular signatures using the Segment Anything Model.	Spatial transcriptomics is a cutting-edge technique that combines gene expression with spatial information, allowing researchers to study molecular patterns within tissue architecture. Here, we present IAMSAM, a user-friendly web-based tool for analyzing spatial transcriptomics data focusing on morphological features. IAMSAM accurately segments tissue images using the Segment Anything Model, allowing for the semi-automatic selection of regions of interest based on morphological signatures. Furthermore, IAMSAM provides downstream analysis, such as identifying differentially expressed genes, enrichment analysis, and cell type prediction within the selected regions. With its simple interface, IAMSAM empowers researchers to explore and interpret heterogeneous tissues in a streamlined manner.
38822412	2024	Genome biology	Sequential drug treatment targeting cell cycle and cell fate regulatory programs blocks non-genetic cancer evolution in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	BACKGROUND: Targeted therapies exploiting vulnerabilities of cancer cells hold promise for improving patient outcome and reducing side-effects of chemotherapy. However, efficacy of precision therapies is limited in part because of tumor cell heterogeneity. A better mechanistic understanding of how drug effect is linked to cancer cell state diversity is crucial for identifying effective combination therapies that can prevent disease recurrence. RESULTS: Here, we characterize the effect of G2/M checkpoint inhibition in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and demonstrate that WEE1 targeted therapy impinges on cell fate decision regulatory circuits. We find the highest inhibition of recovery of proliferation in ALL cells with KMT2A-rearrangements. Single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq of RS4;11 cells harboring KMT2A::AFF1, treated with the WEE1 inhibitor AZD1775, reveal diversification of cell states, with a fraction of cells exhibiting strong activation of p53-driven processes linked to apoptosis and senescence, and disruption of a core KMT2A-RUNX1-MYC regulatory network. In this cell state diversification induced by WEE1 inhibition, a subpopulation transitions to a drug tolerant cell state characterized by activation of transcription factors regulating pre-B cell fate, lipid metabolism, and pre-BCR signaling in a reversible manner. Sequential treatment with BCR-signaling inhibitors dasatinib, ibrutinib, or perturbing metabolism by fatostatin or AZD2014 effectively counteracts drug tolerance by inducing cell death and repressing stemness markers. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our findings provide new insights into the tight connectivity of gene regulatory programs associated with cell cycle and cell fate regulation, and a rationale for sequential administration of WEE1 inhibitors with low toxicity inhibitors of pre-BCR signaling or metabolism.
31756191	2019	PLoS computational biology	Clustering-independent analysis of genomic data using spectral simplicial theory.	The prevailing paradigm for the analysis of biological data involves comparing groups of replicates from different conditions (e.g. control and treatment) to statistically infer features that discriminate them (e.g. differentially expressed genes). However, many situations in modern genomics such as single-cell omics experiments do not fit well into this paradigm because they lack true replicates. In such instances, spectral techniques could be used to rank features according to their degree of consistency with an underlying metric structure without the need to cluster samples. Here, we extend spectral methods for feature selection to abstract simplicial complexes and present a general framework for clustering-independent analysis. Combinatorial Laplacian scores take into account the topology spanned by the data and reduce to the ordinary Laplacian score when restricted to graphs. We demonstrate the utility of this framework with several applications to the analysis of gene expression and multi-modal genomic data. Specifically, we perform differential expression analysis in situations where samples cannot be grouped into distinct classes, and we disaggregate differentially expressed genes according to the topology of the expression space (e.g. alternative paths of differentiation). We also apply this formalism to identify genes with spatial patterns of expression using fluorescence in-situ hybridization data and to establish associations between genetic alterations and global expression patterns in large cross-sectional studies. Our results provide a unifying perspective on topological data analysis and manifold learning approaches to the analysis of large-scale biological datasets.
40404994	2025	Nature methods	Cell simulation as cell segmentation.	Single-cell spatial transcriptomics promises a highly detailed view of a cell's transcriptional state and microenvironment, yet inaccurate cell segmentation can render these data murky by misattributing large numbers of transcripts to nearby cells or conjuring nonexistent cells. We adopt methods from ab initio cell simulation, in a method called Proseg (probabilistic segmentation), to rapidly infer morphologically plausible cell boundaries. Benchmarking applied to datasets generated by three commercial platforms shows superior performance and computational efficiency of Proseg when compared to existing methods. We show that improved accuracy in cell segmentation aids greatly in detection of difficult-to-segment tumor-infiltrating immune cells such as neutrophils and T cells. Last, through improvements in our ability to delineate subsets of tumor-infiltrating T cells, we show that CXCL13-expressing CD8(+) T cells tend to be more closely associated with tumor cells than their CXCL13-negative counterparts in data generated from samples from patients with renal cell carcinoma.
29553578	2018	Nature methods	Identification of spatial expression trends in single-cell gene expression data.	As methods for measuring spatial gene expression at single-cell resolution become available, there is a need for computational analysis strategies. We present trendsceek, a method based on marked point processes that identifies genes with statistically significant spatial expression trends. trendsceek finds these genes in spatial transcriptomic and sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization data, and also reveals significant gene expression gradients and hot spots in low-dimensional projections of dissociated single-cell RNA-seq data.
31937348	2020	Genome biology	DENDRO: genetic heterogeneity profiling and subclone detection by single-cell RNA sequencing.	Although scRNA-seq is now ubiquitously adopted in studies of intratumor heterogeneity, detection of somatic mutations and inference of clonal membership from scRNA-seq is currently unreliable. We propose DENDRO, an analysis method for scRNA-seq data that clusters single cells into genetically distinct subclones and reconstructs the phylogenetic tree relating the subclones. DENDRO utilizes transcribed point mutations and accounts for technical noise and expression stochasticity. We benchmark DENDRO and demonstrate its application on simulation data and real data from three cancer types. In particular, on a mouse melanoma model in response to immunotherapy, DENDRO delineates the role of neoantigens in treatment response.
38678387	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	CPPLS-MLP: a method for constructing cell-cell communication networks and identifying related highly variable genes based on single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomics data.	In the growth and development of multicellular organisms, the immune processes of the immune system and the maintenance of the organism's internal environment, cell communication plays a crucial role. It exerts a significant influence on regulating internal cellular states such as gene expression and cell functionality. Currently, the mainstream methods for studying intercellular communication are focused on exploring the ligand-receptor-transcription factor and ligand-receptor-subunit scales. However, there is relatively limited research on the association between intercellular communication and highly variable genes (HVGs). As some HVGs are closely related to cell communication, accurately identifying these HVGs can enhance the accuracy of constructing cell communication networks. The rapid development of single-cell sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics technologies provides a data foundation for exploring the relationship between intercellular communication and HVGs. Therefore, we propose CPPLS-MLP, which can identify HVGs closely related to intercellular communication and further analyze the impact of Multiple Input Multiple Output cellular communication on the differential expression of these HVGs. By comparing with the commonly used method CCPLS for constructing intercellular communication networks, we validated the superior performance of our method in identifying cell-type-specific HVGs and effectively analyzing the influence of neighboring cell types on HVG expression regulation. Source codes for the CPPLS_MLP R, python packages and the related scripts are available at 'CPPLS_MLP Github [https://github.com/wuzhenao/CPPLS-MLP]'.
40551223	2025	Genome biology	CellMemory: hierarchical interpretation of out-of-distribution cells using bottlenecked transformer.	Machine learning methods, especially Transformer architectures, have been widely employed in single-cell omics studies. However, interpretability and accurate representation of out-of-distribution (OOD) cells remains challenging. Inspired by the global workspace theory in cognitive neuroscience, we introduce CellMemory, a bottlenecked Transformer with improved generalizability designed for the hierarchical interpretation of OOD cells. Without pre-training, CellMemory outperforms existing single-cell foundation models and accurately deciphers spatial transcriptomics at high resolution. Leveraging its robust representations, we further elucidate malignant cells and their founder cells across patients, providing reliable characterizations of the cellular changes caused by the disease.
36162821	2023	Nucleic acids research	CohesinDB: a comprehensive database for decoding cohesin-related epigenomes, 3D genomes and transcriptomes in human cells.	Cohesin is a multifunctional protein responsible for transcriptional regulation and chromatin organization. Cohesin binds to chromatin at tens of thousands of distinct sites in a conserved or tissue-specific manner, whereas the function of cohesin varies greatly depending on the epigenetic properties of specific chromatin loci. Cohesin also extensively mediates cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) and chromatin loops. Even though next-generation sequencing technologies have provided a wealth of information on different aspects of cohesin, the integration and exploration of the resultant massive cohesin datasets are not straightforward. Here, we present CohesinDB (https://cohesindb.iqb.u-tokyo.ac.jp), a comprehensive multiomics cohesin database in human cells. CohesinDB includes 2043 epigenomics, transcriptomics and 3D genomics datasets from 530 studies involving 176 cell types. By integrating these large-scale data, CohesinDB summarizes three types of 'cohesin objects': 751 590 cohesin binding sites, 957 868 cohesin-related chromatin loops and 2 229 500 cohesin-related CRMs. Each cohesin object is annotated with locus, cell type, classification, function, 3D genomics and cis-regulatory information. CohesinDB features a user-friendly interface for browsing, searching, analyzing, visualizing and downloading the desired information. CohesinDB contributes a valuable resource for all researchers studying cohesin, epigenomics, transcriptional regulation and chromatin organization.
37811885	2023	Nucleic acids research	STAMarker: determining spatial domain-specific variable genes with saliency maps in deep learning.	Spatial transcriptomics characterizes gene expression profiles while retaining the information of the spatial context, providing an unprecedented opportunity to understand cellular systems. One of the essential tasks in such data analysis is to determine spatially variable genes (SVGs), which demonstrate spatial expression patterns. Existing methods only consider genes individually and fail to model the inter-dependence of genes. To this end, we present an analytic tool STAMarker for robustly determining spatial domain-specific SVGs with saliency maps in deep learning. STAMarker is a three-stage ensemble framework consisting of graph-attention autoencoders, multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifiers, and saliency map computation by the backpropagated gradient. We illustrate the effectiveness of STAMarker and compare it with serveral commonly used competing methods on various spatial transcriptomic data generated by different platforms. STAMarker considers all genes at once and is more robust when the dataset is very sparse. STAMarker could identify spatial domain-specific SVGs for characterizing spatial domains and enable in-depth analysis of the region of interest in the tissue section.
39470702	2025	Nucleic acids research	stSNV: a comprehensive resource of SNVs in spatial transcriptome.	Single nucleotide variants (SNVs), as important components of genetic variation, affect gene expression, function and phenotype. Mining and summarizing the spatial distribution of SNVs in diseased and normal tissues for a better understanding of their characteristics and potential roles in cell-lineage determination, aging, or disease occurrence is significant. Herein, we have developed a comprehensive spatial mutation resource stSNV (http://bio-bigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/stSNV/index.jsp), which provides an atlas of spatial SNVs in major diseased and normal tissues of human and mouse. stSNV documents 42 202 spatial mutated genes involving 898 908 SNVs called from 730 067 spots within 450 slices from 19 diseased and 28 normal tissues. Importantly, potential characteristics of SNVs are explored and provided by analyzing the perturbation of the SNVs to gene expression, spatial communication, biological function, region-specific mutated genes, spatial mutant signatures, SNV-cell co-localization and mutation core region. All these spatial mutation data and in-depth analyses have been integrated into a user-friendly interface, visualized through intuitive tables and various image formats. Flexible tools are developed to explore co-localization among clusters, genes, cell types and SNVs in the same slice. In summary, stSNV as a valuable resource helps to dissect intra-tissue genetic heterogeneity and lays the groundwork for understanding the SNVs' biological regulatory mechanisms.
38904542	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Advancing drug-response prediction using multi-modal and -omics machine learning integration (MOMLIN): a case study on breast cancer clinical data.	The inherent heterogeneity of cancer contributes to highly variable responses to any anticancer treatments. This underscores the need to first identify precise biomarkers through complex multi-omics datasets that are now available. Although much research has focused on this aspect, identifying biomarkers associated with distinct drug responders still remains a major challenge. Here, we develop MOMLIN, a multi-modal and -omics machine learning integration framework, to enhance drug-response prediction. MOMLIN jointly utilizes sparse correlation algorithms and class-specific feature selection algorithms, which identifies multi-modal and -omics-associated interpretable components. MOMLIN was applied to 147 patients' breast cancer datasets (clinical, mutation, gene expression, tumor microenvironment cells and molecular pathways) to analyze drug-response class predictions for non-responders and variable responders. Notably, MOMLIN achieves an average AUC of 0.989, which is at least 10% greater when compared with current state-of-the-art (data integration analysis for biomarker discovery using latent components, multi-omics factor analysis, sparse canonical correlation analysis). Moreover, MOMLIN not only detects known individual biomarkers such as genes at mutation/expression level, most importantly, it correlates multi-modal and -omics network biomarkers for each response class. For example, an interaction between ER-negative-HMCN1-COL5A1 mutations-FBXO2-CSF3R expression-CD8 emerge as a multimodal biomarker for responders, potentially affecting antimicrobial peptides and FLT3 signaling pathways. In contrast, for resistance cases, a distinct combination of lymph node-TP53 mutation-PON3-ENSG00000261116 lncRNA expression-HLA-E-T-cell exclusions emerged as multimodal biomarkers, possibly impacting neurotransmitter release cycle pathway. MOMLIN, therefore, is expected advance precision medicine, such as to detect context-specific multi-omics network biomarkers and better predict drug-response classifications.
35132261	2022	Nature biotechnology	Spatial components of molecular tissue biology.	Methods for profiling RNA and protein expression in a spatially resolved manner are rapidly evolving, making it possible to comprehensively characterize cells and tissues in health and disease. To maximize the biological insights obtained using these techniques, it is critical to both clearly articulate the key biological questions in spatial analysis of tissues and develop the requisite computational tools to address them. Developers of analytical tools need to decide on the intrinsic molecular features of each cell that need to be considered, and how cell shape and morphological features are incorporated into the analysis. Also, optimal ways to compare different tissue samples at various length scales are still being sought. Grouping these biological problems and related computational algorithms into classes across length scales, thus characterizing common issues that need to be addressed, will facilitate further progress in spatial transcriptomics and proteomics.
37726147	2023	Genome research	Spatial transcriptomics reveals asymmetric cellular responses to injury in the regenerating spiny mouse (Acomys) ear.	In contrast to other mammals, the spiny mouse (Acomys) regenerates skin and ear tissue, which includes hair follicles, glands, and cartilage, in a scar-free manner. Ear punch regeneration is asymmetric with only the proximal wound side participating in regeneration. Here, we show that cues originating from the proximal side are required for normal regeneration and use spatially resolved transcriptomics (tomo-seq) to understand the molecular and cellular events underlying this process. Analyzing gene expression across the ear and comparing expression modules between proximal and distal wound sides, we identify asymmetric gene expression patterns and pinpoint regenerative processes in space and time. Moreover, using a comparative approach with nonregenerative rodents (Mus, Meriones), we strengthen a hypothesis in which particularities in the injury-induced immune response may be one of the crucial determinants for why spiny mice regenerate whereas their relatives do not. Our data are available in SpinyMine, an easy-to-use and expandable web-based tool for exploring Acomys regeneration-associated gene expression.

A key challenge is generating interpretable embeddings that preserve spatial geometry while correcting batch effects. We present MaskGraphene, a graph neural network that integrates ST data via masked self-supervised learning, triplet loss, and cluster-wise local alignment. By establishing indirect ""soft-links"" and direct ""hard-links"" across slices, MaskGraphene yields joint embeddings with high geometric fidelity. Benchmarks against eight methods demonstrate superior alignment and interpretability. MaskGraphene enhances downstream applications, including domain identification, trajectory reconstruction, biomarker discovery, and brain-layer mapping, enabling robust ST integration and biological insight."
41313603	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Integrating explainable artificial intelligence with multiomics systems biology and electronic health record data mining for personalized drug repurposing in Alzheimer's disease.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by region- and patient-specific molecular heterogeneity, which hinders therapeutic design. In this study, we introduce PRISM-ML (PRecision-medicine using Interpretable Systems and Multiomics with Machine Learning), an open-source integrated analysis pipeline that combines interpretable machine learning with systems biology and electronic health records data mining to elucidate the molecular diversity of AD and predict promising drug repurposing opportunities. First, we integrated and harmonized transcriptomic (bulk RNA-seq) and genomic (genome-wide association study) data from 2105 brain samples, each with matched data from the same individual (1363 AD patients, 742 controls; 9 tissues), sourced from three independent studies. Random forest classifiers with SHapley Additive exPlanations identified patient-specific biomarkers; unsupervised clustering resolved 36 molecularly distinct subtissues (defined as clusters of samples within a brain tissue that share a specific expression pattern); and gene-gene coexpression networks prioritized 262 high-centrality bottleneck genes as putative regulators of dysregulated pathways. Next, knowledge graph-based drug repurposing predicted six Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs that simultaneously target multiple bottleneck genes and multiple AD-relevant pathways. Notably, in a large US de-identified insurance-claims database (n = 364 733), exposure to promethazine, one of the candidate drugs, was associated with a 57%-62% lower incidence of AD versus an active antihistamine comparator (adjusted hazard ratio 0.38; inverse-probability weighted 0.43; both P < .001), providing real-world support for its repurposing potential. In summary, PRISM-ML, as an explainable multiomics analysis pipeline, is readily transferable to other complex diseases, advancing precision medicine.
39207727	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	A single-cell multimodal view on gene regulatory network inference from transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility data.	Eukaryotic gene regulation is a combinatorial, dynamic, and quantitative process that plays a vital role in development and disease and can be modeled at a systems level in gene regulatory networks (GRNs). The wealth of multi-omics data measured on the same samples and even on the same cells has lifted the field of GRN inference to the next stage. Combinations of (single-cell) transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility allow the prediction of fine-grained regulatory programs that go beyond mere correlation of transcription factor and target gene expression, with enhancer GRNs (eGRNs) modeling molecular interactions between transcription factors, regulatory elements, and target genes. In this review, we highlight the key components for successful (e)GRN inference from (sc)RNA-seq and (sc)ATAC-seq data exemplified by state-of-the-art methods as well as open challenges and future developments. Moreover, we address preprocessing strategies, metacell generation and computational omics pairing, transcription factor binding site detection, and linear and three-dimensional approaches to identify chromatin interactions as well as dynamic and causal eGRN inference. We believe that the integration of transcriptomics together with epigenomics data at a single-cell level is the new standard for mechanistic network inference, and that it can be further advanced with integrating additional omics layers and spatiotemporal data, as well as with shifting the focus towards more quantitative and causal modeling strategies.
38641842	2024	Genome biology	Single Cell Atlas: a single-cell multi-omics human cell encyclopedia.	Single-cell sequencing datasets are key in biology and medicine for unraveling insights into heterogeneous cell populations with unprecedented resolution. Here, we construct a single-cell multi-omics map of human tissues through in-depth characterizations of datasets from five single-cell omics, spatial transcriptomics, and two bulk omics across 125 healthy adult and fetal tissues. We construct its complement web-based platform, the Single Cell Atlas (SCA, www.singlecellatlas.org ), to enable vast interactive data exploration of deep multi-omics signatures across human fetal and adult tissues. The atlas resources and database queries aspire to serve as a one-stop, comprehensive, and time-effective resource for various omics studies.
38806182	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	ReactomeGSA: new features to simplify public data reuse.	MOTIVATION: ReactomeGSA is part of the Reactome knowledgebase and one of the leading multi-omics pathway analysis platforms. ReactomeGSA provides access to quantitative pathway analysis methods supporting different 'omics data types.

38728362	2024	PLoS computational biology	Machine learning and multi-omics data reveal driver gene-based molecular subtypes in hepatocellular carcinoma for precision treatment.	The heterogeneity of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) poses a barrier to effective treatment. Stratifying highly heterogeneous HCC into molecular subtypes with similar features is crucial for personalized anti-tumor therapies. Although driver genes play pivotal roles in cancer progression, their potential in HCC subtyping has been largely overlooked. This study aims to utilize driver genes to construct HCC subtype models and unravel their molecular mechanisms. Utilizing a novel computational framework, we expanded the initially identified 96 driver genes to 1192 based on mutational aspects and an additional 233 considering driver dysregulation. These genes were subsequently employed as stratification markers for further analyses. A novel multi-omics subtype classification algorithm was developed, leveraging mutation and expression data of the identified stratification genes. This algorithm successfully categorized HCC into two distinct subtypes, CLASS A and CLASS B, demonstrating significant differences in survival outcomes. Integrating multi-omics and single-cell data unveiled substantial distinctions between these subtypes regarding transcriptomics, mutations, copy number variations, and epigenomics. Moreover, our prognostic model exhibited excellent predictive performance in training and external validation cohorts. Finally, a 10-gene classification model for these subtypes identified TTK as a promising therapeutic target with robust classification capabilities. This comprehensive study provides a novel perspective on HCC stratification, offering crucial insights for a deeper understanding of its pathogenesis and the development of promising treatment strategies.
40748322	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Artifacts in spatial transcriptomics data: their detection, importance, prevalence, and prevention.	Data artifacts may induce errors in findings from any spatial transcriptomics platform. To provide protection from these errors, we have developed Border, Location, and edge Artifact DEtection (BLADE). BLADE is a novel collection of automated cross-platform statistical methods for detecting and removing three types of artifacts: (i) border effects, where total gene reads is modified at the border of the capture area; (ii) tissue edge effects, where total gene reads is modified at the edge of the tissue; (iii) location batch malfunctions, where there is a zone in the same location on all slides in a batch with substantially decreased sequencing depth. These artifacts are not mutually exclusive. BLADE has been applied to both Visium and CosMx data, and was used to evaluate our library of 37 10x Visium samples of liver and adipose tissue from humans and mice. Artifacts were found to be both common and impactful in those samples, indicating that artifact detection methods are critical for spatial transcriptomics quality control. Our BLADE software is publicly available.
35022082	2022	Genome biology	A deep generative model for multi-view profiling of single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data.	Here, we present a multi-modal deep generative model, the single-cell Multi-View Profiler (scMVP), which is designed for handling sequencing data that simultaneously measure gene expression and chromatin accessibility in the same cell, including SNARE-seq, sci-CAR, Paired-seq, SHARE-seq, and Multiome from 10X Genomics. scMVP generates common latent representations for dimensionality reduction, cell clustering, and developmental trajectory inference and generates separate imputations for differential analysis and cis-regulatory element identification. scMVP can help mitigate data sparsity issues with imputation and accurately identify cell groups for different joint profiling techniques with common latent embedding, and we demonstrate its advantages on several realistic datasets.
39657949	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	SuperSpot: coarse graining spatial transcriptomics data into metaspots.	"SUMMARY: Spatial Transcriptomics is revolutionizing our ability to phenotypically characterize complex biological tissues and decipher cellular niches. With current technologies such as VisiumHD, thousands of genes can be detected across millions of spots (also called cells or bins depending on the technologies). Building upon the metacell concept, we present a workflow, called SuperSpot, to combine adjacent and transcriptomically similar spots into ""metaspots"". The process involves representing spots as nodes in a graph with edges connecting spots in spatial proximity and edge weights representing transcriptomic similarity. Hierarchical clustering is used to aggregate spots into metaspots at a user-defined resolution. We demonstrate that metaspots reduce the size and sparsity of spatial transcriptomic data and facilitate the analysis of large datasets generated with the most recent technologies. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: SuperSpot is an R package available at https://github.com/GfellerLab/SuperSpot and archived on Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14222088). The code to reproduce the figures is available at https://github.com/GfellerLab/SuperSpot/tree/main/figures (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14222088)."
32778869	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	A powerful framework for an integrative study with heterogeneous omics data: from univariate statistics to multi-block analysis.	High-throughput data generated by new biotechnologies require specific and adapted statistical treatment in order to be efficiently used in biological studies. In this article, we propose a powerful framework to manage and analyse multi-omics heterogeneous data to carry out an integrative analysis. We have illustrated this using the mixOmics package for R software as it specifically addresses data integration issues. Our work also aims at applying the most recent functionalities of mixOmics to real datasets. Although multi-block integrative methodologies exist, we hope to encourage a more widespread use of such approaches in an operational framework by biologists. We have used natural populations of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana in this work, but the framework proposed is not limited to this plant and can be deployed whatever the organisms of interest and the biological question may be. Four omics datasets (phenomics, metabolomics, cell wall proteomics and transcriptomics) were collected, analysed and integrated to study the cell wall plasticity of plants exposed to sub-optimal temperature growth conditions. The methodologies presented here start from basic univariate statistics leading to multi-block integration analysis. We have also highlighted the fact that each method, either unsupervised or supervised, is associated with one biological issue. Using this powerful framework enabled us to arrive at novel conclusions on the biological system, which would not have been possible using standard statistical approaches.
39705170	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	NLSDeconv: an efficient cell-type deconvolution method for spatial transcriptomics data.	SUMMARY: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) allows gene expression profiling within intact tissue samples but lacks single-cell resolution. This necessitates computational deconvolution methods to estimate the contributions of distinct cell types. This article introduces NLSDeconv, a novel cell-type deconvolution method based on non-negative least squares, along with an accompanying Python package. Benchmarking against 18 existing deconvolution methods on various ST datasets demonstrates NLSDeconv's competitive statistical performance and superior computational efficiency. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: NLSDeconv is freely available at https://github.com/tinachentc/NLSDeconv as a Python package.
35501392	2022	Nature biotechnology	Spatially informed cell-type deconvolution for spatial transcriptomics.	Many spatially resolved transcriptomic technologies do not have single-cell resolution but measure the average gene expression for each spot from a mixture of cells of potentially heterogeneous cell types. Here, we introduce a deconvolution method, conditional autoregressive-based deconvolution (CARD), that combines cell-type-specific expression information from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with correlation in cell-type composition across tissue locations. Modeling spatial correlation allows us to borrow the cell-type composition information across locations, improving accuracy of deconvolution even with a mismatched scRNA-seq reference. CARD can also impute cell-type compositions and gene expression levels at unmeasured tissue locations to enable the construction of a refined spatial tissue map with a resolution arbitrarily higher than that measured in the original study and can perform deconvolution without an scRNA-seq reference. Applications to four datasets, including a pancreatic cancer dataset, identified multiple cell types and molecular markers with distinct spatial localization that define the progression, heterogeneity and compartmentalization of pancreatic cancer.
40839713	2025	PLoS computational biology	Improving cell-type composition inference in spatial transcriptomics with SpaDAMA.	Accurate determination of cell-type composition in disease-relevant tissues is essential for identifying potential disease targets and understanding tissue heterogeneity. Most current spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies lack single-cell resolution, which makes precise cell-type composition identification challenging. Several deconvolution methods have been developed to address this limitation by relying on single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from the same tissue as a reference to estimate the cell type composition in ST data spots. However, these methods often overlook the inherent differences between scRNA-seq and ST data. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a Domain-Adversarial Masked Autoencoder (SpaDAMA) method. SpaDAMA leverages Domain-Adversarial Learning (DAL) to facilitate effective knowledge transfer from the source domain (pseudo-ST data generated from scRNA-seq) to the target domain (real ST data). Through adversarial training, SpaDAMA harmonizes the distributions of both datasets and maps them onto a unified latent representation, thereby reducing discrepancies in data modalities. Furthermore, to strengthen the model's capability in extracting reliable features from real ST data, SpaDAMA employs masking strategies that effectively minimize noise and mitigate spatial artifacts. We validated SpaDAMA on 32 simulated datasets and 4 real-world datasets, demonstrating its superior performance in cell-type deconvolution and providing a promising tool for spatial transcriptomic analyses.
35758795	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	High-sensitivity pattern discovery in large, paired multiomic datasets.	MOTIVATION: Modern biological screens yield enormous numbers of measurements, and identifying and interpreting statistically significant associations among features are essential. In experiments featuring multiple high-dimensional datasets collected from the same set of samples, it is useful to identify groups of associated features between the datasets in a way that provides high statistical power and false discovery rate (FDR) control. RESULTS: Here, we present a novel hierarchical framework, HAllA (Hierarchical All-against-All association testing), for structured association discovery between paired high-dimensional datasets. HAllA efficiently integrates hierarchical hypothesis testing with FDR correction to reveal significant linear and non-linear block-wise relationships among continuous and/or categorical data. We optimized and evaluated HAllA using heterogeneous synthetic datasets of known association structure, where HAllA outperformed all-against-all and other block-testing approaches across a range of common similarity measures. We then applied HAllA to a series of real-world multiomics datasets, revealing new associations between gene expression and host immune activity, the microbiome and host transcriptome, metabolomic profiling and human health phenotypes. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: An open-source implementation of HAllA is freely available at http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/halla along with documentation, demo datasets and a user group. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
40598278	2025	Genome biology	Deciphering gene regulatory programs in mouse embryonic skin through single-cell multiomics analysis.	BACKGROUND: Cell type-specific transcriptional heterogeneity in embryonic mouse skin is well-documented, but few studies have investigated the regulatory mechanisms. Here, we present high-throughput single-cell chromatin accessibility and transcriptome sequencing (HT-scCAT-seq), a method that simultaneously profiles transcriptome and chromatin accessibility. We utilized HT-scCAT-seq to dissect the gene regulatory mechanism governing epidermal stratification, periderm terminal differentiation, and fibroblast specification. RESULTS: By linking chromatin accessibility to gene expression, we identify candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) and their target genes which are crucial for dermal and epidermal development. We describe cells with similar gene expression profiles that exhibit distinct chromatin accessibility statuses during periderm terminal differentiation. Finally, we characterize the underlying lineage-determining transcription factors and demonstrate that ALX4 and RUNX2 are candidate transcription factors regulators of the dermal papilla lineage development through in silico perturbation analysis and CUT&Tag experiment. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, HT-scCAT-seq represents a powerful tool for unraveling the spatiotemporal dynamics of gene regulation in single cells. Our results advance the understanding of embryonic skin development while providing a scalable framework for investigating regulatory mechanisms across diverse biological systems and disease contexts.
35027765	2022	Nature methods	Identifying temporal and spatial patterns of variation from multimodal data using MEFISTO.	Factor analysis is a widely used method for dimensionality reduction in genome biology, with applications from personalized health to single-cell biology. Existing factor analysis models assume independence of the observed samples, an assumption that fails in spatio-temporal profiling studies. Here we present MEFISTO, a flexible and versatile toolbox for modeling high-dimensional data when spatial or temporal dependencies between the samples are known. MEFISTO maintains the established benefits of factor analysis for multimodal data, but enables the performance of spatio-temporally informed dimensionality reduction, interpolation, and separation of smooth from non-smooth patterns of variation. Moreover, MEFISTO can integrate multiple related datasets by simultaneously identifying and aligning the underlying patterns of variation in a data-driven manner. To illustrate MEFISTO, we apply the model to different datasets with spatial or temporal resolution, including an evolutionary atlas of organ development, a longitudinal microbiome study, a single-cell multi-omics atlas of mouse gastrulation and spatially resolved transcriptomics.
39436034	2025	Nucleic acids research	Dog10K: an integrated Dog10K database summarizing canine multi-omics.	The diversity observed in canine breed phenotypes, together with their risk for heritabily disorders of relevance to dogs and humans, makes the species an ideal subject for studies aimed at understanding the genetic basis of complex traits and human biomedical models. Dog10K is an ongoing international collaboration that aims to uncover the genetic basis of phenotypic diversity, disease, behavior, and domestication history of dogs. To best present and make the extensive data accessible and user friendly, we have established the Dog10K (http://dog10k.kiz.ac.cn/) database, a comprehensive-omics resource summarizing multiple types of data. This database integrates single nucleotide variants (SNVs) from 1987 canine genomes, de-novo mutations (DNMs) from 43 dog breeds with >40x sequence, RNA-seq data of 105057 single nuclei from hippocampus, 74067 single cells from leukocytes and 30 blood samples from published canid studies. We provide clear visualization, statistics, browse, searching, and downloading functions for all data. We have integrated three analysis tools, Selscan, LiftOver and AgeConversion, to aid researchers in custom exploration of the comprehensive-omics data. The Dog10K database will serve as a foundational platform for analyzing, presenting and utilizing canine multi-omics data.
34374760	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	Cell fate conversion prediction by group sparse optimization method utilizing single-cell and bulk OMICs data.	Cell fate conversion by overexpressing defined factors is a powerful tool in regenerative medicine. However, identifying key factors for cell fate conversion requires laborious experimental efforts; thus, many of such conversions have not been achieved yet. Nevertheless, cell fate conversions found in many published studies were incomplete as the expression of important gene sets could not be manipulated thoroughly. Therefore, the identification of master transcription factors for complete and efficient conversion is crucial to render this technology more applicable clinically. In the past decade, systematic analyses on various single-cell and bulk OMICs data have uncovered numerous gene regulatory mechanisms, and made it possible to predict master gene regulators during cell fate conversion. By virtue of the sparse structure of master transcription factors and the group structure of their simultaneous regulatory effects on the cell fate conversion process, this study introduces a novel computational method predicting master transcription factors based on group sparse optimization technique integrating data from multi-OMICs levels, which can be applicable to both single-cell and bulk OMICs data with a high tolerance of data sparsity. When it is compared with current prediction methods by cross-referencing published and validated master transcription factors, it possesses superior performance. In short, this method facilitates fast identification of key regulators, give raise to the possibility of higher successful conversion rate and in the hope of reducing experimental cost.

Bin2cell reconstructs cells from the highest resolution data (2 mum bins) by leveraging morphology image segmentation and gene expression information. It is compatible with established Python single cell and spatial transcriptomics software, and operates efficiently in a matter of minutes without requiring a GPU. We demonstrate improvements in downstream analysis when using the reconstructed cells over default 8 mum bins on mouse brain and human colorectal cancer data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Bin2cell is available at https://github.com/Teichlab/bin2cell, along with documentation and usage examples, and can be installed from pip.

36545790	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	spaCI: deciphering spatial cellular communications through adaptive graph model.	Cell-cell communications are vital for biological signalling and play important roles in complex diseases. Recent advances in single-cell spatial transcriptomics (SCST) technologies allow examining the spatial cell communication landscapes and hold the promise for disentangling the complex ligand-receptor (L-R) interactions across cells. However, due to frequent dropout events and noisy signals in SCST data, it is challenging and lack of effective and tailored methods to accurately infer cellular communications. Herein, to decipher the cell-to-cell communications from SCST profiles, we propose a novel adaptive graph model with attention mechanisms named spaCI. spaCI incorporates both spatial locations and gene expression profiles of cells to identify the active L-R signalling axis across neighbouring cells. Through benchmarking with currently available methods, spaCI shows superior performance on both simulation data and real SCST datasets. Furthermore, spaCI is able to identify the upstream transcriptional factors mediating the active L-R interactions. For biological insights, we have applied spaCI to the seqFISH+ data of mouse cortex and the NanoString CosMx Spatial Molecular Imager (SMI) data of non-small cell lung cancer samples. spaCI reveals the hidden L-R interactions from the sparse seqFISH+ data, meanwhile identifies the inconspicuous L-R interactions including THBS1-ITGB1 between fibroblast and tumours in NanoString CosMx SMI data. spaCI further reveals that SMAD3 plays an important role in regulating the crosstalk between fibroblasts and tumours, which contributes to the prognosis of lung cancer patients. Collectively, spaCI addresses the challenges in interrogating SCST data for gaining insights into the underlying cellular communications, thus facilitates the discoveries of disease mechanisms, effective biomarkers and therapeutic targets.
35639508	2022	Nucleic acids research	EPIXplorer: A web server for prediction, analysis and visualization of enhancer-promoter interactions.	Long distance enhancers can physically interact with promoters to regulate gene expression through formation of enhancer-promoter (E-P) interactions. Identification of E-P interactions is also important for profound understanding of normal developmental and disease-associated risk variants. Although the state-of-art predictive computation methods facilitate the identification of E-P interactions to a certain extent, currently there is no efficient method that can meet various requirements of usage. Here we developed EPIXplorer, a user-friendly web server for efficient prediction, analysis and visualization of E-P interactions. EPIXplorer integrates 9 robust predictive algorithms, supports multiple types of 3D contact data and multi-omics data as input. The output from EPIXplorer is scored, fully annotated by regulatory elements and risk single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In addition, the Visualization and Downstream module provide further functional analysis, all the output files and high-quality images are available for download. Together, EPIXplorer provides a user-friendly interface to predict the E-P interactions in an acceptable time, as well as understand how the genome-wide association study (GWAS) variants influence disease pathology by altering DNA looping between enhancers and the target gene promoters. EPIXplorer is available at https://www.csuligroup.com/EPIXplorer.
34608315	2021	Nature methods	SEAM is a spatial single nuclear metabolomics method for dissecting tissue microenvironment.	Spatial metabolomics can reveal intercellular heterogeneity and tissue organization. Here we report on the spatial single nuclear metabolomics (SEAM) method, a flexible platform combining high-spatial-resolution imaging mass spectrometry and a set of computational algorithms that can display multiscale and multicolor tissue tomography together with identification and clustering of single nuclei by their in situ metabolic fingerprints. We first applied SEAM to a range of wild-type mouse tissues, then delineated a consistent pattern of metabolic zonation in mouse liver. We further studied the spatial metabolic profile in the human fibrotic liver. We discovered subpopulations of hepatocytes with special metabolic features associated with their proximity to the fibrotic niche, and validated this finding by spatial transcriptomics with Geo-seq. These demonstrations highlighted SEAM's ability to explore the spatial metabolic profile and tissue histology at the single-cell level, leading to a deeper understanding of tissue metabolic organization.
38468344	2024	Genome biology	Prediction of metabolites associated with somatic mutations in cancers by using genome-scale metabolic models and mutation data.	BACKGROUND: Oncometabolites, often generated as a result of a gene mutation, show pro-oncogenic function when abnormally accumulated in cancer cells. Identification of such mutation-associated metabolites will facilitate developing treatment strategies for cancers, but is challenging due to the large number of metabolites in a cell and the presence of multiple genes associated with cancer development. RESULTS: Here we report the development of a computational workflow that predicts metabolite-gene-pathway sets. Metabolite-gene-pathway sets present metabolites and metabolic pathways significantly associated with specific somatic mutations in cancers. The computational workflow uses both cancer patient-specific genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) and mutation data to generate metabolite-gene-pathway sets. A GEM is a computational model that predicts reaction fluxes at a genome scale and can be constructed in a cell-specific manner by using omics data. The computational workflow is first validated by comparing the resulting metabolite-gene pairs with multi-omics data (i.e., mutation data, RNA-seq data, and metabolome data) from acute myeloid leukemia and renal cell carcinoma samples collected in this study. The computational workflow is further validated by evaluating the metabolite-gene-pathway sets predicted for 18 cancer types, by using RNA-seq data publicly available, in comparison with the reported studies. Therapeutic potential of the resulting metabolite-gene-pathway sets is also discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Validation of the metabolite-gene-pathway set-predicting computational workflow indicates that a decent number of metabolites and metabolic pathways appear to be significantly associated with specific somatic mutations. The computational workflow and the resulting metabolite-gene-pathway sets will help identify novel oncometabolites and also suggest cancer treatment strategies.
41031875	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	SurvBoard: standardized benchmarking for multi-omics cancer survival models.	Multi-omics data, which include genomic, transcriptomic, epigenetic, and proteomic data, are gaining increasing importance for determining the clinical outcomes of cancer patients. Several recent studies have evaluated various multimodal integration strategies for cancer survival prediction, highlighting the need for standardizing model performance results. Addressing this issue, we introduce SurvBoard, a benchmark framework that standardizes key experimental design choices. SurvBoard enables comparisons between single-cancer and pan-cancer data models and assesses the benefits of using patient data with missing modalities. We also address common pitfalls in preprocessing and validating multi-omics cancer survival models. We apply SurvBoard to several exemplary use cases, further confirming that statistical models tend to outperform deep learning methods, especially for metrics measuring survival function calibration. Moreover, most models exhibit better performance when trained in a pan-cancer context and can benefit from leveraging samples for which data of some omics modalities are missing. We provide a web service for model evaluation and to make our benchmark results easily accessible and viewable: https://www.survboard.science/. All code is available on GitHub: https://github.com/BoevaLab/survboard/. All benchmark outputs are available on Zenodo: 10.5281/zenodo.11066226. A video tutorial on how to use the Survboard leaderboard is available on YouTube at https://youtu.be/HJrdpJP8Vvk.

38483255	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Deep learning in spatially resolved transcriptfomics: a comprehensive technical view.	Spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) is a pioneering method for simultaneously studying morphological contexts and gene expression at single-cell precision. Data emerging from SRT are multifaceted, presenting researchers with intricate gene expression matrices, precise spatial details and comprehensive histology visuals. Such rich and intricate datasets, unfortunately, render many conventional methods like traditional machine learning and statistical models ineffective. The unique challenges posed by the specialized nature of SRT data have led the scientific community to explore more sophisticated analytical avenues. Recent trends indicate an increasing reliance on deep learning algorithms, especially in areas such as spatial clustering, identification of spatially variable genes and data alignment tasks. In this manuscript, we provide a rigorous critique of these advanced deep learning methodologies, probing into their merits, limitations and avenues for further refinement. Our in-depth analysis underscores that while the recent innovations in deep learning tailored for SRT have been promising, there remains a substantial potential for enhancement. A crucial area that demands attention is the development of models that can incorporate intricate biological nuances, such as phylogeny-aware processing or in-depth analysis of minuscule histology image segments. Furthermore, addressing challenges like the elimination of batch effects, perfecting data normalization techniques and countering the overdispersion and zero inflation patterns seen in gene expression is pivotal. To support the broader scientific community in their SRT endeavors, we have meticulously assembled a comprehensive directory of readily accessible SRT databases, hoping to serve as a foundation for future research initiatives.
40098013	2025	Genome biology	Systematic interrogation of functional genes underlying cholesterol and lipid homeostasis.	BACKGROUND: Dyslipidemia or hypercholesterolemia are among the main risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Unraveling the molecular basis of lipid or cholesterol homeostasis would help to identify novel drug targets and develop effective therapeutics. RESULTS: Here, we adopt a systematic approach to catalog the genes underlying lipid and cholesterol homeostasis by combinatorial use of high-throughput CRISPR screening, RNA sequencing, human genetic variant association analysis, and proteomic and metabolomic profiling. Such integrative multi-omics efforts identify gamma-glutamyltransferase GGT7 as an intriguing potential cholesterol and lipid regulator. As a SREBP2-dependent target, GGT7 positively regulates cellular cholesterol levels and affects the expression of several cholesterol metabolism genes. Furthermore, GGT7 interacts with actin-dependent motor protein MYH10 to control low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) uptake into the cells.

CONCLUSIONS: Our study not only provides a repertoire of lipid or cholesterol regulatory genes from multiple angles but also reveals a causal link between a gamma-glutamyltransferase and cholesterol metabolism.
36318263	2023	Nucleic acids research	EDomics: a comprehensive and comparative multi-omics database for animal evo-devo.	Evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo) has been among the most fascinating interdisciplinary fields for decades, which aims to elucidate the origin and evolution of diverse developmental processes. The rapid accumulation of omics data provides unprecedented opportunities to answer many interesting but unresolved evo-devo questions. However, the access and utilization of these resources are hindered by challenges particularly in non-model animals. Here, we establish a comparative multi-omics database for animal evo-devo (EDomics, http://edomics.qnlm.ac) containing comprehensive genomes, bulk transcriptomes, and single-cell data across 40 representative species, many of which are generally used as model organisms for animal evo-devo study. EDomics provides a systematic view of genomic/transcriptomic information from various aspects, including genome assembly statistics, gene features and families, transcription factors, transposable elements, and gene expressional profiles/networks. It also exhibits spatiotemporal gene expression profiles at a single-cell level, such as cell atlas, cell markers, and spatial-map information. Moreover, EDomics provides highly valuable, customized datasets/resources for evo-devo research, including gene family expansion/contraction, inferred core gene repertoires, macrosynteny analysis for karyotype evolution, and cell type evolution analysis. EDomics presents a comprehensive and comparative multi-omics platform for animal evo-devo community to decipher the whole history of developmental evolution across the tree of life.
40662813	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Spatial transcriptomics deconvolution methods generalize well to spatial chromatin accessibility data.	MOTIVATION: Spatially resolved chromatin accessibility profiling offers the potential to investigate gene regulatory processes within the spatial context of tissues. However, current methods typically work at spot resolution, aggregating measurements from multiple cells, thereby obscuring cell-type-specific spatial patterns of accessibility. Spot deconvolution methods have been developed and extensively benchmarked for spatial transcriptomics, yet no dedicated methods exist for spatial chromatin accessibility, and it is unclear if RNA-based approaches are applicable to that modality. RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate that these RNA-based approaches can be applied to spot-based chromatin accessibility data by a systematic evaluation of five top-performing spatial transcriptomics deconvolution methods. To assess performance, we developed a simulation framework that generates both transcriptomic and accessibility spot data from dissociated single-cell and targeted multiomic datasets, enabling direct comparisons across both data modalities. Our results show that Cell2location and RCTD, in contrast to other methods, exhibit robust performance on spatial chromatin accessibility data, achieving accuracy comparable to RNA-based deconvolution. Generally, we observed that RNA-based deconvolution exhibited slightly better performance compared to chromatin accessibility-based deconvolution, especially for resolving rare cell types, indicating room for future development of specialized methods. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that existing deconvolution methods can be readily applied to chromatin accessibility-based spatial data. Our work provides a simulation framework and establishes a performance baseline to guide the development and evaluation of methods optimized for spatial epigenomics. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: All methods, simulation frameworks, peak selection strategies, analysis notebooks and scripts are available at https://github.com/theislab/deconvATAC.
41251144	2025	Nucleic acids research	ChromPolymerDB: a high-resolution database of single-cell 3D chromatin structures for functional genomics.	The three-dimensional (3D) organization of chromatin plays a critical role in regulating gene expression and genomic processes like DNA replication, repair, and genome stability. Although these processes occur at the individual-cell level, most chromatin structure data are derived from population-averaged assays, such as Hi-C, obscuring the heterogeneity of single-cell conformations. To address this limitation, we developed a polymer physics-based modeling framework, the sequential Bayesian inference framework (sBIF), that deconvolutes bulk Hi-C data to reconstruct single-cell 3D chromatin conformations. To support a broader use of sBIF, we created ChromPolymerDB, a publicly accessible, high-resolution database of single-cell chromatin structures inferred by sBIF. The database contains  approximately 108 reconstructed 5 kb-resolution single cell structures, spanning over 60,000 genomic loci across 50 human cell types and experimental conditions. ChromPolymerDB features an interactive web interface with tools for 3D structural analysis and multi-omics integration. Users can explore associations between chromatin conformation and gene expression, epigenetic modifications, and regulatory elements. The platform also supports comparative analyses to identify structural changes across cell types, developmental stages, or disease contexts. ChromPolymerDB offers a unique resource for researchers studying the relationship between genome architecture and gene regulation, and for advancing comparative 3D genomics. ChromPolymerDB is available online at https://chrompolymerdb.bme.uic.edu/.
38844627	2024	Nature methods	Accurate and efficient integrative reference-informed spatial domain detection for spatial transcriptomics.	Spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) studies are becoming increasingly common and large, offering unprecedented opportunities in mapping complex tissue structures and functions. Here we present integrative and reference-informed tissue segmentation (IRIS), a computational method designed to characterize tissue spatial organization in SRT studies through accurately and efficiently detecting spatial domains. IRIS uniquely leverages single-cell RNA sequencing data for reference-informed detection of biologically interpretable spatial domains, integrating multiple SRT slices while explicitly considering correlations both within and across slices. We demonstrate the advantages of IRIS through in-depth analysis of six SRT datasets encompassing diverse technologies, tissues, species and resolutions. In these applications, IRIS achieves substantial accuracy gains (39-1,083%) and speed improvements (4.6-666.0) in moderate-sized datasets, while representing the only method applicable for large datasets including Stereo-seq and 10x Xenium. As a result, IRIS reveals intricate brain structures, uncovers tumor microenvironment heterogeneity and detects structural changes in diabetes-affected testis, all with exceptional speed and accuracy.
36975610	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Con-AAE: contrastive cycle adversarial autoencoders for single-cell multi-omics alignment and integration.	MOTIVATION: We have entered the multi-omics era and can measure cells from different aspects. Hence, we can get a more comprehensive view by integrating or matching data from different spaces corresponding to the same object. However, it is particularly challenging in the single-cell multi-omics scenario because such data are very sparse with extremely high dimensions. Though some techniques can be used to measure scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq simultaneously, the data are usually highly noisy due to the limitations of the experimental environment. RESULTS: To promote single-cell multi-omics research, we overcome the above challenges, proposing a novel framework, contrastive cycle adversarial autoencoders, which can align and integrate single-cell RNA-seq data and single-cell ATAC-seq data. Con-AAE can efficiently map the above data with high sparsity and noise from different spaces to a coordinated subspace, where alignment and integration tasks can be easier. We demonstrate its advantages on several datasets. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Zenodo link: https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/368779433. github: https://github.com/kakarotcq/Con-AAE.
36692138	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	NetProphet 3: a machine learning framework for transcription factor network mapping and multi-omics integration.	MOTIVATION: Many methods have been proposed for mapping the targets of transcription factors (TFs) from gene expression data. It is known that combining outputs from multiple methods can improve performance. To date, outputs have been combined by using either simplistic formulae, such as geometric mean, or carefully hand-tuned formulae that may not generalize well to new inputs. Finally, the evaluation of accuracy has been challenging due to the lack of genome-scale, ground-truth networks. RESULTS: We developed NetProphet3, which combines scores from multiple analyses automatically, using a tree boosting algorithm trained on TF binding location data. We also developed three independent, genome-scale evaluation metrics. By these metrics, NetProphet3 is more accurate than other commonly used packages, including NetProphet 2.0, when gene expression data from direct TF perturbations are available. Furthermore, its integration mode can forge a consensus network from gene expression data and TF binding location data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: All data and code are available at https://zenodo.org/record/7504131#.Y7Wu3i-B2x8. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
39436044	2025	Nucleic acids research	PneumoBrowse 2: an integrated visual platform for curated genome annotation and multiomics data analysis of Streptococcus pneumoniae.	Streptococcus pneumoniae is an opportunistic human pathogen responsible for high morbidity and mortality rates. Extensive genome sequencing revealed its large pangenome, serotype diversity, and provided insight into genome dynamics. However, functional genome analysis has lagged behind, as that requires detailed and time-consuming manual curation of genome annotations and integration of genomic and phenotypic data. To remedy this, PneumoBrowse was presented in 2018, a user-friendly interactive online platform, which provided the detailed annotation of the S. pneumoniae D39V genome, alongside transcriptomic data. Since 2018, many new studies on S. pneumoniae genome biology and protein functioning have been performed. Here, we present PneumoBrowse 2 (https://veeninglab.com/pneumobrowse), fully rebuilt in JBrowse 2. We updated annotations for transcribed and transcriptional regulatory features in the D39V genome. We added genome-wide data tracks for high-resolution chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) data, chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq), ribosome profiling, CRISPRi-seq gene essentiality data and more. Additionally, we included 18 phylogenetically diverse S. pneumoniae genomes and their annotations. By providing easy access to diverse high-quality genome annotations and links to other databases (including UniProt and AlphaFold), PneumoBrowse 2 will further accelerate research and development into preventive and treatment strategies, through increased understanding of the pneumococcal genome.
32402082	2020	Nucleic acids research	PaccMann: a web service for interpretable anticancer compound sensitivity prediction.	The identification of new targeted and personalized therapies for cancer requires the fast and accurate assessment of the drug efficacy of potential compounds against a particular biomolecular sample. It has been suggested that the integration of complementary sources of information might strengthen the accuracy of a drug efficacy prediction model. Here, we present a web-based platform for the Prediction of AntiCancer Compound sensitivity with Multimodal Attention-based Neural Networks (PaccMann). PaccMann is trained on public transcriptomic cell line profiles, compound structure information and drug sensitivity screenings, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on anticancer drug sensitivity prediction. On the open-access web service (https://ibm.biz/paccmann-aas), users can select a known drug compound or design their own compound structure in an interactive editor, perform in-silico drug testing and investigate compound efficacy on publicly available or user-provided transcriptomic profiles. PaccMann leverages methods for model interpretability and outputs confidence scores as well as attention heatmaps that highlight the genes and chemical sub-structures that were more important to make a prediction, hence facilitating the understanding of the model's decision making and the involved biochemical processes. We hope to serve the community with a toolbox for fast and efficient validation in drug repositioning or lead compound identification regimes.
41182757	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	SLGCA: spatial cross-level graph contrastive autoencoder for multislice spatial domain identification and microenvironment exploration.	The development of spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies has enabled researchers to better understand cells' spatial organization and functional heterogeneity within their native tissue context. Spatial domain identification plays a crucial role in ST data analysis. However, most existing spatial domain identification methods do not fully exploit spatial information, and often fail to adequately integrate both local and global features, resulting in suboptimal spatial domain identification. We propose SLGCA, a novel method based on cross-level graph contrastive learning to address these challenges. SLGCA adopts a dual-channel learning mechanism, combining local-level contrastive learning based on spatial neighborhood information and global information contrastive learning across views, thereby significantly enhancing the accuracy of spatial domain identification. SLGCA can integrate multiple tissue sections without needing pre-alignment or external tools, eliminating batch effects and accurately identifying spatial domains across multiple slices. Experimental results show that SLGCA significantly outperforms the benchmark methods in spatial domain identification accuracy on ST data generated by multiple techniques. Moreover, SLGCA enables accurate dissection of tumor heterogeneity in human breast cancer datasets and effectively uncovers the heterogeneous tumor microenvironment in liver cancer, revealing two distinct fibroblast subtypes.
40240000	2025	Nucleic acids research	Benchmarking computational methods for detecting spatial domains and domain-specific spatially variable genes from spatial transcriptomics data.	Advances in spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) have led to the emergence of numerous computational methods for identifying spatial domains and spatially variable genes (SVGs); however, a comprehensive assessment of existing methods is lacking. We comprehensively benchmarked 19 methods for detecting spatial domains and domain-specific SVGs from SRT data, using 30 real-world datasets covering six SRT technologies and 27 synthetic datasets. We first evaluated the performance of these methods on spatial domain identification in terms of accuracy, stability, generalizability, and scalability. Results reveal that there is no single method that works best for all datasets, and the optimal method depends on the data, especially the SRT platform. Further, we proposed a quantitative strategy to evaluate domain-specific SVG recognition results and assessed the impact of spatial domains on SVG detection. We found that SVG detection based on spatial domains identified by different GNN methods have high accuracy but low concordance. Generally, the more accurate the recognized spatial domains, the higher the number and accuracy of domain-specific SVGs detected. Moreover, integrating spatial clustering results from different methods can lead to more robust and better clustering and SVG results. Practical guidelines were provided for choosing appropriate methods for spatial domain and domain-specific SVG identification.
31774481	2020	Briefings in bioinformatics	A comparative study of multi-omics integration tools for cancer driver gene identification and tumour subtyping.	Oncogenesis and cancer can arise as a consequence of a wide range of genomic aberrations including mutations, copy number alterations, expression changes and epigenetic modifications encompassing multiple omics layers. Integrating genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and epigenomic datasets via multi-omics analysis provides the opportunity to derive a deeper and holistic understanding of the development and progression of cancer. There are two primary approaches to integrating multi-omics data: multi-staged (focused on identifying genes driving cancer) and meta-dimensional (focused on establishing clinically relevant tumour or sample classifications). A number of ready-to-use bioinformatics tools are available to perform both multi-staged and meta-dimensional integration of multi-omics data. In this study, we compared nine different integration tools using real and simulated cancer datasets. The performance of the multi-staged integration tools were assessed at the gene, function and pathway levels, while meta-dimensional integration tools were assessed based on the sample classification performance. Additionally, we discuss the influence of factors such as data representation, sample size, signal and noise on multi-omics data integration. Our results provide current and much needed guidance regarding selection and use of the most appropriate and best performing multi-omics integration tools.

40091193	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Graph neural networks for single-cell omics data: a review of approaches and applications.	Rapid advancement of sequencing technologies now allows for the utilization of precise signals at single-cell resolution in various omics studies. However, the massive volume, ultra-high dimensionality, and high sparsity nature of single-cell data have introduced substantial difficulties to traditional computational methods. The intricate non-Euclidean networks of intracellular and intercellular signaling molecules within single-cell datasets, coupled with the complex, multimodal structures arising from multi-omics joint analysis, pose significant challenges to conventional deep learning operations reliant on Euclidean geometries. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have extended deep learning to non-Euclidean data, allowing cells and their features in single-cell datasets to be modeled as nodes within a graph structure. GNNs have been successfully applied across a broad range of tasks in single-cell data analysis. In this survey, we systematically review 107 successful applications of GNNs and their six variants in various single-cell omics tasks. We begin by outlining the fundamental principles of GNNs and their six variants, followed by a systematic review of GNN-based models applied in single-cell epigenomics, transcriptomics, spatial transcriptomics, proteomics, and multi-omics. In each section dedicated to a specific omics type, we have summarized the publicly available single-cell datasets commonly utilized in the articles reviewed in that section, totaling 77 datasets. Finally, we summarize the potential shortcomings of current research and explore directions for future studies. We anticipate that this review will serve as a guiding resource for researchers to deepen the application of GNNs in single-cell omics.
34864875	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	Multiomics integration-based molecular characterizations of COVID-19.	The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), rapidly became a global health challenge, leading to unprecedented social and economic consequences. The mechanisms behind the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 are both unique and complex. Omics-scale studies are emerging rapidly and offer a tremendous potential to unravel the puzzle of SARS-CoV-2 pathobiology, as well as moving forward with diagnostics, potential drug targets, risk stratification, therapeutic responses, vaccine development and therapeutic innovation. This review summarizes various aspects of understanding multiomics integration-based molecular characterizations of COVID-19, which to date include the integration of transcriptomics, proteomics, genomics, lipidomics, immunomics and metabolomics to explore virus targets and developing suitable therapeutic solutions through systems biology tools. Furthermore, this review also covers an abridgment of omics investigations related to disease pathogenesis and virulence, the role of host genetic variation and a broad array of immune and inflammatory phenotypes contributing to understanding COVID-19 traits. Insights into this review, which combines existing strategies and multiomics integration profiling, may help further advance our knowledge of COVID-19.
33997893	2021	Nucleic acids research	SynLeGG: analysis and visualization of multiomics data for discovery of cancer 'Achilles Heels' and gene function relationships.	Achilles' heel relationships arise when the status of one gene exposes a cell's vulnerability to perturbation of a second gene, such as chemical inhibition, providing therapeutic opportunities for precision oncology. SynLeGG (www.overton-lab.uk/synlegg) identifies and visualizes mutually exclusive loss signatures in 'omics data to enable discovery of genetic dependency relationships (GDRs) across 783 cancer cell lines and 30 tissues. While there is significant focus on genetic approaches, transcriptome data has advantages for investigation of GDRs and remains relatively underexplored. SynLeGG depends upon the MultiSEp algorithm for unsupervised assignment of cell lines into gene expression clusters, which provide the basis for analysis of CRISPR scores and mutational status in order to propose candidate GDRs. Benchmarking against SynLethDB demonstrates favourable performance for MultiSEp against competing approaches, finding significantly higher area under the Receiver Operator Characteristic curve and between 2.8-fold to 8.5-fold greater coverage. In addition to pan-cancer analysis, SynLeGG offers investigation of tissue-specific GDRs and recovers established relationships, including synthetic lethality for SMARCA2 with SMARCA4. Proteomics, Gene Ontology, protein-protein interactions and paralogue information are provided to assist interpretation and candidate drug target prioritization. SynLeGG predictions are significantly enriched in dependencies validated by a recently published CRISPR screen.
30184043	2019	Briefings in bioinformatics	Breast cancer prognosis signature: linking risk stratification to disease subtypes.	Breast cancer is a very complex and heterogeneous disease with variable molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis and clinical behaviors. The identification of prognostic risk factors may enable effective diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. In particular, numerous gene-expression-based prognostic signatures were developed and some of them have already been applied into clinical trials and practice. In this study, we summarized several representative gene-expression-based signatures with significant prognostic value and separately assessed their ability of prognosis prediction in their originally targeted populations of breast cancer. Notably, many of the collected signatures were originally designed to predict the outcomes of estrogen receptor positive (ER+) patients or the whole breast cancer cohort; there are no typical signatures used for the prognostic prediction in a specific population of patients with the intrinsic subtype. We thus attempted to identify subtype-specific prognostic signatures via a computational framework for analyzing multi-omics profiles and patient survival. For both the discovery and an independent data set, we confirmed that subtype-specific signature is a strong and significant independent prognostic factor in the corresponding cohort. These results indicate that the subtype-specific prognostic signature has a much higher resolution in the risk stratification, which may lead to improved therapies and precision medicine for patients with breast cancer.
40505018	2025	PLoS computational biology	Sparse deconvolution of cell type medleys in spatial transcriptomics.	Mapping cell distributions across spatial locations with whole-genome coverage is essential for understanding cellular responses and signaling However, current deconvolution models aim to estimate the proportions of distinct cell types in each spatial transcriptomics spot by integrating reference single-cell data. These models often assume strong overlap between the reference and spatial datasets, neglecting biology-grounded constraints such as sparsity and cell-type variations, as well as technical sparsity. As a result, these methods rely on over-permissive algorithms that ignore given constraints leading to inaccurate predictions, particularly in heterogeneous or unmatched datasets. We introduce Weight-Induced Sparse Regression (WISpR), a machine learning algorithm that integrates spot-specific hyperparameters and sparsity-driven modeling. Unlike conventional approaches that neglect biology-grounded constraints, WISpR accurately predicts cell-type distributions while preserving biological coherence, i.e., spatially and functionally consistent cell-type localization, even in unmatched datasets. Benchmarking against five alternative methods across ten datasets, WISpR consistently outperformed competitors and predicted cellular landscapes in both normal and cancerous tissues. By leveraging sparse cell-type arrangements, WISpR provides biologically informed, high-resolution cellular maps. Its ability to decode tissue organization in both healthy and diseased states highlights WISpR's practical utility for spatial transcriptomics, particularly in challenging settings involving noise, sparsity, or reference mismatches.
35043143	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	Network-based integrative analysis of single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic data for cell types.	Advances in single-cell biotechnologies simultaneously generate the transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles at cell levels, providing an opportunity for investigating cell fates. Although great efforts have been devoted to either of them, the integrative analysis of single-cell multi-omics data is really limited because of the heterogeneity, noises and sparsity of single-cell profiles. In this study, a network-based integrative clustering algorithm (aka NIC) is present for the identification of cell types by fusing the parallel single-cell transcriptomic (scRNA-seq) and epigenomic profiles (scATAC-seq or DNA methylation). To avoid heterogeneity of multi-omics data, NIC automatically learns the cell-cell similarity graphs, which transforms the fusion of multi-omics data into the analysis of multiple networks. Then, NIC employs joint non-negative matrix factorization to learn the shared features of cells by exploiting the structure of learned cell-cell similarity networks, providing a better way to characterize the features of cells. The graph learning and integrative analysis procedures are jointly formulated as an optimization problem, and then the update rules are derived. Thirteen single-cell multi-omics datasets from various tissues and organisms are adopted to validate the performance of NIC, and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of various measurements. The proposed algorithm provides an effective strategy for the integrative analysis of single-cell multi-omics data (The software is coded using Matlab, and is freely available for academic https://github.com/xkmaxidian/NIC ).
39356327	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Recover then aggregate: unified cross-modal deep clustering with global structural information for single-cell data.	Single-cell cross-modal joint clustering has been extensively utilized to investigate the tumor microenvironment. Although numerous approaches have been suggested, accurate clustering remains the main challenge. First, the gene expression matrix frequently contains numerous missing values due to measurement limitations. The majority of existing clustering methods treat it as a typical multi-modal dataset without further processing. Few methods conduct recovery before clustering and do not sufficiently engage with the underlying research, leading to suboptimal outcomes. Additionally, the existing cross-modal information fusion strategy does not ensure consistency of representations across different modes, potentially leading to the integration of conflicting information, which could degrade performance. To address these challenges, we propose the 'Recover then Aggregate' strategy and introduce the Unified Cross-Modal Deep Clustering model. Specifically, we have developed a data augmentation technique based on neighborhood similarity, iteratively imposing rank constraints on the Laplacian matrix, thus updating the similarity matrix and recovering dropout events. Concurrently, we integrate cross-modal features and employ contrastive learning to align modality-specific representations with consistent ones, enhancing the effective integration of diverse modal information. Comprehensive experiments on five real-world multi-modal datasets have demonstrated this method's superior effectiveness in single-cell clustering tasks.
38580401	2024	Genome research	Systematic mapping of TF-mediated cell fate changes by a pooled induction coupled with scRNA-seq and multi-omics approaches.	Transcriptional regulation controls cellular functions through interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and their chromosomal targets. However, understanding the fate conversion potential of multiple TFs in an inducible manner remains limited. Here, we introduce iTF-seq as a method for identifying individual TFs that can alter cell fate toward specific lineages at a single-cell level. iTF-seq enables time course monitoring of transcriptome changes, and with biotinylated individual TFs, it provides a multi-omics approach to understanding the mechanisms behind TF-mediated cell fate changes. Our iTF-seq study in mouse embryonic stem cells identified multiple TFs that trigger rapid transcriptome changes indicative of differentiation within a day of induction. Moreover, cells expressing these potent TFs often show a slower cell cycle and increased cell death. Further analysis using bioChIP-seq revealed that GCM1 and OTX2 act as pioneer factors and activators by increasing gene accessibility and activating the expression of lineage specification genes during cell fate conversion. iTF-seq has utility in both mapping cell fate conversion and understanding cell fate conversion mechanisms.

36243959	2023	Nucleic acids research	TWAS Atlas: a curated knowledgebase of transcriptome-wide association studies.	Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWASs), as a practical and prevalent approach for detecting the associations between genetically regulated genes and traits, are now leading to a better understanding of the complex mechanisms of genetic variants in regulating various diseases and traits. Despite the ever-increasing TWAS outputs, there is still a lack of databases curating massive public TWAS information and knowledge. To fill this gap, here we present TWAS Atlas (https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/twas/), an integrated knowledgebase of TWAS findings manually curated from extensive literature. In the current implementation, TWAS Atlas collects 401,266 high-quality human gene-trait associations from 200 publications, covering 22,247 genes and 257 traits across 135 tissue types. In particular, an interactive knowledge graph of the collected gene-trait associations is constructed together with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-gene associations to build up comprehensive regulatory networks at multi-omics levels. In addition, TWAS Atlas, as a user-friendly web interface, efficiently enables users to browse, search and download all association information, relevant research metadata and annotation information of interest. Taken together, TWAS Atlas is of great value for promoting the utility and availability of TWAS results in explaining the complex genetic basis as well as providing new insights for human health and disease research.
35854350	2022	Genome biology	Integration of single-cell multi-omics data by regression analysis on unpaired observations.	Despite recent developments, it is hard to profile all multi-omics single-cell data modalities on the same cell. Thus, huge amounts of single-cell genomics data of unpaired observations on different cells are generated. We propose a method named UnpairReg for the regression analysis on unpaired observations to integrate single-cell multi-omics data. On real and simulated data, UnpairReg provides an accurate estimation of cell gene expression where only chromatin accessibility data is available. The cis-regulatory network inferred from UnpairReg is highly consistent with eQTL mapping. UnpairReg improves cell type identification accuracy by joint analysis of single-cell gene expression and chromatin accessibility data.
39187683	2024	Nature methods	Inferring pattern-driving intercellular flows from single-cell and spatial transcriptomics.	From single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics (ST), one can extract high-dimensional gene expression patterns that can be described by intercellular communication networks or decoupled gene modules. These two descriptions of information flow are often assumed to occur independently. However, intercellular communication drives directed flows of information that are mediated by intracellular gene modules, in turn triggering outflows of other signals. Methodologies to describe such intercellular flows are lacking. We present FlowSig, a method that infers communication-driven intercellular flows from scRNA-seq or ST data using graphical causal modeling and conditional independence. We benchmark FlowSig using newly generated experimental cortical organoid data and synthetic data generated from mathematical modeling. We demonstrate FlowSig's utility by applying it to various studies, showing that FlowSig can capture stimulation-induced changes to paracrine signaling in pancreatic islets, demonstrate shifts in intercellular flows due to increasing COVID-19 severity and reconstruct morphogen-driven activator-inhibitor patterns in mouse embryogenesis.
39508444	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	SpaDiT: diffusion transformer for spatial gene expression prediction using scRNA-seq.	The rapid development of spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) technologies has provided unprecedented opportunities for exploring the structure of specific organs or tissues. However, these techniques (such as image-based SRT) can achieve single-cell resolution, but can only capture the expression levels of tens to hundreds of genes. Such spatial transcriptomics (ST) data, carrying a large number of undetected genes, have limited its application value. To address the challenge, we develop SpaDiT, a deep learning framework for spatial reconstruction and gene expression prediction using scRNA-seq data. SpaDiT employs scRNA-seq data as an a priori condition and utilizes shared genes between ST and scRNA-seq data as latent representations to construct inputs, thereby facilitating the accurate prediction of gene expression in ST data. SpaDiT enhances the accuracy of spatial gene expression predictions over a variety of spatial transcriptomics datasets. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of SpaDiT by conducting extensive experiments on both seq-based and image-based ST data. We compared SpaDiT with eight highly effective baseline methods and found that our proposed method achieved an 8%-12% improvement in performance across multiple metrics. Source code and all datasets used in this paper are available at https://github.com/wenwenmin/SpaDiT and https://zenodo.org/records/12792074.
28837001	2017	Genome biology	New skin for the old RNA-Seq ceremony: the age of single-cell multi-omics.	New methods for simultaneously quantifying protein and gene expression at the single-cell level have the power to identify cell types and to classify cell populations.
41091734	2025	PLoS computational biology	CASynergy: A causal attention model for interpretable prediction of cancer drug synergy.	Cancer drug combination therapies offer a promising strategy to overcome resistance and improve treatment efficacy, but identifying synergistic drug pairs is challenging due to complex biological interactions and tumor heterogeneity. Current machine learning algorithms for drug synergy prediction primarily rely on large-scale, multimodal datasets, yet suffer from critical limitations including poor interpretability, difficulty distinguishing causative biological relationships from correlations, and inadequate modeling of cancer-specific molecular interactions. To address these challenges, we propose CASynergy (Causal Attention and Cross-attention Synergy), a novel deep learning model for predicting cancer drug synergy that addresses limitations of prior approaches in accuracy and interpretability. CASynergy introduces a causal attention mechanism to distinguish true causal genomic features from spurious correlations, cell line-specific gene network construction to capture the unique molecular context of each cancer cell line, and a cross-attention module to integrate drug molecular features with cell line gene expression profiles. These improvements allow CASynergy to clearly identify significant drug-gene interactions and provides interpretable insights into why a combination is predicted to be synergistic. Experiments on two benchmark datasets (DrugCombDB and Oncology-Screen) suggests that CASynergy outperformed five state-of-the-art models. CASynergy offers a better and more reliable way to predict effective drug combinations. It works well across different cancer types and is easier to understand, which is important for personalized cancer treatment and finding new drugs.
38706319	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Revealing cell-cell communication pathways with their spatially coupled gene programs.	Inference of cell-cell communication (CCC) provides valuable information in understanding the mechanisms of many important life processes. With the rise of spatial transcriptomics in recent years, many methods have emerged to predict CCCs using spatial information of cells. However, most existing methods only describe CCCs based on ligand-receptor interactions, but lack the exploration of their upstream/downstream pathways. In this paper, we proposed a new method to infer CCCs, called Intercellular Gene Association Network (IGAN). Specifically, it is for the first time that we can estimate the gene associations/network between two specific single spatially adjacent cells. By using the IGAN method, we can not only infer CCCs in an accurate manner, but also explore the upstream/downstream pathways of ligands/receptors from the network perspective, which are actually exhibited as a new panoramic cell-interaction-pathway graph, and thus provide extensive information for the regulatory mechanisms behind CCCs. In addition, IGAN can measure the CCC activity at single cell/spot resolution, and help to discover the CCC spatial heterogeneity. Interestingly, we found that CCC patterns from IGAN are highly consistent with the spatial microenvironment patterns for each cell type, which further indicated the accuracy of our method. Analyses on several public datasets validated the advantages of IGAN.
38493339	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	scMLC: an accurate and robust multiplex community detection method for single-cell multi-omics data.	Clustering cells based on single-cell multi-modal sequencing technologies provides an unprecedented opportunity to create high-resolution cell atlas, reveal cellular critical states and study health and diseases. However, effectively integrating different sequencing data for cell clustering remains a challenging task. Motivated by the successful application of Louvain in scRNA-seq data, we propose a single-cell multi-modal Louvain clustering framework, called scMLC, to tackle this problem. scMLC builds multiplex single- and cross-modal cell-to-cell networks to capture modal-specific and consistent information between modalities and then adopts a robust multiplex community detection method to obtain the reliable cell clusters. In comparison with 15 state-of-the-art clustering methods on seven real datasets simultaneously measuring gene expression and chromatin accessibility, scMLC achieves better accuracy and stability in most datasets. Synthetic results also indicate that the cell-network-based integration strategy of multi-omics data is superior to other strategies in terms of generalization. Moreover, scMLC is flexible and can be extended to single-cell sequencing data with more than two modalities.
37669132	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Multimodal learning of noncoding variant effects using genome sequence and chromatin structure.	"MOTIVATION: A growing amount of noncoding genetic variants, including single-nucleotide polymorphisms, are found to be associated with complex human traits and diseases. Their mechanistic interpretation is relatively limited and can use the help from computational prediction of their effects on epigenetic profiles. However, current models often focus on local, 1D genome sequence determinants and disregard global, 3D chromatin structure that critically affects epigenetic events. RESULTS: We find that noncoding variants of unexpected high similarity in epigenetic profiles, with regards to their relatively low similarity in local sequences, can be largely attributed to their proximity in chromatin structure. Accordingly, we have developed a multimodal deep learning scheme that incorporates both data of 1D genome sequence and 3D chromatin structure for predicting noncoding variant effects. Specifically, we have integrated convolutional and recurrent neural networks for sequence embedding and graph neural networks for structure embedding despite the resolution gap between the two types of data, while utilizing recent DNA language models. Numerical results show that our models outperform competing sequence-only models in predicting epigenetic profiles and their use of long-range interactions complement sequence-only models in extracting regulatory motifs. They prove to be excellent predictors for noncoding variant effects in gene expression and pathogenicity, whether in unsupervised ""zero-shot"" learning or supervised ""few-shot"" learning. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Codes and data can be accessed at https://github.com/Shen-Lab/ncVarPred-1D3D and https://zenodo.org/record/7975777."
35753702	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	A comprehensive comparison on cell-type composition inference for spatial transcriptomics data.	Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies allow researchers to examine transcriptional profiles along with maintained positional information. Such spatially resolved transcriptional characterization of intact tissue samples provides an integrated view of gene expression in its natural spatial and functional context. However, high-throughput sequencing-based ST technologies cannot yet reach single cell resolution. Thus, similar to bulk RNA-seq data, gene expression data at ST spot-level reflect transcriptional profiles of multiple cells and entail the inference of cell-type composition within each ST spot for valid and powerful subsequent analyses. Realizing the critical importance of cell-type decomposition, multiple groups have developed ST deconvolution methods. The aim of this work is to review state-of-the-art methods for ST deconvolution, comparing their strengths and weaknesses. In particular, we construct ST spots from single-cell level ST data to assess the performance of 10 methods, with either ideal reference or non-ideal reference. Furthermore, we examine the performance of these methods on spot- and bead-level ST data by comparing estimated cell-type proportions to carefully matched single-cell ST data. In comparing the performance on various tissues and technological platforms, we concluded that RCTD and stereoscope achieve more robust and accurate inferences.
33822890	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	DeepDRK: a deep learning framework for drug repurposing through kernel-based multi-omics integration.	Recent pharmacogenomic studies that generate sequencing data coupled with pharmacological characteristics for patient-derived cancer cell lines led to large amounts of multi-omics data for precision cancer medicine. Among various obstacles hindering clinical translation, lacking effective methods for multimodal and multisource data integration is becoming a bottleneck. Here we proposed DeepDRK, a machine learning framework for deciphering drug response through kernel-based data integration. To transfer information among different drugs and cancer types, we trained deep neural networks on more than 20 000 pan-cancer cell line-anticancer drug pairs. These pairs were characterized by kernel-based similarity matrices integrating multisource and multi-omics data including genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, chemical properties of compounds and known drug-target interactions. Applied to benchmark cancer cell line datasets, our model surpassed previous approaches with higher accuracy and better robustness. Then we applied our model on newly established patient-derived cancer cell lines and achieved satisfactory performance with AUC of 0.84 and AUPRC of 0.77. Moreover, DeepDRK was used to predict clinical response of cancer patients. Notably, the prediction of DeepDRK correlated well with clinical outcome of patients and revealed multiple drug repurposing candidates. In sum, DeepDRK provided a computational method to predict drug response of cancer cells from integrating pharmacogenomic datasets, offering an alternative way to prioritize repurposing drugs in precision cancer treatment. The DeepDRK is freely available via https://github.com/wangyc82/DeepDRK.
35238331	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	MultiBaC: an R package to remove batch effects in multi-omic experiments.	MOTIVATION: Batch effects in omics datasets are usually a source of technical noise that masks the biological signal and hampers data analysis. Batch effect removal has been widely addressed for individual omics technologies. However, multi-omic datasets may combine data obtained in different batches where omics type and batch are often confounded. Moreover, systematic biases may be introduced without notice during data acquisition, which creates a hidden batch effect. Current methods fail to address batch effect correction in these cases. RESULTS: In this article, we introduce the MultiBaC R package, a tool for batch effect removal in multi-omics and hidden batch effect scenarios. The package includes a diversity of graphical outputs for model validation and assessment of the batch effect correction. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: MultiBaC package is available on Bioconductor (https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MultiBaC.html) and GitHub (https://github.com/ConesaLab/MultiBaC.git). The data underlying this article are available in Gene Expression Omnibus repository (accession numbers GSE11521, GSE1002, GSE56622 and GSE43747). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
38819253	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Multi-modal domain adaptation for revealing spatial functional landscape from spatially resolved transcriptomics.	Spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating gene expression in spatial contexts, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying organ development and disease pathology. However, the expression sparsity poses a computational challenge to integrate other modalities (e.g. histological images and spatial locations) that are simultaneously captured in SRT datasets for spatial clustering and variation analyses. In this study, to meet such a challenge, we propose multi-modal domain adaption for spatial transcriptomics (stMDA), a novel multi-modal unsupervised domain adaptation method, which integrates gene expression and other modalities to reveal the spatial functional landscape. Specifically, stMDA first learns the modality-specific representations from spatial multi-modal data using multiple neural network architectures and then aligns the spatial distributions across modal representations to integrate these multi-modal representations, thus facilitating the integration of global and spatially local information and improving the consistency of clustering assignments. Our results demonstrate that stMDA outperforms existing methods in identifying spatial domains across diverse platforms and species. Furthermore, stMDA excels in identifying spatially variable genes with high prognostic potential in cancer tissues. In conclusion, stMDA as a new tool of multi-modal data integration provides a powerful and flexible framework for analyzing SRT datasets, thereby advancing our understanding of intricate biological systems.
41160880	2025	Nucleic acids research	DeepSpaceDB: a spatial transcriptomics atlas for interactive in-depth analysis of tissues and tissue microenvironments.	Spatial transcriptomics enables detailed mapping of gene expression within tissues, revealing spatial organization of cellular and molecular processes. However, generating such data is costly and technically challenging, and analysis requires advanced bioinformatics skills. Although public datasets are growing, existing databases offer limited tools for interactive exploration and cross-sample comparison. Here, we introduce DeepSpaceDB (www.deepspacedb.com), a next-generation spatial transcriptomics database designed to address these challenges. The current version of DeepSpaceDB focuses on 10X Genomics Visium samples, ensuring higher-quality analyses and enhanced tools. This distinguishes it from databases that prioritize broad platform coverage over functionality. Emphasizing interactivity and advanced analytics, DeepSpaceDB enables flexible exploration of spatial transcriptomics data. Users can interactively compare gene expression across regions within or between tissue slices, such as between hippocampal areas of an Alzheimer's model mouse and a control. The database also offers quality indicators, database-wide trends, and interactive visualizations like zoomable plots and hover-based info. Moreover, these functions are not restricted to samples in our database but can also be applied to samples uploaded by users. Combining advanced tools with interactive features, DeepSpaceDB is a powerful resource for spatial transcriptomics, enabling deeper insights into tissue organization and disease biology.
35948369	2022	Genome research	Single-cell multi-omics of human preimplantation embryos shows susceptibility to glucocorticoids.	The preconceptual, intrauterine, and early life environments can have a profound and long-lasting impact on the developmental trajectories and health outcomes of the offspring. Given the relatively low success rates of assisted reproductive technologies (ART;  approximately 25%), additives and adjuvants, such as glucocorticoids, are used to improve the success rate. Considering the dynamic developmental events that occur during this window, these exposures may alter blastocyst formation at a molecular level, and as such, affect not only the viability of the embryo and the ability of the blastocyst to implant, but also the developmental trajectory of the first three cell lineages, ultimately influencing the physiology of the embryo. In this study, we present a comprehensive single-cell transcriptome, methylome, and small RNA atlas in the day 7 human embryo. We show that, despite no change in morphology and developmental features, preimplantation glucocorticoid exposure reprograms the molecular profile of the trophectoderm (TE) lineage, and these changes are associated with an altered metabolic and inflammatory response. Our data also suggest that glucocorticoids can precociously mature the TE sublineages, supported by the presence of extravillous trophoblast markers in the polar sublineage and presence of X Chromosome dosage compensation. Further, we have elucidated that epigenetic regulation-DNA methylation and microRNAs (miRNAs)-likely underlies the transcriptional changes observed. This study suggests that exposures to exogenous compounds during preimplantation may unintentionally reprogram the human embryo, possibly leading to suboptimal development and longer-term health outcomes.
36271868	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	DeepPerVar: a multi-modal deep learning framework for functional interpretation of genetic variants in personal genome.	MOTIVATION: Understanding the functional consequence of genetic variants, especially the non-coding ones, is important but particularly challenging. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) or quantitative trait locus analyses may be subject to limited statistical power and linkage disequilibrium, and thus are less optimal to pinpoint the causal variants. Moreover, most existing machine-learning approaches, which exploit the functional annotations to interpret and prioritize putative causal variants, cannot accommodate the heterogeneity of personal genetic variations and traits in a population study, targeting a specific disease. RESULTS: By leveraging paired whole-genome sequencing data and epigenetic functional assays in a population study, we propose a multi-modal deep learning framework to predict genome-wide quantitative epigenetic signals by considering both personal genetic variations and traits. The proposed approach can further evaluate the functional consequence of non-coding variants on an individual level by quantifying the allelic difference of predicted epigenetic signals. By applying the approach to the ROSMAP cohort studying Alzheimer's disease (AD), we demonstrate that the proposed approach can accurately predict quantitative genome-wide epigenetic signals and in key genomic regions of AD causal genes, learn canonical motifs reported to regulate gene expression of AD causal genes, improve the partitioning heritability analysis and prioritize putative causal variants in a GWAS risk locus. Finally, we release the proposed deep learning model as a stand-alone Python toolkit and a web server. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: https://github.com/lichen-lab/DeepPerVar. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
39322753	2024	Nature methods	Benchmarking algorithms for single-cell multi-omics prediction and integration.	The development of single-cell multi-omics technology has greatly enhanced our understanding of biology, and in parallel, numerous algorithms have been proposed to predict the protein abundance and/or chromatin accessibility of cells from single-cell transcriptomic information and to integrate various types of single-cell multi-omics data. However, few studies have systematically compared and evaluated the performance of these algorithms. Here, we present a benchmark study of 14 protein abundance/chromatin accessibility prediction algorithms and 18 single-cell multi-omics integration algorithms using 47 single-cell multi-omics datasets. Our benchmark study showed overall totalVI and scArches outperformed the other algorithms for predicting protein abundance, and LS_Lab was the top-performing algorithm for the prediction of chromatin accessibility in most cases. Seurat, MOJITOO and scAI emerge as leading algorithms for vertical integration, whereas totalVI and UINMF excel beyond their counterparts in both horizontal and mosaic integration scenarios. Additionally, we provide a pipeline to assist researchers in selecting the optimal multi-omics prediction and integration algorithm.
35536255	2022	Nucleic acids research	Reconstructing physical cell interaction networks from single-cell data using Neighbor-seq.	Cell-cell interactions are the fundamental building blocks of tissue organization and multicellular life. We developed Neighbor-seq, a method to identify and annotate the architecture of direct cell-cell interactions and relevant ligand-receptor signaling from the undissociated cell fractions in massively parallel single cell sequencing data. Neighbor-seq accurately identifies microanatomical features of diverse tissue types such as the small intestinal epithelium, terminal respiratory tract, and splenic white pulp. It also captures the differing topologies of cancer-immune-stromal cell communications in pancreatic and skin tumors, which are consistent with the patterns observed in spatial transcriptomic data. Neighbor-seq is fast and scalable. It draws inferences from routine single-cell data and does not require prior knowledge about sample cell-types or multiplets. Neighbor-seq provides a framework to study the organ-level cellular interactome in health and disease, bridging the gap between single-cell and spatial transcriptomics.
39708837	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	A review of deep learning models for the prediction of chromatin interactions with DNA and epigenomic profiles.	Advances in three-dimensional (3D) genomics have revealed the spatial characteristics of chromatin interactions in gene expression regulation, which is crucial for understanding molecular mechanisms in biological processes. High-throughput technologies like ChIA-PET, Hi-C, and their derivatives methods have greatly enhanced our knowledge of 3D chromatin architecture. However, the chromatin interaction mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Deep learning, with its powerful feature extraction and pattern recognition capabilities, offers a promising approach for integrating multi-omics data, to build accurate predictive models of chromatin interaction matrices. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in chromatin interaction matrix prediction models. By integrating DNA sequences and epigenetic signals, we investigate the latest developments in these methods. This article details various models, focusing on how one-dimensional (1D) information transforms into the 3D structure chromatin interactions, and how the integration of different deep learning modules specifically affects model accuracy. Additionally, we discuss the critical role of DNA sequence information and epigenetic markers in shaping 3D genome interaction patterns. Finally, this review addresses the challenges in predicting chromatin interaction matrices, in order to improve the precise mapping of chromatin interaction matrices and DNA sequence, and supporting the transformation and theoretical development of 3D genomics across biological systems.
34097004	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	DevOmics: an integrated multi-omics database of human and mouse early embryo.	Transcriptomic and epigenetic alterations during early embryo development have been proven to play essential roles in regulating the cell fate. Nowadays, advances in single-cell transcriptomics and epigenomics profiling techniques provide large volumes of data for understanding the molecular regulatory mechanisms in early embryos and facilitate the investigation of assisted reproductive technology as well as preimplantation genetic testing. However, the lack of integrated data collection and unified analytic procedures greatly limits their usage in scientific research and clinical application. Hence, it is necessary to establish a database integrating the regulatory information of human and mouse early embryos with unified analytic procedures. Here, we introduce DevOmics (http://devomics.cn/), which contains normalized gene expression, DNA methylation, histone modifications (H3K4me3, H3K9me3, H3K27me3, H3K27ac), chromatin accessibility and 3D chromatin architecture profiles of human and mouse early embryos spanning six developmental stages (zygote, 2cell, 4cell, 8cell, morula and blastocyst (ICM, TE)). The current version of DevOmics provides Search and Advanced Search for retrieving genes a researcher is interested in, Analysis Tools including the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analysis for acquiring DEGs between different types of samples, allelic explorer for displaying allele-specific gene expression as well as epigenetic modifications and correlation analysis for showing the dynamic changes in different layers of data across developmental stages, as well as Genome Browser and Ortholog for visualization. DevOmics offers a user-friendly website for biologists and clinicians to decipher molecular regulatory mechanisms of human and mouse early embryos.
40662796	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Anomaly detection in spatial transcriptomics via spatially localized density comparison.	MOTIVATION: Perturbations in biological tissues-e.g. due to inflammation, disease, or drug treatment-alter the composition of cell types and cell states in the tissue. These alterations are often spatially localized in different regions of a tissue, and can be measured using spatial transcriptomics technologies. However, current methods to analyze differential abundance in cell types or cell states, either do not incorporate spatial information-and thus cannot identify spatially localized alterations-or use heuristic and inaccurate approaches. RESULTS: We introduce Spatial Anomaly Region Detection in Expression Manifolds (Sardine), a method to estimate spatially localized changes in spatial transcriptomics data obtained from tissue slices from two or more conditions. Sardine estimates the probability of a cell state being at the same (relative) spatial location between different conditions using spatially localized density estimation. On simulated data, Sardine recapitulates the spatial patterning of expression changes more accurately than existing approaches. On a Visium dataset of the mouse cerebral cortex before and after injury response, as well as on a Visium dataset of a mouse spinal cord undergoing electrotherapy, Sardine identifies regions of spatially localized expression changes that are more biologically plausible than alternative approaches. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: We implement Sardine in Python 3, with an open source implementation available at: https://github.com/raphael-group/spatial_anomaly_detection.
39841593	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Spatially aligned graph transfer learning for characterizing spatial regulatory heterogeneity.	Spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) technologies facilitate the exploration of cell fates or states within tissue microenvironments. Despite these advances, the field has not adequately addressed the regulatory heterogeneity influenced by microenvironmental factors. Here, we propose a novel Spatially Aligned Graph Transfer Learning (SpaGTL), pretrained on a large-scale multi-modal SRT data of about 100 million cells/spots to enable inference of context-specific spatial gene regulatory networks across multiple scales in data-limited settings. As a novel cross-dimensional transfer learning architecture, SpaGTL aligns spatial graph representations across gene-level graph transformers and cell/spot-level manifold-dominated variational autoencoder. This alignment facilitates the exploration of microenvironmental variations in cell types and functional domains from a molecular regulatory perspective, all within a self-supervised framework. We verified SpaGTL's precision, robustness, and speed over existing state-of-the-art algorithms and show SpaGTL's potential that facilitates the discovery of novel regulatory programs that exhibit strong associations with tissue functional regions and cell types. Importantly, SpaGTL could be extended to process multi-slice SRT data and map molecular regulatory landscape associated with three-dimensional spatial-temporal changes during development.
34308480	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	scAdapt: virtual adversarial domain adaptation network for single cell RNA-seq data classification across platforms and species.	In single cell analyses, cell types are conventionally identified based on expressions of known marker genes, whose identifications are time-consuming and irreproducible. To solve this issue, many supervised approaches have been developed to identify cell types based on the rapid accumulation of public datasets. However, these approaches are sensitive to batch effects or biological variations since the data distributions are different in cross-platforms or species predictions. In this study, we developed scAdapt, a virtual adversarial domain adaptation network, to transfer cell labels between datasets with batch effects. scAdapt used both the labeled source and unlabeled target data to train an enhanced classifier and aligned the labeled source centroids and pseudo-labeled target centroids to generate a joint embedding. The scAdapt was demonstrated to outperform existing methods for classification in simulated, cross-platforms, cross-species, spatial transcriptomic and COVID-19 immune datasets. Further quantitative evaluations and visualizations for the aligned embeddings confirm the superiority in cell mixing and the ability to preserve discriminative cluster structure present in the original datasets.
37798250	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Interpretable modeling of time-resolved single-cell gene-protein expression with CrossmodalNet.	Cell-surface proteins play a critical role in cell function and are primary targets for therapeutics. CITE-seq is a single-cell technique that enables simultaneous measurement of gene and surface protein expression. It is powerful but costly and technically challenging. Computational methods have been developed to predict surface protein expression using gene expression information such as from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Existing methods however are computationally demanding and lack the interpretability to reveal underlying biological processes. We propose CrossmodalNet, an interpretable machine learning model, to predict surface protein expression from scRNA-seq data. Our model with a customized adaptive loss accurately predicts surface protein abundances. When samples from multiple time points are given, our model encodes temporal information into an easy-to-interpret time embedding to make prediction in a time-point-specific manner, and is able to uncover noise-free causal gene-protein relationships. Using three publicly available time-resolved CITE-seq data sets, we validate the performance of our model by comparing it with benchmarking methods and evaluate its interpretability. Together, we show that our method accurately and interpretably profiles surface protein expression using scRNA-seq data, thereby expanding the capacity of CITE-seq experiments for investigating molecular mechanisms involving surface proteins.
41125446	2025	Genome research	Polyomino reconstructs spatial transcriptomic profiles with single-cell resolution via a region-allocation method.	Integration of single-cell and spatial transcriptomes represents a fundamental strategy to enhance spatial data quality. However, existing methods for mapping single-cell data to spatial coordinates struggle with large-scale data sets comprising millions of cells. Here, we introduce Polyomino, an intelligent region-allocation method inspired by the region-of-interest (ROI) concept from image processing. By using gradient descent, Polyomino allocates cells to structured spatial regions that match the most significant biological information, optimizing the integration of data and improving speed and accuracy. Polyomino excels in integrating data even in the presence of various sequencing artifacts, such as cell segmentation errors and imbalanced cell-type representations. Polyomino outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 10 to 1000 times in speed, and it is the only approach capable of integrating data sets containing millions of cells in a single run. As a result, Polyomino uncovers originally hidden gene expression patterns in brain sections and offers new insights into organogenesis and tumor microenvironments, all with exceptional efficiency and accuracy.
39196755	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Deep5hmC: predicting genome-wide 5-hydroxymethylcytosine landscape via a multimodal deep learning model.	MOTIVATION: 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), a crucial epigenetic mark with a significant role in regulating tissue-specific gene expression, is essential for understanding the dynamic functions of the human genome. Despite its importance, predicting 5hmC modification across the genome remains a challenging task, especially when considering the complex interplay between DNA sequences and various epigenetic factors such as histone modifications and chromatin accessibility. RESULTS: Using tissue-specific 5hmC sequencing data, we introduce Deep5hmC, a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates both the DNA sequence and epigenetic features such as histone modification and chromatin accessibility to predict genome-wide 5hmC modification. The multimodal design of Deep5hmC demonstrates remarkable improvement in predicting both qualitative and quantitative 5hmC modification compared to unimodal versions of Deep5hmC and state-of-the-art machine learning methods. This improvement is demonstrated through benchmarking on a comprehensive set of 5hmC sequencing data collected at four developmental stages during forebrain organoid development and across 17 human tissues. Compared to DeepSEA and random forest, Deep5hmC achieves close to 4% and 17% improvement of Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) across four forebrain developmental stages, and 6% and 27% across 17 human tissues for predicting binary 5hmC modification sites; and 8% and 22% improvement of Spearman correlation coefficient across four forebrain developmental stages, and 17% and 30% across 17 human tissues for predicting continuous 5hmC modification. Notably, Deep5hmC showcases its practical utility by accurately predicting gene expression and identifying differentially hydroxymethylated regions (DhMRs) in a case-control study of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Deep5hmC significantly improves our understanding of tissue-specific gene regulation and facilitates the development of new biomarkers for complex diseases. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Deep5hmC is available via https://github.com/lichen-lab/Deep5hmC.
41062448	2025	Nucleic acids research	So3D: a comprehensive three-dimensional spatial omics resource for decoding tissue architecture in physiology and disease.	Cells function within intricate three-dimensional (3D) architectures to form tissues and organs. Constructing 3D tissue structure is critical for understanding cellular states, biological processes, and intercellular interactions. Herein, we describe a comprehensive 3D spatial omics resource, So3D (http://bio-bigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/So3D or https://so3d.bio-database.com/), which aims to construct 3D tissue architecture and dissect biological processes occurring in 3D space from multiple perspectives. We systematically collected 72 sets of 3D spatial transcriptome datasets, involving 1 132 902 spots across 882 slices from four species, and matched reference single-cell RNA-sequencing data, covering 763 893 cells from 28 datasets. So3D also provides multiple flexible analysis modules for retrieving and analyzing 3D tissue, such as inference of 3D spatial domains and gene expression patterns across 3D tissue regions, 2D spatial slices, and single-cell datasets; mapping of cell type distribution and cell-cell communication networks to explore intercellular crosstalk in 3D space; and functional annotation of biological pathways and signaling networks within 3D tissue contexts. Collectively, So3D provides comprehensive insights for investigating biologically meaningful 3D spatial domains, mapping local gene expression landscapes, functional state, and communication networks in tissue, and may also serve as an efficient and reliable tool for understanding the tissue microenvironment and discovering biomarkers.
38171928	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	SGCAST: symmetric graph convolutional auto-encoder for scalable and accurate study of spatial transcriptomics.	Recent advances in spatial transcriptomics (ST) have enabled comprehensive profiling of gene expression with spatial information in the context of the tissue microenvironment. However, with the improvements in the resolution and scale of ST data, deciphering spatial domains precisely while ensuring efficiency and scalability is still challenging. Here, we develop SGCAST, an efficient auto-encoder framework to identify spatial domains. SGCAST adopts a symmetric graph convolutional auto-encoder to learn aggregated latent embeddings via integrating the gene expression similarity and the proximity of the spatial spots. This framework in SGCAST enables a mini-batch training strategy, which makes SGCAST memory-efficient and scalable to high-resolution spatial transcriptomic data with a large number of spots. SGCAST improves the overall accuracy of spatial domain identification on benchmarking data. We also validated the performance of SGCAST on ST datasets at various scales across multiple platforms. Our study illustrates the superior capacity of SGCAST on analyzing spatial transcriptomic data.
41045512	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Denoising spatially resolved transcriptomics with consistency of heterogeneous spatial coordinates, transcription, and morphology.	Spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) simultaneously captures spatial coordinates, pathological features, and transcriptional profiles of cells within intact tissues, offering unprecedented opportunities to explore tissue architecture. However, SRT data often suffer from substantial technical noise introduced by experimental procedures, posing challenges for downstream analyses. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a Multiview Denoising framework for Spatial Transcriptomics (MvDST), which integrates a deep autoencoder and self-supervised learning to jointly reconstruct expression profiles, denoise features, and enforce cross-view consistency, effectively reducing technical noise, and heterogeneity. As a result, MvDST reliably and accurately delineates tissue subgroups across simulated datasets under various perturbations. In real cancer datasets, it distinguishes tumor-associated domains, identifies region-specific marker genes, and reveals intra-tumoral heterogeneity. Furthermore, we validate the robustness of MvDST across multiple spatial transcriptomics platforms, including 10 $\times $ Visium, STARmap, and osmFISH. Overall, these results demonstrate that MvDST can serve as a crucial initial step for the analysis of spatially resolved transcriptomics data.
40275395	2025	Genome biology	InSituCor: exploring spatially correlated genes conditional on the cell type landscape.	In spatial transcriptomics data, spatially correlated genes promise to reveal high-interest phenomena like cell-cell interactions and latent variables. But in practice, most spatial correlations arise from the spatial arrangement of cell types, obscuring the more interesting relationships we hope to discover. We introduce InSituCor, a toolkit for discovering modules of spatially correlated genes. InSituCor returns only correlations not explainable by already-known factors like the cell type landscape; this spares precious analyst effort. InSituCor supports both unbiased discovery of whole-dataset correlations and knowledge-driven exploration of genes of interest. As a special case, it evaluates ligand-receptor pairs for spatial co-regulation.
33974036	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Multimodal regularized linear models with flux balance analysis for mechanistic integration of omics data.	MOTIVATION: High-throughput biological data, thanks to technological advances, have become cheaper to collect, leading to the availability of vast amounts of omic data of different types. In parallel, the in silico reconstruction and modeling of metabolic systems is now acknowledged as a key tool to complement experimental data on a large scale. The integration of these model- and data-driven information is therefore emerging as a new challenge in systems biology, with no clear guidance on how to better take advantage of the inherent multisource and multiomic nature of these data types while preserving mechanistic interpretation. RESULTS: Here, we investigate different regularization techniques for high-dimensional data derived from the integration of gene expression profiles with metabolic flux data, extracted from strain-specific metabolic models, to improve cellular growth rate predictions. To this end, we propose ad-hoc extensions of previous regularization frameworks including group, view-specific and principal component regularization and experimentally compare them using data from 1143 Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. We observe a divergence between methods in terms of regression accuracy and integration effectiveness based on the type of regularization employed. In multiomic regression tasks, when learning from experimental and model-generated omic data, our results demonstrate the competitiveness and ease of interpretation of multimodal regularized linear models compared to data-hungry methods based on neural networks. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: All data, models and code produced in this work are available on GitHub at https://github.com/Angione-Lab/HybridGroupIPFLasso_pc2Lasso. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
40841173	2025	Genome research	Deciphering context-specific gene programs from single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data with DeCEP.	Functional gene programs play a wide range of roles in health and disease by orchestrating transcriptional coregulation to govern cell identity. Understanding these intricate gene programs is essential for unraveling the complexities of biological systems; however, deciphering them remains a significant challenge. Recent advancements in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies have empowered the comprehensive characterization of gene programs at both single-cell and spatial resolutions. Here, we present DeCEP, a computational framework designed to characterize context-specific gene programs using scRNA-seq and ST data. DeCEP leverages functional gene lists and directed graphs to construct functional networks underlying distinct cellular or spatial contexts. It then identifies context-dependent hub genes associated with specific gene programs based on network topology and assigns gene program activity to individual cells or spatial locations. Through evaluation on both simulated and real biological data sets, DeCEP demonstrates complementary strengths over existing methods by enabling more fine-grained characterization of gene programs within specific contexts, particularly those characterized by pronounced transcriptional heterogeneity. Furthermore, we showcase the ability of DeCEP in elucidating biological insights through case studies on normal liver tissue, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer.
21666268	2011	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	MGV: a generic graph viewer for comparative omics data.	MOTIVATION: High-throughput transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics methods have revolutionized our knowledge of biological systems. To gain knowledge from comparative omics studies, strong data integration and visualization features are required. Knowledge gained from these studies is often available in the form of graphs, and their visualization is especially useful in a wide range of systems biology topics, including pathway analysis, interaction networks or gene models. Especially, it is necessary to compare biological models with measured data. This allows the identification of new models and new insights into existing ones. RESULTS: We present MGV, a versatile generic graph viewer for multiomics data. MGV is integrated into Mayday (Battke et al., 2010). It extends Mayday's visual analytics capabilities by integrating a wide range of biological models, high-throughput data and meta information to display enriched graphs that combine data and models. A wide range of tools is available for visualization of nodes, data-aware graph layout as well as automatic and manual aggregation and refinement of the data. We show the usefulness of MGV applied to several problems, including differential expression of alternative transcripts, transcription factor interaction, cross-study clustering comparison and integration of transcriptomics and metabolomics data for pathway analysis. AVAILABILITY: MGV is a open-source software implemented in Java and freely available as a part of Mayday at www.microarray-analysis.org/mayday.

35058621	2022	Nature biotechnology	scJoint integrates atlas-scale single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data with transfer learning.	Single-cell multiomics data continues to grow at an unprecedented pace. Although several methods have demonstrated promising results in integrating several data modalities from the same tissue, the complexity and scale of data compositions present in cell atlases still pose a challenge. Here, we present scJoint, a transfer learning method to integrate atlas-scale, heterogeneous collections of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data. scJoint leverages information from annotated scRNA-seq data in a semisupervised framework and uses a neural network to simultaneously train labeled and unlabeled data, allowing label transfer and joint visualization in an integrative framework. Using atlas data as well as multimodal datasets generated with ASAP-seq and CITE-seq, we demonstrate that scJoint is computationally efficient and consistently achieves substantially higher cell-type label accuracy than existing methods while providing meaningful joint visualizations. Thus, scJoint overcomes the heterogeneity of different data modalities to enable a more comprehensive understanding of cellular phenotypes.
38755322	2024	Nature methods	Spatial transition tensor of single cells.	Spatial transcriptomics and messenger RNA splicing encode extensive spatiotemporal information for cell states and transitions. The current lineage-inference methods either lack spatial dynamics for state transition or cannot capture different dynamics associated with multiple cell states and transition paths. Here we present spatial transition tensor (STT), a method that uses messenger RNA splicing and spatial transcriptomes through a multiscale dynamical model to characterize multistability in space. By learning a four-dimensional transition tensor and spatial-constrained random walk, STT reconstructs cell-state-specific dynamics and spatial state transitions via both short-time local tensor streamlines between cells and long-time transition paths among attractors. Benchmarking and applications of STT on several transcriptome datasets via multiple technologies on epithelial-mesenchymal transitions, blood development, spatially resolved mouse brain and chicken heart development, indicate STT's capability in recovering cell-state-specific dynamics and their associated genes not seen using existing methods. Overall, STT provides a consistent multiscale description of single-cell transcriptome data across multiple spatiotemporal scales.
40185158	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Deep learning in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data analysis: advances and challenges from a data science perspective.	The development of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics has revolutionized our capacity to investigate cellular properties, functions, and interactions in both cellular and spatial contexts. Despite this progress, the analysis of single-cell and spatial omics data remains challenging. First, single-cell sequencing data are high-dimensional and sparse, and are often contaminated by noise and uncertainty, obscuring the underlying biological signal. Second, these data often encompass multiple modalities, including gene expression, epigenetic modifications, metabolite levels, and spatial locations. Integrating these diverse data modalities is crucial for enhancing prediction accuracy and biological interpretability. Third, while the scale of single-cell sequencing has expanded to millions of cells, high-quality annotated datasets are still limited. Fourth, the complex correlations of biological tissues make it difficult to accurately reconstruct cellular states and spatial contexts. Traditional feature engineering approaches struggle with the complexity of biological networks, while deep learning, with its ability to handle high-dimensional data and automatically identify meaningful patterns, has shown great promise in overcoming these challenges. Besides systematically reviewing the strengths and weaknesses of advanced deep learning methods, we have curated 21 datasets from nine benchmarks to evaluate the performance of 58 computational methods. Our analysis reveals that model performance can vary significantly across different benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics, providing a useful perspective for selecting the most appropriate approach based on a specific application scenario. We highlight three key areas for future development, offering valuable insights into how deep learning can be effectively applied to transcriptomic data analysis in biological, medical, and clinical settings.
39817519	2025	Nucleic acids research	Mapping the spatial atlas of the human bone tissue integrating spatial and single-cell transcriptomics.	Bone is a multifaceted tissue requiring orchestrated interplays of diverse cells within specialized microenvironments. Although significant progress has been made in understanding cellular and molecular mechanisms of component cells of bone, revealing their spatial organization and interactions in native bone tissue microenvironment is crucial for advancing precision medicine, as they govern fundamental signaling pathways and functional dependencies among various bone cells. In this study, we present the first integrative high-resolution map of human bone and bone marrow, using spatial and single-cell transcriptomics profiling from femoral tissue. This multi-modal approach discovered a novel bone formation-specialized niche enriched with osteoblastic lineage cells and fibroblasts and unveiled critical cell-cell communications and co-localization patterns between osteoblastic lineage cells and other cells. Furthermore, we discovered a novel spatial gradient of cellular composition, gene expression and signaling pathway activities radiating from the trabecular bone. This comprehensive atlas delineates the intricate bone cellular architecture and illuminates key molecular processes and dependencies among cells that coordinate bone metabolism. In sum, our study provides an essential reference for the field of bone biology and lays the foundation for advanced mechanistic studies and precision medicine approaches in bone-related disorders.
37843152	2024	Nucleic acids research	TCOD: an integrated resource for tropical crops.	Tropical crops are vital for tropical agriculture, with resource scarcity, functional diversity and extensive market demand, providing considerable economic benefits for the world's tropical agriculture-producing countries. The rapid development of sequencing technology has promoted a milestone in tropical crop research, resulting in the generation of massive amount of data, which urgently needs an effective platform for data integration and sharing. However, the existing databases cannot fully satisfy researchers' requirements due to the relatively limited integration level and untimely update. Here, we present the Tropical Crop Omics Database (TCOD, https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/tcod), a comprehensive multi-omics data platform for tropical crops. TCOD integrates diverse omics data from 15 species, encompassing 34 chromosome-level de novo assemblies, 1 255 004 genes with functional annotations, 282 436 992 unique variants from 2048 WGS samples, 88 transcriptomic profiles from 1997 RNA-Seq samples and 13 381 germplasm items. Additionally, TCOD not only employs genes as a bridge to interconnect multi-omics data, enabling cross-species comparisons based on homology relationships, but also offers user-friendly online tools for efficient data mining and visualization. In short, TCOD integrates multi-species, multi-omics data and online tools, which will facilitate the research on genomic selective breeding and trait biology of tropical crops.
33875866	2021	Nature biotechnology	Iterative single-cell multi-omic integration using online learning.	Integrating large single-cell gene expression, chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation datasets requires general and scalable computational approaches. Here we describe online integrative non-negative matrix factorization (iNMF), an algorithm for integrating large, diverse and continually arriving single-cell datasets. Our approach scales to arbitrarily large numbers of cells using fixed memory, iteratively incorporates new datasets as they are generated and allows many users to simultaneously analyze a single copy of a large dataset by streaming it over the internet. Iterative data addition can also be used to map new data to a reference dataset. Comparisons with previous methods indicate that the improvements in efficiency do not sacrifice dataset alignment and cluster preservation performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of online iNMF by integrating more than 1 million cells on a standard laptop, integrating large single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomic datasets, and iteratively constructing a single-cell multi-omic atlas of the mouse motor cortex.
36625255	2023	Nucleic acids research	ONECUT2 regulates RANKL-dependent enterocyte and microfold cell differentiation in the small intestine; a multi-omics study.	Microfold (M) cells reside in the intestinal epithelium of Peyer's patches (PP). Their unique ability to take up and transport antigens from the intestinal lumen to the underlying lymphoid tissue is key in the regulation of the gut-associated immune response. Here, we applied a multi-omics approach to investigate the molecular mechanisms that drive M cell differentiation in mouse small intestinal organoids. We generated a comprehensive profile of chromatin accessibility changes and transcription factor dynamics during in vitro M cell differentiation, allowing us to uncover numerous cell type-specific regulatory elements and associated transcription factors. By using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified an enterocyte and M cell precursor population. We used our newly developed computational tool SCEPIA to link precursor cell-specific gene expression to transcription factor motif activity in cis-regulatory elements, uncovering high expression of and motif activity for the transcription factor ONECUT2. Subsequent in vitro and in vivo perturbation experiments revealed that ONECUT2 acts downstream of the RANK/RANKL signalling axis to support enterocyte differentiation, thereby restricting M cell lineage specification. This study sheds new light on the mechanism regulating cell fate balance in the PP, and it provides a powerful blueprint for investigation of cell fate switches in the intestinal epithelium.
38647109	2024	Nucleic acids research	High-density generation of spatial transcriptomics with STAGE.	Spatial transcriptome technologies have enabled the measurement of gene expression while maintaining spatial location information for deciphering the spatial heterogeneity of biological tissues. However, they were heavily limited by the sparse spatial resolution and low data quality. To this end, we develop a spatial location-supervised auto-encoder generator STAGE for generating high-density spatial transcriptomics (ST). STAGE takes advantage of the customized supervised auto-encoder to learn continuous patterns of gene expression in space and generate high-resolution expressions for given spatial coordinates. STAGE can improve the low quality of spatial transcriptome data and smooth the generated manifold of gene expression through the de-noising function on the latent codes of the auto-encoder. Applications to four ST datasets, STAGE has shown better recovery performance for down-sampled data than existing methods, revealed significant tissue structure specificity, and enabled robust identification of spatially informative genes and patterns. In addition, STAGE can be extended to three-dimensional (3D) stacked ST data for generating gene expression at any position between consecutive sections for shaping high-density 3D ST configuration.
41091889	2025	Nucleic acids research	iFish: a comprehensive multi-omics database for fish genetics, transcriptional regulation, and epigenetic research.	The explosive expansion of fish multi-omics data is reshaping basic and applied research in fisheries and aquaculture. Here, we introduce iFish, a rigorously curated and comprehensive resource that integrates genome, transcriptome, epigenome, and proteome datasets from 88 fish species. From 884 whole-genome sequencing datasets, we identified 137.04 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms and 45.52 million insertions/deletions. Leveraging 9797 bulk RNA-seq, 293 single-cell RNA-seq, and 840 microRNA (miRNA)-seq datasets, we quantified 1.87 million messenger RNAs, 287 873 long noncoding RNAs, 197 554 circular RNAs, and 6068 mature miRNAs across different tissues of multiple species. By integrating 1563 epigenetics sequencing datasets, we provided genome-wide maps of histone modifications, chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation, and three-dimensional chromatin interactions. Furthermore, 50 proteomics projects were included for protein expression profiling. In addition, to facilitate gene analyses, we also curated 2.7 million gene annotation entries, identified homologous genes, annotated 192 107 transcription factors (TFs), constructed TF regulatory networks and gene co-expression networks, and performed cross-species conservation analyses of noncoding RNAs. Finally, we established the iFish database (https://gonglab.hzau.edu.cn/iFish/), a user-friendly platform that supports interactive browsing, visualization, and download. With comprehensive data and useful tools, iFish will advance genetic, transcriptional-regulatory, and epigenetic investigations, and accelerate genetic improvement and practical applications in aquaculture.
38012720	2023	Genome biology	Single-cell multiomics of the human retina reveals hierarchical transcription factor collaboration in mediating cell type-specific effects of genetic variants on gene regulation.	BACKGROUND: Systematic characterization of how  genetic variation modulates gene regulation in a cell type-specific context is essential for understanding complex traits. To address this question, we profile gene expression and chromatin accessibility in cells from healthy retinae of 20 human donors through single-cell multiomics and genomic sequencing. RESULTS: We map eQTL, caQTL, allelic-specific expression, and allelic-specific chromatin accessibility in major retinal cell types. By integrating these results, we identify and characterize regulatory elements and genetic variants effective on gene regulation in individual cell types. The majority of identified sc-eQTLs and sc-caQTLs display cell type-specific effects, while the cis-elements containing genetic variants with cell type-specific effects are often accessible in multiple cell types. Furthermore, the transcription factors whose binding sites are perturbed by genetic variants tend to have higher expression levels in the cell types where the variants exert their effects, compared to the cell types where the variants have no impact. We further validate our findings with high-throughput reporter assays. Lastly, we identify the enriched cell types, candidate causal variants and genes, and cell type-specific regulatory mechanism underlying GWAS loci. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, genetic effects on gene regulation are highly context dependent. Our results suggest that cell type-dependent genetic effect is driven by precise modulation of both trans-factor expression and chromatin accessibility of cis-elements. Our findings indicate hierarchical collaboration among transcription factors plays a crucial role in mediating cell type-specific effects of genetic variants on gene regulation.
40148595	2025	Nature biotechnology	Spatial transcriptomic imaging of an intact organism using volumetric DNA microscopy.	Lymphatic, nervous and tumor tissues exhibit complex physiology arising from three-dimensional interactions within genetically unique microenvironments. Here we develop a technology capable of volumetrically imaging transcriptomes, genotypes and morphologies in a single measurement, without relying on prior knowledge of spatial organization or genetic sequences. Our method extends DNA microscopy into three dimensions at scales involving 10(7) molecules by forming a distributed intermolecular network of proximal unique DNA barcodes tagging complementary DNA molecules inside the specimen. After sequencing the DNA-encoded network, an image of molecular positions is inferred using geodesic spectral embeddings, a dimensionality reduction approach that we show to be especially suitable for this data-inverse problem. Applying whole-transcriptome volumetric DNA microscopy to intact zebrafish embryos, we demonstrate that three-dimensional image inference recapitulates zebrafish morphology and known gene expression patterns, capturing the spatial organization of gene sequences. Our extension of spatial genetic measurements to three dimensions, independent of prior templates, opens the door to detailed joint resolution of genomics and morphology in biological tissues.
34815310	2021	Genome research	Human and rat skeletal muscle single-nuclei multi-omic integrative analyses nominate causal cell types, regulatory elements, and SNPs for complex traits.	Skeletal muscle accounts for the largest proportion of human body mass, on average, and is a key tissue in complex diseases and mobility. It is composed of several different cell and muscle fiber types. Here, we optimize single-nucleus ATAC-seq (snATAC-seq) to map skeletal muscle cell-specific chromatin accessibility landscapes in frozen human and rat samples, and single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) to map cell-specific transcriptomes in human. We additionally perform multi-omics profiling (gene expression and chromatin accessibility) on human and rat muscle samples. We capture type I and type II muscle fiber signatures, which are generally missed by existing single-cell RNA-seq methods. We perform cross-modality and cross-species integrative analyses on 33,862 nuclei and identify seven cell types ranging in abundance from 59.6% to 1.0% of all nuclei. We introduce a regression-based approach to infer cell types by comparing transcription start site-distal ATAC-seq peaks to reference enhancer maps and show consistency with RNA-based marker gene cell type assignments. We find heterogeneity in enrichment of genetic variants linked to complex phenotypes from the UK Biobank and diabetes genome-wide association studies in cell-specific ATAC-seq peaks, with the most striking enrichment patterns in muscle mesenchymal stem cells ( approximately 3.5% of nuclei). Finally, we overlay these chromatin accessibility maps on GWAS data to nominate causal cell types, SNPs, transcription factor motifs, and target genes for type 2 diabetes signals. These chromatin accessibility profiles for human and rat skeletal muscle cell types are a useful resource for nominating causal GWAS SNPs and cell types.
39558175	2025	Nucleic acids research	scCancerExplorer: a comprehensive database for interactively exploring single-cell multi-omics data of human pan-cancer.	Genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic alterations are hallmarks of cancer cells, and are closely connected. Especially, epigenetic regulation plays a critical role in tumorigenesis and progression. The growing single-cell epigenome data in cancer research provide new opportunities for data mining from a more comprehensive perspective. However, there is still a lack of databases designed for interactively exploring the single-cell multi-omics data of human pan-cancer, especially for the single-cell epigenome data. To fill in the gap, we developed scCancerExplorer, a comprehensive and user-friendly database to facilitate the exploration of the single-cell genome, epigenome (chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation), and transcriptome data of 50 cancer types. Five major modules were provided to explore those data interactively, including 'Integrated multi-omics analysis', 'Single-cell transcriptome', 'Single-cell epigenome', 'Single-cell genome' and 'TCGA analysis'. By simple clicking, users can easily investigate gene expression features, chromatin accessibility patterns, transcription factor activities, DNA methylation states, copy number variations and TCGA survival analysis results. Taken together, scCancerExplorer is distinguished from previous databases with rich and interactive functions for exploring the single-cell multi-omics data of human pan-cancer. It bridges the gap between single-cell multi-omics data and the end-users, and will facilitate progress in the field of cancer research. scCancerExplorer is freely accessible via https://bianlab.cn/scCancerExplorer.
34650268	2022	Nature biotechnology	Cell segmentation in imaging-based spatial transcriptomics.	Single-molecule spatial transcriptomics protocols based on in situ sequencing or multiplexed RNA fluorescent hybridization can reveal detailed tissue organization. However, distinguishing the boundaries of individual cells in such data is challenging and can hamper downstream analysis. Current methods generally approximate cells positions using nuclei stains. We describe a segmentation method, Baysor, that optimizes two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) cell boundaries considering joint likelihood of transcriptional composition and cell morphology. While Baysor can take into account segmentation based on co-stains, it can also perform segmentation based on the detected transcripts alone. To evaluate performance, we extend multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) to incorporate immunostaining of cell boundaries. Using this and other benchmarks, we show that Baysor segmentation can, in some cases, nearly double the number of cells compared to existing tools while reducing segmentation artifacts. We demonstrate that Baysor performs well on data acquired using five different protocols, making it a useful general tool for analysis of imaging-based spatial transcriptomics.
34237133	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	A new thinking: extended application of genomic selection to screen multiomics data for development of novel hypoxia-immune biomarkers and target therapy of clear cell renal cell carcinoma.	Increasing evidences show the clinical significance of the interaction between hypoxia and immune in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) microenvironment. However, reliable prognostic signatures based on a combination of hypoxia and immune have not been well established. Moreover, many studies have only used RNA-seq profiles to screen the prognosis feature of ccRCC. Presently, there is no comprehensive analysis of multiomics data to mine a better one. Thus, we try and get it. First, t-SNE and ssGSEA analysis were used to establish tumor subtypes related to hypoxia-immune, and we investigated the hypoxia-immune-related differences in three types of genetic or epigenetic characteristics (gene expression profiles, somatic mutation, and DNA methylation) by analyzing the multiomics data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) portal. Additionally, a four-step strategy based on lasso regression and Cox regression was used to construct a satisfying prognostic model, with average 1-year, 3-year and 5-year areas under the curve (AUCs) equal to 0.806, 0.776 and 0.837. Comparing it with other nine known prognostic biomarkers and clinical prognostic scoring algorithms, the multiomics-based signature performs better. Then, we verified the gene expression differences in two external databases (ICGC and SYSU cohorts). Next, eight hub genes were singled out and seven hub genes were validated as prognostic genes in SYSU cohort. Furthermore, it was indicated high-risk patients have a better response for immunotherapy in immunophenoscore (IPS) analysis and TIDE algorithm. Meanwhile, estimated by GDSC and cMAP database, the high-risk patients showed sensitive responses to six chemotherapy drugs and six candidate small-molecule drugs. In summary, the signature can accurately predict the prognosis of ccRCC and may shed light on the development of novel hypoxia-immune biomarkers and target therapy of ccRCC.
40659497	2025	Genome research	A novel multislice framework for precision 3D spatial domain reconstruction and disease pathology analysis.	The development of spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies has revolutionized the way we map the complex organization and functions of tissues. These technologies offer valuable insights into the organization and function of complex biological systems. However, existing methods often focus too narrowly on single modalities or resolutions, thereby hindering the comprehensive capture of multilayered biological heterogeneity. Here, STMSC is proposed as a multislice joint analysis framework featuring a precorrection mechanism that enables the precise identification of complex spatial domains, advancing disease pathology insights. STMSC assumes that precise three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction is essential for an in-depth investigation of tissue components and mechanisms. Incorporating hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) imaging data, STMSC enhances slice alignment accuracy in 3D reconstruction. By deconstructing microenvironments, it reconstructs fine-grained cellular landscapes and emphasizes collective cellular behavior in defining spatial domains. Its graph attention autoencoder with precorrection balances biological information at different levels, improving the accuracy of ST analyses. By analyzing consecutive tissue slices and pathological data sets, STMSC accurately reconstructs 3D structures and provides deeper insights into complex cancer environments. Specifically, STMSC captures intra- and interstage heterogeneity in cancer development, offering novel insights into the complexity of pathological tissue structures.
39516853	2024	Genome biology	scDOT: optimal transport for mapping senescent cells in spatial transcriptomics.	The low resolution of spatial transcriptomics data necessitates additional information for optimal use. We developed scDOT, which combines spatial transcriptomics and single cell RNA sequencing to improve the ability to reconstruct single cell resolved spatial maps and identify senescent cells. scDOT integrates optimal transport and expression deconvolution to learn non-linear couplings between cells and spots and to infer cell placements. Application of scDOT to lung spatial transcriptomics data improves on prior methods and allows the identification of the spatial organization of senescent cells, their neighboring cells and novel genes involved in cell-cell interactions that may be driving senescence.
41057862	2025	Genome biology	High-precision cell-type mapping and annotation of single-cell spatial transcriptomics with STAMapper.	In this paper, we develop a heterogeneous graph neural network, STAMapper, to transfer the cell-type labels from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to single-cell spatial transcriptomics (scST) data. We collect 81 scST datasets consisting of 344 slices and 16 paired scRNA-seq datasets from eight technologies and five tissues to validate the efficiency of STAMapper. STAMapper achieves the best performance on 75 out of 81 datasets compared to competing methods in accuracy. STAMapper demonstrates enhanced performance over manual annotations, particularly at the boundaries of cell clusters, enables the unknown cell-type detection in scST data, and exhibits precise cell subtype annotations.
40618351	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Spatial histology and gene-expression representation and generative learning via online self-distillation contrastive learning.	Spatial transcriptomics quantifies spatial molecular profiles alongside histology, enabling computational prediction of spatial gene expression distribution directly from whole slide images. Inspired by image-to-text alignment and generation, we introduce Magic, a self-training contrastive learning model designed for histology-to-gene expression prediction. Magic (i) employs contrastive learning to derive shared embeddings for histology and gene expression while utilizing a momentum-based module to generate pseudo-targets to reduce the impact of noise; and (ii) leverages a transformer-based decoder to predict the expression of 300 genes based on histological features. Trained on 75 760 spots from 56 breast cancer slices and validated on 11 026 spots from five independent slices, Magic outperforms existing methods in aligning and generating histology-gene expression data, achieving a 10% improvement over the second-best approach. Furthermore, Magic demonstrates robust generalization, effectively predicting gene expression in colorectal cancer samples and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets through zero-shot learning. Notably, Magic's predicted gene expression captures interpatient differences, highlighting its strong potential for clinical applications.

37903634	2023	Genome research	Latent feature extraction with a prior-based self-attention framework for spatial transcriptomics.	Rapid advances in spatial transcriptomics (ST) have revolutionized the interrogation of spatial heterogeneity and increase the demand for comprehensive methods to effectively characterize spatial domains. As a prerequisite for ST data analysis, spatial domain characterization is a crucial step for downstream analyses and biological implications. Here we propose a prior-based self-attention framework for spatial transcriptomics (PAST), a variational graph convolutional autoencoder for ST, which effectively integrates prior information via a Bayesian neural network, captures spatial patterns via a self-attention mechanism, and enables scalable application via a ripple walk sampler strategy. Through comprehensive experiments on data sets generated by different technologies, we show that PAST can effectively characterize spatial domains and facilitate various downstream analyses, including ST visualization, spatial trajectory inference and pseudotime analysis. Also, we highlight the advantages of PAST for multislice joint embedding and automatic annotation of spatial domains in newly sequenced ST data. Compared with existing methods, PAST is the first ST method that integrates reference data to analyze ST data. We anticipate that PAST will open up new avenues for researchers to decipher ST data with customized reference data, which expands the applicability of ST technology.
38963312	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Reverse network diffusion to remove indirect noise for better inference of gene regulatory networks.	MOTIVATION: Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are vital tools for delineating regulatory relationships between transcription factors and their target genes. The boom in computational biology and various biotechnologies has made inferring GRNs from multi-omics data a hot topic. However, when networks are constructed from gene expression data, they often suffer from false-positive problem due to the transitive effects of correlation. The presence of spurious noise edges obscures the real gene interactions, which makes downstream analyses, such as detecting gene function modules and predicting disease-related genes, difficult and inefficient. Therefore, there is an urgent and compelling need to develop network denoising methods to improve the accuracy of GRN inference. RESULTS: In this study, we proposed a novel network denoising method named REverse Network Diffusion On Random walks (RENDOR). RENDOR is designed to enhance the accuracy of GRNs afflicted by indirect effects. RENDOR takes noisy networks as input, models higher-order indirect interactions between genes by transitive closure, eliminates false-positive effects using the inverse network diffusion method, and produces refined networks as output. We conducted a comparative assessment of GRN inference accuracy before and after denoising on simulated networks and real GRNs. Our results emphasized that the network derived from RENDOR more accurately and effectively captures gene interactions. This study demonstrates the significance of removing network indirect noise and highlights the effectiveness of the proposed method in enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio of noisy networks. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The R package RENDOR is provided at https://github.com/Wu-Lab/RENDOR and other source code and data are available at https://github.com/Wu-Lab/RENDOR-reproduce.
34260718	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	CoSMeD: a user-friendly web server to estimate 5-year survival probability of left-sided and right-sided colorectal cancer patients using molecular data.	SUMMARY: Colorectal cancer is a heterogeneous disease with diverse prognoses between left-sided and right-sided patients; therefore, it is necessary to precisely evaluate the survival probability of side-specific colorectal cancer patients. Here, we collected multi-omics data from The Cancer Genome Atlas program, including gene expression, DNA methylation and microRNA expression. Specificity measure and robust likelihood-based survival analysis were used to identify 6 left-sided and 28 right-sided prognostic biomarkers. Compared to the performance of clinical prognostic models, the addition of these biomarkers could significantly improve the discriminatory ability and calibration in predicting side-specific 5-year survival for colorectal cancer. Additional dataset derived from Gene Expression Omnibus was used to validate the prognostic value of side-specific genes. Finally, we constructed colorectal cancer side-specific molecular database (CoSMeD), a user-friendly interface for estimating side-specific colorectal cancer 5-year survival probability, which can lay the basis for personalized management of left-sided and right-sided colorectal cancer patients. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: CoSMeD is freely available at https://mulongdu.shinyapps.io/cosmed. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

32743640	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	Irinotecan and vandetanib create synergies for treatment of pancreatic cancer patients with concomitant TP53 and KRAS mutations.	BACKGROUND: The most frequently mutated gene pairs in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) are KRAS and TP53, and our goal is to illustrate the multiomics and molecular dynamics landscapes of KRAS/TP53 mutation and also to obtain prospective novel drugs for KRAS- and TP53-mutated PAAD patients. Moreover, we also made an attempt to discover the probable link amid KRAS and TP53 on the basis of the abovementioned multiomics data. METHOD: We utilized TCGA & Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia data for the analysis of KRAS/TP53 mutation in a multiomics manner. In addition to that, we performed molecular dynamics analysis of KRAS and TP53 to produce mechanistic descriptions of particular mutations and carcinogenesis. RESULT: We discover that there is a significant difference in the genomics, transcriptomics, methylomics, and molecular dynamics pattern of KRAS and TP53 mutation from the matching wild type in PAAD, and the prognosis of pancreatic cancer is directly linked with a particular mutation of KRAS and protein stability. Screened drugs are potentially effective in PAAD patients. CONCLUSIONS: KRAS and TP53 prognosis of PAAD is directly associated with a specific mutation of KRAS. Irinotecan and vandetanib are prospective drugs for PAAD patients with KRASG12Dmutation and TP53 mutation.
38669236	2024	PLoS computational biology	Spatial transcriptome-guided multi-scale framework connects P. aeruginosa metabolic states to oxidative stress biofilm microenvironment.	With the generation of spatially resolved transcriptomics of microbial biofilms, computational tools can be used to integrate this data to elucidate the multi-scale mechanisms controlling heterogeneous biofilm metabolism. This work presents a Multi-scale model of Metabolism In Cellular Systems (MiMICS) which is a computational framework that couples a genome-scale metabolic network reconstruction (GENRE) with Hybrid Automata Library (HAL), an existing agent-based model and reaction-diffusion model platform. A key feature of MiMICS is the ability to incorporate multiple -omics-guided metabolic models, which can represent unique metabolic states that yield different metabolic parameter values passed to the extracellular models. We used MiMICS to simulate Pseudomonas aeruginosa regulation of denitrification and oxidative stress metabolism in hypoxic and nitric oxide (NO) biofilm microenvironments. Integration of P. aeruginosa PA14 biofilm spatial transcriptomic data into a P. aeruginosa PA14 GENRE generated four PA14 metabolic model states that were input into MiMICS. Characteristic of aerobic, denitrification, and oxidative stress metabolism, the four metabolic model states predicted different oxygen, nitrate, and NO exchange fluxes that were passed as inputs to update the agent's local metabolite concentrations in the extracellular reaction-diffusion model. Individual bacterial agents chose a PA14 metabolic model state based on a combination of stochastic rules, and agents sensing local oxygen and NO. Transcriptome-guided MiMICS predictions suggested microscale denitrification and oxidative stress metabolic heterogeneity emerged due to local variability in the NO biofilm microenvironment. MiMICS accurately predicted the biofilm's spatial relationships between denitrification, oxidative stress, and central carbon metabolism. As simulated cells responded to extracellular NO, MiMICS revealed dynamics of cell populations heterogeneously upregulating reactions in the denitrification pathway, which may function to maintain NO levels within non-toxic ranges. We demonstrated that MiMICS is a valuable computational tool to incorporate multiple -omics-guided metabolic models to mechanistically map heterogeneous microbial metabolic states to the biofilm microenvironment.
40632498	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Multimodal zero-shot learning of previously unseen epitranscriptomes from RNA-seq data.	Precise identification of condition-specific epitranscriptomes is of critical importance for investigating the dynamics and versatile functions of RNA modification under various biological contexts. Existing approaches for predicting condition-specific RNA modification are usually trained on epitranscriptome data obtained from the same condition, which limited their usage, as such data are available only for a small number of conditions due to the technical difficulties and high expenses of epitranscriptome profiling technologies. We present ExpressRM, a multimodal zero-shot learning framework for predicting condition-specific RNA modification sites in previously unseen contexts from genome and RNA-seq data. Different from existing in-condition learning approaches, this method does not rely on matched epitranscriptome data for training, which greatly expands its applicability. On a benchmark dataset comprising epitranscriptomes and matched transcriptomes of 37 human tissues, we demonstrate that ExpressRM can accurately predict epitranscriptomes of previously unseen conditions from their transcriptomes only, and the performance is comparable to existing in-condition learning algorithms that require epitranscriptome data from the same condition. Additionally, the method has the capability of differentiating highly dynamic RNA methylation sites from more static (or house-keeping) ones. With a case study, we show that ExpressRM can uncover N6-methyladenosine RNA methylation sites in glioblastoma using only its RNA-seq data, and unveils novel and previously validated pathological insights. Together, these results suggest that the proposed multimodal zero-shot learning framework can effectively leverage transcriptome knowledge to explore the dynamic roles of RNA modifications in previously unseen experimental setups, providing valuable insights into vast biological contexts where RNA-seq is routinely used but epitranscriptome profiling has not yet been covered.
39315707	2025	Nucleic acids research	scMMO-atlas: a single cell multimodal omics atlas and portal for exploring fine cell heterogeneity and cell dynamics.	Single-cell multimodal sequencing parallelly captures multiple modalities of the same cell, providing unparalleled insights into cell heterogeneity and cell dynamics. For example, joint profiling of chromatin accessibility and transcriptome from the same single cell (scATAC + RNA) identified new cell subsets within the well-defined clusters. However, lack of single-cell multimodal omics (scMMO) database has led to data fragmentation, seriously hindering access, utilization and mining of scMMO data. Here, we constructed a scMMO atlas by collecting and integrating various scMMO data, then constructed scMMO database and portal called scMMO-atlas (https://www.biosino.org/scMMO-atlas/). scMMO-atlas includes scATAC + RNA (ISSAAS-seq, SNARE-seq, paired-seq, sci-CAR, scCARE-seq, 10X Multiome and so on), scRNA + protein, scATAC + protein and scTri-modal omics data, with 3 168 824 cells from 27 cell tissues/organs. scMMO-atlas offered an interactive portal for visualization and featured analysis for each modality and the integrated data. Integrated analysis of scATAC + RNA data of mouse cerebral cortex in scMMO-atlas identified more cell subsets compared with unimodal omics data. Among these new cell subsets, there is an early astrocyte subset highly expressed Grm3, called Astro-Grm3. Furthermore, we identified Ex-L6-Tle4-Nrf1, a progenitor of Ex-L6-Tle4, indicating the statistical power provided by the big data in scMMO-atlas. In summary, scMMO-atlas offers cell atlas, database and portal to facilitate data utilization and biological insight.
39344710	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	HIP: a method for high-dimensional multi-view data integration and prediction accounting for subgroup heterogeneity.	Epidemiologic and genetic studies in many complex diseases suggest subgroup disparities (e.g. by sex, race) in disease course and patient outcomes. We consider this from the standpoint of integrative analysis where we combine information from different views (e.g. genomics, proteomics, clinical data). Existing integrative analysis methods ignore the heterogeneity in subgroups, and stacking the views and accounting for subgroup heterogeneity does not model the association among the views. We propose Heterogeneity in Integration and Prediction (HIP), a statistical approach for joint association and prediction that leverages the strengths in each view to identify molecular signatures that are shared by and specific to a subgroup. We apply HIP to proteomics and gene expression data pertaining to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to identify proteins and genes shared by, and unique to, males and females, contributing to the variation in COPD, measured by airway wall thickness. Our COPD findings have identified proteins, genes, and pathways that are common across and specific to males and females, some implicated in COPD, while others could lead to new insights into sex differences in COPD mechanisms. HIP accounts for subgroup heterogeneity in multi-view data, ranks variables based on importance, is applicable to univariate or multivariate continuous outcomes, and incorporates covariate adjustment. With the efficient algorithms implemented using PyTorch, this method has many potential scientific applications and could enhance multiomics research in health disparities. HIP is available at https://github.com/lasandrall/HIP, a video tutorial at https://youtu.be/O6E2OLmeMDo and a Shiny Application at https://multi-viewlearn.shinyapps.io/HIP_ShinyApp/ for users with limited programming experience.
40481362	2025	Nature methods	SpotSweeper: spatially aware quality control for spatial transcriptomics.	Quality control (QC) is a crucial step to ensure the reliability of data obtained from RNA sequencing experiments, including spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT). Existing QC approaches for SRT that have been adopted from single-cell or single-nucleus RNA sequencing methods are confounded by spatial biology and are inappropriate for SRT data. In addition, no methods currently exist for identifying histological tissue artifacts that are unique to SRT. Here, we introduce SpotSweeper, a spatially aware QC method that leverages local neighborhoods to correct for spatial confounding in order to identify both local outliers and regional artifacts in SRT. Using SpotSweeper on publicly available data, we identify a consistent set of Visium barcoded spots as systematically low quality and demonstrate that SpotSweeper accurately identifies two distinct types of regional artifacts. SpotSweeper represents a substantial advancement in spatially resolved transcriptomics QC for SRT, providing a robust, generalizable framework to ensure data reliability across diverse experimental conditions and technologies.
41330425	2025	Nucleic acids research	m6AConquer: a consistently quantified and orthogonally validated database for the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) epitranscriptome.	The proper placement of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) on mRNA is essential for normal cell function, and its disruption is linked to numerous human diseases. The rapid growth of m6A data from diverse sequencing technologies presents challenges for integrative analysis due to technique-specific biases and inconsistent processing. While existing databases provide valuable catalogs, their reliance on aggregating pre-processed results can propagate inconsistencies. To overcome these limitations, we present m6AConquer, a database founded on reproducible quantification. We systematically re-processed raw data from 10 distinct profiling methods, including high-resolution GLORI and eTAM-seq, quantifying methylation at millions of consensus sites across human and mouse. Our rigorous pipeline features uniform site-calling and false-positive calibration with in vitro transcribed (IVT) controls where available. By leveraging a reproducibility-based framework across technically orthogonal methods, we identified over 135300 orthogonally validated m6A sites in human (IDR < 0.05). Beyond this validated methylome, m6AConquer provides matched multi-omics data (gene expression, splicing, variants) and identifies m6A quantitative trait loci (m6A QTLs) to link RNA modification to genetic regulation and disease. Offering intuitive query tools, interactive visualizations, and downloadable, analysis-ready data matrices, m6AConquer provides a standardized resource for rigorous exploration of the roles of m6A in biology and medicine, freely accessible at https://rnamd.org/m6aconquer/.
38867699	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	MCDHGN: heterogeneous network-based cancer driver gene prediction and interpretability analysis.	MOTIVATION: Accurately predicting the driver genes of cancer is of great significance for carcinogenesis progress research and cancer treatment. In recent years, more and more deep-learning-based methods have been used for predicting cancer driver genes. However, deep-learning algorithms often have black box properties and cannot interpret the output results. Here, we propose a novel cancer driver gene mining method based on heterogeneous network meta-paths (MCDHGN), which uses meta-path aggregation to enhance the interpretability of predictions. RESULTS: MCDHGN constructs a heterogeneous network by using several types of multi-omics data that are biologically linked to genes. And the differential probabilities of SNV, DNA methylation, and gene expression data between cancerous tissues and normal tissues are extracted as initial features of genes. Nine meta-paths are manually selected, and the representation vectors obtained by aggregating information within and across meta-path nodes are used as new features for subsequent classification and prediction tasks. By comparing with eight homogeneous and heterogeneous network models on two pan-cancer datasets, MCDHGN has better performance on AUC and AUPR values. Additionally, MCDHGN provides interpretability of predicted cancer driver genes through the varying weights of biologically meaningful meta-paths. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: https://github.com/1160300611/MCDHGN.
38566187	2024	Genome biology	Bento: a toolkit for subcellular analysis of spatial transcriptomics data.	The spatial organization of molecules in a cell is essential for their functions. While current methods focus on discerning tissue architecture, cell-cell interactions, and spatial expression patterns, they are limited to the multicellular scale. We present Bento, a Python toolkit that takes advantage of single-molecule information to enable spatial analysis at the subcellular scale. Bento ingests molecular coordinates and segmentation boundaries to perform three analyses: defining subcellular domains, annotating localization patterns, and quantifying gene-gene colocalization. We demonstrate MERFISH, seqFISH + , Molecular Cartography, and Xenium datasets. Bento is part of the open-source Scverse ecosystem, enabling integration with other single-cell analysis tools.
39418180	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	PhenoMultiOmics: an enzymatic reaction inferred multi-omics network visualization web server.	MOTIVATION: Enzymatic reaction play a pivotal role in regulating cellular processes with a high degree of specificity to biological functions. When enzymatic reactions are disrupted by gene, protein, or metabolite dysfunctions in diseases, it becomes crucial to visualize the resulting perturbed enzymatic reaction-induced multi-omics network. Multi-omics network visualization aids in gaining a comprehensive understanding of the functionality and regulatory mechanisms within biological systems. RESULTS: In this study, we designed PhenoMultiOmics, an enzymatic reaction-based multi-omics web server designed to explore the scope of the multi-omics network across various cancer types. We first curated the PhenoMultiOmics database, which enables the retrieval of cancer-gene-protein-metabolite relationships based on the enzymatic reactions. We then developed the MultiOmics network visualization module to depict the interplay between genes, proteins, and metabolites in response to specific cancer-related enzymatic reactions. The biomarker discovery module facilitates functional analysis through differential omic feature expression and pathway enrichment analysis. PhenoMultiOmics has been applied to analyze the transcriptomics data of gastric cancer and the metabolomics data of lung cancer, providing mechanistic insights into interrupted enzymatic reactions and the associated multi-omics network. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: PhenoMultiOmics is freely accessed at https://phenomultiomics.shinyapps.io/cancer/ with a user-friendly and interactive web interface.
34115745	2021	PLoS computational biology	Efficient representations of tumor diversity with paired DNA-RNA aberrations.	"Cancer cells display massive dysregulation of key regulatory pathways due to now well-catalogued mutations and other DNA-related aberrations. Moreover, enormous heterogeneity has been commonly observed in the identity, frequency and location of these aberrations across individuals with the same cancer type or subtype, and this variation naturally propagates to the transcriptome, resulting in myriad types of dysregulated gene expression programs. Many have argued that a more integrative and quantitative analysis of heterogeneity of DNA and RNA molecular profiles may be necessary for designing more systematic explorations of alternative therapies and improving predictive accuracy. We introduce a representation of multi-omics profiles which is sufficiently rich to account for observed heterogeneity and support the construction of quantitative, integrated, metrics of variation. Starting from the network of interactions existing in Reactome, we build a library of ""paired DNA-RNA aberrations"" that represent prototypical and recurrent patterns of dysregulation in cancer; each two-gene ""Source-Target Pair"" (STP) consists of a ""source"" regulatory gene and a ""target"" gene whose expression is plausibly ""controlled"" by the source gene. The STP is then ""aberrant"" in a joint DNA-RNA profile if the source gene is DNA-aberrant (e.g., mutated, deleted, or duplicated), and the downstream target gene is ""RNA-aberrant"", meaning its expression level is outside the normal, baseline range. With M STPs, each sample profile has exactly one of the 2M possible configurations. We concentrate on subsets of STPs, and the corresponding reduced configurations, by selecting tissue-dependent minimal coverings, defined as the smallest family of STPs with the property that every sample in the considered population displays at least one aberrant STP within that family. These minimal coverings can be computed with integer programming. Given such a covering, a natural measure of cross-sample diversity is the extent to which the particular aberrant STPs composing a covering vary from sample to sample; this variability is captured by the entropy of the distribution over configurations. We apply this program to data from TCGA for six distinct tumor types (breast, prostate, lung, colon, liver, and kidney cancer). This enables an efficient simplification of the complex landscape observed in cancer populations, resulting in the identification of novel signatures of molecular alterations which are not detected with frequency-based criteria. Estimates of cancer heterogeneity across tumor phenotypes reveals a stable pattern: entropy increases with disease severity. This framework is then well-suited to accommodate the expanding complexity of cancer genomes and epigenomes emerging from large consortia projects."
37739405	2024	Nucleic acids research	SCAR: Single-cell and Spatially-resolved Cancer Resources.	Advances in sequencing and imaging technologies offer a unique opportunity to unravel cell heterogeneity and develop new immunotherapy strategies for cancer research. There is an urgent need for a resource that effectively integrates a vast amount of transcriptomic profiling data to comprehensively explore cancer tissue heterogeneity and the tumor microenvironment. In this context, we developed the Single-cell and Spatially-resolved Cancer Resources (SCAR) database, a combined tumor spatial and single-cell transcriptomic platform, which is freely accessible at http://8.142.154.29/SCAR2023 or http://scaratlas.com. SCAR contains spatial transcriptomic data from 21 tumor tissues and single-cell transcriptomic data from 11 301 352 cells encompassing 395 cancer subtypes and covering a wide variety of tissues, organoids, and cell lines. This resource offers diverse functional modules to address key cancer research questions at multiple levels, including the screening of tumor cell types, metabolic features, cell communication and gene expression patterns within the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, SCAR enables the analysis of biomarker expression patterns and cell developmental trajectories. SCAR also provides a comprehensive analysis of multi-dimensional datasets based on 34 state-of-the-art omics techniques, serving as an essential tool for in-depth mining and understanding of cell heterogeneity and spatial location. The implications of this resource extend to both cancer biology research and cancer immunotherapy development.
37953328	2024	Nucleic acids research	STOmicsDB: a comprehensive database for spatial transcriptomics data sharing, analysis and visualization.	Recent technological developments in spatial transcriptomics allow researchers to measure gene expression of cells and their spatial locations at the single-cell level, generating detailed biological insight into biological processes. A comprehensive database could facilitate the sharing of spatial transcriptomic data and streamline the data acquisition process for researchers. Here, we present the Spatial TranscriptOmics DataBase (STOmicsDB), a database that serves as a one-stop hub for spatial transcriptomics. STOmicsDB integrates 218 manually curated datasets representing 17 species. We annotated cell types, identified spatial regions and genes, and performed cell-cell interaction analysis for these datasets. STOmicsDB features a user-friendly interface for the rapid visualization of millions of cells. To further facilitate the reusability and interoperability of spatial transcriptomic data, we developed standards for spatial transcriptomic data archiving and constructed a spatial transcriptomic data archiving system. Additionally, we offer a distinctive capability of customizing dedicated sub-databases in STOmicsDB for researchers, assisting them in visualizing their spatial transcriptomic analyses. We believe that STOmicsDB could contribute to research insights in the spatial transcriptomics field, including data archiving, sharing, visualization and analysis.

36690445	2023	Genome research	Multi-omics analyses demonstrate a critical role for EHMT1 methyltransferase in transcriptional repression during oogenesis.	EHMT1 (also known as GLP) is a multifunctional protein, best known for its role as an H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 methyltransferase through its reportedly obligatory dimerization with EHMT2 (also known as G9A). Here, we investigated the role of EHMT1 in the oocyte in comparison to EHMT2 using oocyte-specific conditional knockout mouse models (Ehmt2 cKO, Ehmt1 cKO, Ehmt1/2 cDKO), with ablation from the early phase of oocyte growth. Loss of EHMT1 in Ehmt1 cKO and Ehmt1/2 cDKO oocytes recapitulated meiotic defects observed in the Ehmt2 cKO; however, there was a significant impairment in oocyte maturation and developmental competence in Ehmt1 cKO and Ehmt1/2 cDKO oocytes beyond that observed in the Ehmt2 cKO. Consequently, loss of EHMT1 in oogenesis results, upon fertilization, in mid-gestation embryonic lethality. To identify H3K9 methylation and other meaningful biological changes in each mutant to explore the molecular functions of EHMT1 and EHMT2, we performed immunofluorescence imaging, multi-omics sequencing, and mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteome analyses in cKO oocytes. Although H3K9me1 was depleted only upon loss of EHMT1, H3K9me2 was decreased, and H3K9me2-enriched domains were eliminated equally upon loss of EHMT1 or EHMT2. Furthermore, there were more significant changes in the transcriptome, DNA methylome, and proteome in Ehmt1/2 cDKO than Ehmt2 cKO oocytes, with transcriptional derepression leading to increased protein abundance and local changes in genic DNA methylation in Ehmt1/2 cDKO oocytes. Together, our findings suggest that EHMT1 contributes to local transcriptional repression in the oocyte, partially independent of EHMT2, and is critical for oogenesis and oocyte developmental competence.
41223185	2025	PLoS computational biology	SpaMWGDA: Identifying spatial domains of spatial transcriptomes using multi-view weighted fusion graph convolutional network and data augmentation.	The rapid development of spatial transcriptomics (ST) has made it possible to effectively integrate gene expression and spatial information of cells and accurately identify spatial domains. A large number of deep learning (DL)-based methods have been proposed to perform spatial domain identification and achieved impressive results. However, these methods have some limitations. First, these methods rely on a fixed similarity metric and cannot fully utilize neighborhood information. Second, they cannot efficiently and adaptively integrate key information when fusing and reconstructing gene expression using purely additive methods. Finally, these methods ignore key nonlinear features and introduce noise during clustering. To address these limitations, we propose a novel DL model SpaMWGDA based on multi-view weighted fused graph convolutional network (GCN) and data augmentation. By modeling spatial information using different similarity metrics, the model is able to successfully capture comprehensive neighborhood information of the spot features. By combining data augmentation and contrastive learning, SpaMWGDA is able to learn key gene expressions. SpaMWGDA uses a multi-view GCN encoder to model the similarities between spatial information and gene features, and uses a view-level attention mechanism for weighted fusion to adaptively learn the dependencies between them and learn the key features of each view. Experimental results not only demonstrate that SpaMWGDA outperforms competing methods in spatial domain identification and trajectory inference but also show the ability of SpaMWGDA to analyse tissue structure and function. The source code for SpaMWGDA is available at https://github.com/nathanyl/SpaMWGDA .
39800876	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Deep learning in integrating spatial transcriptomics with other modalities.	Spatial transcriptomics technologies have been extensively applied in biological research, enabling the study of transcriptome while preserving the spatial context of tissues. Paired with spatial transcriptomics data, platforms often provide histology and (or) chromatin images, which capture cellular morphology and chromatin organization. Additionally, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from matching tissues often accompany spatial data, offering a transcriptome-wide gene expression profile of individual cells. Integrating such additional data from other modalities can effectively enhance spatial transcriptomics data, and, conversely, spatial transcriptomics data can supplement scRNA-seq with spatial information. Moreover, the rapid development of spatial multi-omics technology has spurred the demand for the integration of spatial multi-omics data to present a more detailed molecular landscape within tissues. Numerous deep learning (DL) methods have been developed for integrating spatial transcriptomics with other modalities. However, a comprehensive review of DL approaches for integrating spatial transcriptomics data with other modalities remains absent. In this study, we systematically review the applications of DL in integrating spatial transcriptomics data with other modalities. We first delineate the DL techniques applied in this integration and the key tasks involved. Next, we detail these methods and categorize them based on integrated modality and key task. Furthermore, we summarize the integration strategies of these integration methods. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future directions in integrating spatial transcriptomics with other modalities, aiming to facilitate the development of robust computational methods that more comprehensively exploit multimodal information.
29227469	2018	Nature biotechnology	Integrative single-cell analysis of transcriptional and epigenetic states in the human adult brain.	Detailed characterization of the cell types in the human brain requires scalable experimental approaches to examine multiple aspects of the molecular state of individual cells, as well as computational integration of the data to produce unified cell-state annotations. Here we report improved high-throughput methods for single-nucleus droplet-based sequencing (snDrop-seq) and single-cell transposome hypersensitive site sequencing (scTHS-seq). We used each method to acquire nuclear transcriptomic and DNA accessibility maps for >60,000 single cells from human adult visual cortex, frontal cortex, and cerebellum. Integration of these data revealed regulatory elements and transcription factors that underlie cell-type distinctions, providing a basis for the study of complex processes in the brain, such as genetic programs that coordinate adult remyelination. We also mapped disease-associated risk variants to specific cellular populations, which provided insights into normal and pathogenic cellular processes in the human brain. This integrative multi-omics approach permits more detailed single-cell interrogation of complex organs and tissues.
32363378	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	Computational methods for the integrative analysis of single-cell data.	Recent advances in single-cell technologies are providing exciting opportunities for dissecting tissue heterogeneity and investigating cell identity, fate and function. This is a pristine, exploding field that is flooding biologists with a new wave of data, each with its own specificities in terms of complexity and information content. The integrative analysis of genomic data, collected at different molecular layers from diverse cell populations, holds promise to address the full-scale complexity of biological systems. However, the combination of different single-cell genomic signals is computationally challenging, as these data are intrinsically heterogeneous for experimental, technical and biological reasons. Here, we describe the computational methods for the integrative analysis of single-cell genomic data, with a focus on the integration of single-cell RNA sequencing datasets and on the joint analysis of multimodal signals from individual cells.
39418177	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	A multi-modality and multi-granularity collaborative learning framework for identifying spatial domains and spatially variable genes.	MOTIVATION: Recent advances in spatial transcriptomics technologies have provided multi-modality data integrating gene expression, spatial context, and histological images. Accurately identifying spatial domains and spatially variable genes is crucial for understanding tissue structures and biological functions. However, effectively combining multi-modality data to identify spatial domains and determining SVGs closely related to these spatial domains remains a challenge. RESULTS: In this study, we propose spatial transcriptomics multi-modality and multi-granularity collaborative learning (spaMMCL). For detecting spatial domains, spaMMCL mitigates the adverse effects of modality bias by masking portions of gene expression data, integrates gene and image features using a shared graph convolutional network, and employs graph self-supervised learning to deal with noise from feature fusion. Simultaneously, based on the identified spatial domains, spaMMCL integrates various strategies to detect potential SVGs at different granularities, enhancing their reliability and biological significance. Experimental results demonstrate that spaMMCL substantially improves the identification of spatial domains and SVGs. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The code and data of spaMMCL are available on Github: Https://github.com/liangxiao-cs/spaMMCL.
37907328	2023	Genome research	Infernape uncovers cell type-specific and spatially resolved alternative polyadenylation in the brain.	Differential polyadenylation sites (PAs) critically regulate gene expression, but their cell type-specific usage and spatial distribution in the brain have not been systematically characterized. Here, we present Infernape, which infers and quantifies PA usage from single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data and show its application in the mouse brain. Infernape uncovers alternative intronic PAs and 3'-UTR lengthening during cortical neurogenesis. Progenitor-neuron comparisons in the excitatory and inhibitory neuron lineages show overlapping PA changes in embryonic brains, suggesting that the neural proliferation-differentiation axis plays a prominent role. In the adult mouse brain, we uncover cell type-specific PAs and visualize such events using spatial transcriptomic data. Over two dozen neurodevelopmental disorder-associated genes such as Csnk2a1 and Mecp2 show differential PAs during brain development. This study presents Infernape to identify PAs from scRNA-seq and spatial data, and highlights the role of alternative PAs in neuronal gene regulation.
41125832	2025	Nature biotechnology	Tissue and cellular spatiotemporal dynamics in colon aging.	Tissue structure and molecular circuitry in the colon can be profoundly impacted by systemic age-related effects but many of the underlying molecular cues remain unclear. Here, we build a cellular and spatial atlas of the colon across three anatomical regions and 11 age groups, encompassing ~1,500 mouse gut tissues profiled by spatial transcriptomics and ~400,000 single nucleus RNA-sequencing profiles. We develop a computational framework, cSplotch, which learns a hierarchical Bayesian model of spatially resolved cellular expression associated with age, tissue region and sex by leveraging histological features to share information across tissue samples and data modalities. Using this model, we identify cellular and molecular gradients along the adult colonic tract and across the main crypt axis and multicellular programs associated with aging in the large intestine. Our multimodal framework for the investigation of cell and tissue organization can aid in the understanding of cellular roles in tissue-level pathology.
38279647	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	SPANN: annotating single-cell resolution spatial transcriptome data with scRNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: The rapid development of spatial transcriptome technologies has enabled researchers to acquire single-cell-level spatial data at an affordable price. However, computational analysis tools, such as annotation tools, tailored for these data are still lacking. Recently, many computational frameworks have emerged to integrate single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics datasets. While some frameworks can utilize well-annotated scRNA-seq data to annotate spatial expression patterns, they overlook critical aspects. First, existing tools do not explicitly consider cell type mapping when aligning the two modalities. Second, current frameworks lack the capability to detect novel cells, which remains a key interest for biologists. RESULTS: To address these problems, we propose an annotation method for spatial transcriptome data called SPANN. The main tasks of SPANN are to transfer cell-type labels from well-annotated scRNA-seq data to newly generated single-cell resolution spatial transcriptome data and discover novel cells from spatial data. The major innovations of SPANN come from two aspects: SPANN automatically detects novel cells from unseen cell types while maintaining high annotation accuracy over known cell types. SPANN finds a mapping between spatial transcriptome samples and RNA data prototypes and thus conducts cell-type-level alignment. Comprehensive experiments using datasets from various spatial platforms demonstrate SPANN's capabilities in annotating known cell types and discovering novel cell states within complex tissue contexts. AVAILABILITY: The source code of SPANN can be accessed at https://github.com/ddb-qiwang/SPANN-torch. CONTACT: dengmh@math.pku.edu.cn.
33822879	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	DeFusion: a denoised network regularization framework for multi-omics integration.	With diverse types of omics data widely available, many computational methods have been recently developed to integrate these heterogeneous data, providing a comprehensive understanding of diseases and biological mechanisms. But most of them hardly take noise effects into account. Data-specific patterns unique to data types also make it challenging to uncover the consistent patterns and learn a compact representation of multi-omics data. Here we present a multi-omics integration method considering these issues. We explicitly model the error term in data reconstruction and simultaneously consider noise effects and data-specific patterns. We utilize a denoised network regularization in which we build a fused network using a denoising procedure to suppress noise effects and data-specific patterns. The error term collaborates with the denoised network regularization to capture data-specific patterns. We solve the optimization problem via an inexact alternating minimization algorithm. A comparative simulation study shows the method's superiority at discovering common patterns among data types at three noise levels. Transcriptomics-and-epigenomics integration, in seven cancer cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas, demonstrates that the learned integrative representation extracted in an unsupervised manner can depict survival information. Specially in liver hepatocellular carcinoma, the learned integrative representation attains average Harrell's C-index of 0.78 in 10 times 3-fold cross-validation for survival prediction, which far exceeds competing methods, and we discover an aggressive subtype in liver hepatocellular carcinoma with this latent representation, which is validated by an external dataset GSE14520. We also show that DeFusion is applicable to the integration of other omics types.
41222560	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	DSCC: disease subtyping using spectral clustering and community detection from consensus networks.	Molecular subtyping is fundamental in cancer research and clinical management of cancer, guiding treatment planning, monitoring therapeutic response, and informing prognosis. Early methods were designed specifically for gene expression data due to the lack of other molecular data types. Thanks to breakthroughs in high-throughput technologies, recent subtyping tools have shifted their focus to integrating multi-omics profiles to uncover novel subtypes that better reflect genetic variation, molecular pathogenesis, tumor heterogeneity, and host response biological mechanisms. However, these integrative approaches have not been able to fully exploit the complementary potentials of diverse molecular data types. They often rely on specific omics types with large common sample size and fail to incorporate important biological knowledge in their models. Here, we introduce Disease subtyping using Spectral clustering and Community detection from Consensus networks (DSCC), a method designed to identify meaningful disease subtypes from a wide range of molecular data, including gene expression, miRNA expression, DNA methylation, copy number variation, somatic mutations, protein abundance, and metabolite levels. We demonstrate the superiority of DSCC over state-of-the-art cancer subtyping methods using 43 cancer datasets with more than 11,000 patients. Furthermore, the incorporation of DSCC-derived subtype information as a covariate in prognostic models improves survival prediction accuracy and robustness. The DSCC source code, data, and scripts for reproducing all results in this study are available at https://github.com/tinnlab/DSCC.
37216588	2023	Nucleic acids research	SMDB: a Spatial Multimodal Data Browser.	Understanding the relationship between fine-scale spatial organization and biological function necessitates a tool that effectively combines spatial positions, morphological information, and spatial transcriptomics (ST) data. We introduce the Spatial Multimodal Data Browser (SMDB, https://www.biosino.org/smdb), a robust visualization web service for interactively exploring ST data. By integrating multimodal data, such as hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) images, gene expression-based molecular clusters, and more, SMDB facilitates the analysis of tissue composition through the dissociation of two-dimensional (2D) sections and the identification of gene expression-profiled boundaries. In a digital three-dimensional (3D) space, SMDB allows researchers to reconstruct morphology visualizations based on manually filtered spots or expand anatomical structures using high-resolution molecular subtypes. To enhance user experience, it offers customizable workspaces for interactive exploration of ST spots in tissues, providing features like smooth zooming, panning, 360-degree rotation in 3D and adjustable spot scaling. SMDB is particularly valuable in neuroscience and spatial histology studies, as it incorporates Allen's mouse brain anatomy atlas for reference in morphological research. This powerful tool provides a comprehensive and efficient solution for examining the intricate relationships between spatial morphology, and biological function in various tissues.
37735569	2023	Nature methods	Spatiotemporal, optogenetic control of gene expression in organoids.	Organoids derived from stem cells have become an increasingly important tool for studying human development and modeling disease. However, methods are still needed to control and study spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression in organoids. Here we combined optogenetics and gene perturbation technologies to activate or knock-down RNA of target genes in programmable spatiotemporal patterns. To illustrate the usefulness of our approach, we locally activated Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling in an organoid model for human neurodevelopment. Spatial and single-cell transcriptomic analyses showed that this local induction was sufficient to generate stereotypically patterned organoids and revealed new insights into SHH's contribution to gene regulation in neurodevelopment. With this study, we propose optogenetic perturbations in combination with spatial transcriptomics as a powerful technology to reprogram and study cell fates and tissue patterning in organoids.
35904814	2022	Nucleic acids research	TET1 regulates gene expression and repression of endogenous retroviruses independent of DNA demethylation.	DNA methylation (5-methylcytosine (5mC)) is critical for genome stability and transcriptional regulation in mammals. The discovery that ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins catalyze the oxidation of 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC), and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) revolutionized our perspective on the complexity and regulation of DNA modifications. However, to what extent the regulatory functions of TET1 can be attributed to its catalytic activity remains unclear. Here, we use genome engineering and quantitative multi-omics approaches to dissect the precise catalytic vs. non-catalytic functions of TET1 in murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Our study identifies TET1 as an essential interaction hub for multiple chromatin modifying complexes and a global regulator of histone modifications. Strikingly, we find that the majority of transcriptional regulation depends on non-catalytic functions of TET1. In particular, we show that TET1 is critical for the establishment of H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 at endogenous retroviral elements (ERVs) and their silencing that is independent of its canonical role in DNA demethylation. Furthermore, we provide evidence that this repression of ERVs depends on the interaction between TET1 and SIN3A. In summary, we demonstrate that the non-catalytic functions of TET1 are critical for regulation of gene expression and the silencing of endogenous retroviruses in mESCs.
37723583	2023	Genome biology	Disparities in spatially variable gene calling highlight the need for benchmarking spatial transcriptomics methods.	Identifying spatially variable genes (SVGs) is a key step in the analysis of spatially resolved transcriptomics data. SVGs provide biological insights by defining transcriptomic differences within tissues, which was previously unachievable using RNA-sequencing technologies. However, the increasing number of published tools designed to define SVG sets currently lack benchmarking methods to accurately assess performance. This study compares results of 6 purpose-built packages for SVG identification across 9 public and 5 simulated datasets and highlights discrepancies between results. Additional tools for generation of simulated data and development of benchmarking methods are required to improve methods for identifying SVGs.
41068938	2025	Genome biology	Multi-omics insights into microbiome-rumen epithelium interaction mechanisms underlying subacute rumen acidosis tolerance in dairy goats.	BACKGROUND: To address rising demand for dairy products, dairy goats are often fed high-concentrate diets, which lead to subacute rumen acidosis (SARA). The mechanisms behind individual variation in SARA tolerance are not well understood. This study aims to elucidate roles of rumen microbiome-host interactions in SARA-susceptibility and tolerance. RESULTS: Goats susceptible or tolerant to SARA were selected by feeding diets with different levels of rumen degradable starch. SARA-susceptible goats present prolonged periods of rumen pH below 5.8 and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) accumulation. Metagenomic analysis reveals a decrease in cellulose- and hemicellulose-utilizing bacteria and enzymes, along with increased lysozymes, suggesting disrupted rumen homeostasis. Transcriptomic and single-nucleus transcriptome analyses reveal upregulated Th17 cells, IL-17 signalling, and inflammatory pathways in SARA-susceptible goats. In contrast, SARA-tolerant goats maintain stable pH levels and enhance VFAs absorption. Bifidobacterium adolescentis and other beneficial bacteria are enriched in the rumen of SARA-tolerant goats. These microbes are positively correlated with 3-methyl pyruvic acid, a key metabolite involved in branched-chain amino acid synthesis and epithelial cell proliferation. Both microbiome transplantation and B. adolescentis direct feeding experiments confirm the protective effects of SARA-tolerant microbiota including B. adolescentis, promoting rumen epithelial VFAs absorption and reducing ruminal inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the importance of Th17-mediated immune responses in ruminal inflammation and the role of B. adolescentis in regulating rumen epithelial VFAs absorption. Modulating VFAs absorption in the rumen epithelium represents a promising strategy for improving animal health and enhancing rumen fermentation efficiency.
40698867	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Path-MGCN: a pathway activity-based multi-view graph convolutional network for determining spatial domains.	Spatial transcriptomics (ST) comprehensively measure the gene expression profiles while preserving the spatial information. Accumulated computational frameworks have been proposed to identify spatial domains, one of the fundamental tasks of ST data analysis, to understand the tissue architecture. However, current methods often overlook pathway-level functional context and struggle with data sparsity. Therefore, we develop Path-MGCN, a multi-view graph convolutional network (GCN) with attention mechanism, which integrates pathway information. We first calculate spot-level pathway activity scores via gene set variation analysis from gene expression and construct distinct adjacency graphs representing spatial and functional proximity. A multi-view GCN learns spatial, pathway, and shared embeddings adaptively fused by attention and followed by a Zero-inflated negative binomial decoder to retain the original transcriptome information. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse datasets (human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, breast cancer and mouse brain) at various resolution demonstrate Path-MGCN's superior accuracy and robustness, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods and maintaining high performance across different pathway databases (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, Gene Ontology, Reactome). Crucially, Path-MGCN enhances biological interpretability, enabling the identification of Tertiary lymphoid structure-like regions and spatially resolved metabolic heterogeneity (hypoxia, glycolysis, AMP-activated protein kinase signaling) linked to tumor progression stages in human breast cancer. By effectively integrating functional context, Path-MGCN advances ST analysis, providing an accurate and interpretable framework to dissect tissue heterogeneity and enables detailed spatial mapping of molecular pathways that highlights potential targeted therapeutic strategies crucial for developing safe and effective synergistic anti-tumor therapies.
37351575	2023	Nucleic acids research	Spatially resolved transcriptomic analysis of the germinating barley grain.	Seeds are a vital source of calories for humans and a unique stage in the life cycle of flowering plants. During seed germination, the embryo undergoes major developmental transitions to become a seedling. Studying gene expression in individual seed cell types has been challenging due to the lack of spatial information or low throughput of existing methods. To overcome these limitations, a spatial transcriptomics workflow was developed for germinating barley grain. This approach enabled high-throughput analysis of spatial gene expression, revealing specific spatial expression patterns of various functional gene categories at a sub-tissue level. This study revealed over 14 000 genes differentially regulated during the first 24 h after imbibition. Individual genes, such as the aquaporin gene family, starch degradation, cell wall modification, transport processes, ribosomal proteins and transcription factors, were found to have specific spatial expression patterns over time. Using spatial autocorrelation algorithms, we identified auxin transport genes that had increasingly focused expression within subdomains of the embryo over time, suggesting their role in establishing the embryo axis. Overall, our study provides an unprecedented spatially resolved cellular map for barley germination and identifies specific functional genomics targets to better understand cellular restricted processes during germination. The data can be viewed at https://spatial.latrobe.edu.au/.
34953465	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	An integrated brain-specific network identifies genes associated with neuropathologic and clinical traits of Alzheimer's disease.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) has a strong genetic predisposition. However, its risk genes remain incompletely identified. We developed an Alzheimer's brain gene network-based approach to predict AD-associated genes by leveraging the functional pattern of known AD-associated genes. Our constructed network outperformed existing networks in predicting AD genes. We then systematically validated the predictions using independent genetic, transcriptomic, proteomic data, neuropathological and clinical data. First, top-ranked genes were enriched in AD-associated pathways. Second, using external gene expression data from the Mount Sinai Brain Bank study, we found that the top-ranked genes were significantly associated with neuropathological and clinical traits, including the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease score, Braak stage score and clinical dementia rating. The analysis of Alzheimer's brain single-cell RNA-seq data revealed cell-type-specific association of predicted genes with early pathology of AD. Third, by interrogating proteomic data in the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project and Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging studies, we observed a significant association of protein expression level with cognitive function and AD clinical severity. The network, method and predictions could become a valuable resource to advance the identification of risk genes for AD.
40569046	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	HECLIP: histology-enhanced contrastive learning for imputation of transcriptomics profiles.	MOTIVATION: Histopathology, particularly hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, is pivotal for diagnosing and characterizing pathological conditions by visualizing tissue morphology. However, H&E-stained images inherently lack molecular resolution, necessitating costly and labor-intensive technologies like spatial transcriptomics (ST) to uncover spatial gene expression patterns. There is a critical need for scalable computational methods that can bridge this imaging-transcriptomics gap. RESULTS: We present histology-enhanced contrastive learning for imputation of profiles (HECLIP), an innovative deep learning framework designed to infer spatial gene expression profiles directly from H&E-stained histology images. HECLIP employs an image-centric contrastive learning strategy to capture morphological features relevant to molecular expression. By minimizing dependence on ST data, HECLIP enables accurate and biologically meaningful predictions of gene expression. Extensive benchmarking on publicly available datasets demonstrates that HECLIP outperforms existing methods. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each model component to its overall performance. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code for HECLIP is freely available at: https://github.com/QSong-github/HECLIP.
39207729	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	CHAI: consensus clustering through similarity matrix integration for cell-type identification.	Several methods have been developed to computationally predict cell-types for single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data. As methods are developed, a common problem for investigators has been identifying the best method they should apply to their specific use-case. To address this challenge, we present CHAI (consensus Clustering tHrough similArIty matrix integratIon for single cell-type identification), a wisdom of crowds approach for scRNAseq clustering. CHAI presents two competing methods which aggregate the clustering results from seven state-of-the-art clustering methods: CHAI-AvgSim and CHAI-SNF. CHAI-AvgSim and CHAI-SNF demonstrate superior performance across several benchmarking datasets. Furthermore, both CHAI methods outperform the most recent consensus clustering method, SAME-clustering. We demonstrate CHAI's practical use case by identifying a leader tumor cell cluster enriched with CDH3. CHAI provides a platform for multiomic integration, and we demonstrate CHAI-SNF to have improved performance when including spatial transcriptomics data. CHAI overcomes previous limitations by incorporating the most recent and top performing scRNAseq clustering algorithms into the aggregation framework. It is also an intuitive and easily customizable R package where users may add their own clustering methods to the pipeline, or down-select just the ones they want to use for the clustering aggregation. This ensures that as more advanced clustering algorithms are developed, CHAI will remain useful to the community as a generalized framework. CHAI is available as an open source R package on GitHub: https://github.com/lodimk2/chai.
39985444	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	AsaruSim: a single-cell and spatial RNA-Seq Nanopore long-reads simulation workflow.	MOTIVATION: The combination of long-read sequencing technologies like Oxford Nanopore with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) assays enables the detailed exploration of transcriptomic complexity, including isoform detection and quantification, by capturing full-length cDNAs. However, challenges remain, including the lack of advanced simulation tools that can effectively mimic the unique complexities of scRNAseq long-read datasets. Such tools are essential for the evaluation and optimization of isoform detection methods dedicated to single-cell long-read studies. RESULTS: We developed AsaruSim, a workflow that simulates synthetic single-cell long-read Nanopore datasets, closely mimicking real experimental data. AsaruSim employs a multi-step process that includes the creation of a synthetic count matrix, generation of perfect reads, optional PCR amplification, introduction of sequencing errors, and comprehensive quality control reporting. Applied to a dataset of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, AsaruSim accurately reproduced experimental read characteristics. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code and full documentation are available at https://github.com/GenomiqueENS/AsaruSim.

37000175	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	SCREE: a comprehensive pipeline for single-cell multi-modal CRISPR screen data processing and analysis.	Single-cell CRISPR screens have been widely used to investigate gene regulatory circuits in diverse biological systems. The recent development of single-cell CRISPR screens has enabled multimodal profiling of perturbed cells with both gene expression, chromatin accessibility and protein levels. However, current methods cannot meet the analysis requirements of different types of data and have limited functions. Here, we introduce Single-cell CRISPR screens data analysEs and perturbation modEling (SCREE) as a comprehensive and flexible pipeline to facilitate the analyses of various types of single-cell CRISPR screens data. SCREE performs read alignment, sgRNA assignment, quality control, clustering and visualization, perturbation enrichment evaluation, perturbation efficiency modeling, gene regulatory score calculation and functional analyses of perturbations for single-cell CRISPR screens with both RNA, ATAC and multimodal readout. SCREE is available at https://github.com/wanglabtongji/SCREE.
35337374	2022	Genome biology	Statistical and machine learning methods for spatially resolved transcriptomics data analysis.	The recent advancement in spatial transcriptomics technology has enabled multiplexed profiling of cellular transcriptomes and spatial locations. As the capacity and efficiency of the experimental technologies continue to improve, there is an emerging need for the development of analytical approaches. Furthermore, with the continuous evolution of sequencing protocols, the underlying assumptions of current analytical methods need to be re-evaluated and adjusted to harness the increasing data complexity. To motivate and aid future model development, we herein review the recent development of statistical and machine learning methods in spatial transcriptomics, summarize useful resources, and highlight the challenges and opportunities ahead.
41237053	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Spider: a flexible and unified framework for simulating spatial transcriptomics data.	"MOTIVATION: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies provide valuable insights into cellular heterogeneity by simultaneously acquiring both gene expression profiles and cellular location information. However, the limited diversity and accuracy of ""gold standard"" datasets hindered the effectiveness and fairness of benchmarking rapidly growing ST analysis tools. RESULTS: To address this issue, we proposed Spider, a flexible and comprehensive framework for simulating ST data without requiring real ST data as a reference. By characterizing the spatial patterns using cell type proportion and transition matrix between adjacent cells, Spider can produce more realistic and diverse simulated data and offer enhanced modeling flexibility compared to existing simulation methods. Additionally, Spider provides interactive features for customizing the spatial domain, such as zone segmentation and integration of histology imaging data. Benchmark analyses demonstrate that Spider outperforms other simulation tools in preserving the spatial characteristics of real ST data and facilitating the evaluation of downstream analysis methods. Spider is implemented in Python and available at https://github.com/YANG-ERA/Spider. AVAILABILITY: All codes, simulated ST data in this paper are publicly available at https://github.com/YANG-ERA/Spider. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online."
33855351	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	Multilevel prioritization of gene regulators associated with consensus molecular subtypes of colorectal cancer.	Consensus molecular subtypes (CMSs) are emerging as critical factor for prognosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. Gene regulators, including chromatin regulator, RNA-binding protein and transcriptional factor, are critical modulators of cancer hallmark, yet little is known regarding the underlying functional mechanism in CMSs. Herein, we identified a core set of 235 functional gene regulators (FGRs) by integrating genome, epigenome, transcriptome and interactome of CMSs. FGRs exhibited significant multi-omics alterations and impacts on cell lines growth, as well as significantly enriched cancer driver genes and pathways. Moreover, common FGRs played different roles in the context of CMSs. In accordance with the immune characteristics of CMSs, we found that the anti-tumor immune pathways were mainly activated by FGRs (e.g. STAT1 and CREBBP) in CMS1, while inhibited by FGRs in CMS2-4. FGRs mediated aberrant expression of ligands, which bind to receptor on immune cells, and modulated tumor immune microenvironment of subtypes. Intriguingly, systematic exploration of datasets using genomic and transcriptome co-similarity reveals the coordinated manner in FGRs act in CMSs to orchestrate their pathways and patients' prognosis. Expression signatures of the FGRs revealed an optimized CMS classifier, which demonstrated 88% concordance with the gold-standard classifier, but avoiding the influence of sample composition. Overall, our integrative analysis identified FGRs to regulate core tumorigenic processes/pathways across CMSs.
38796691	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Benchmarking mapping algorithms for cell-type annotating in mouse brain by integrating single-nucleus RNA-seq and Stereo-seq data.	Limited gene capture efficiency and spot size of spatial transcriptome (ST) data pose significant challenges in cell-type characterization. The heterogeneity and complexity of cell composition in the mammalian brain make it more challenging to accurately annotate ST data from brain. Many algorithms attempt to characterize subtypes of neuron by integrating ST data with single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) or single-cell RNA sequencing. However, assessing the accuracy of these algorithms on Stereo-seq ST data remains unresolved. Here, we benchmarked 9 mapping algorithms using 10 ST datasets from four mouse brain regions in two different resolutions and 24 pseudo-ST datasets from snRNA-seq. Both actual ST data and pseudo-ST data were mapped using snRNA-seq datasets from the corresponding brain regions as reference data. After comparing the performance across different areas and resolutions of the mouse brain, we have reached the conclusion that both robust cell-type decomposition and SpatialDWLS demonstrated superior robustness and accuracy in cell-type annotation. Testing with publicly available snRNA-seq data from another sequencing platform in the cortex region further validated our conclusions. Altogether, we developed a workflow for assessing suitability of mapping algorithm that fits for ST datasets, which can improve the efficiency and accuracy of spatial data annotation.
35380686	2022	Nucleic acids research	Nonmodular oscillator and switch based on RNA decay drive regeneration of multimodal gene expression.	Periodic gene expression dynamics are key to cell and organism physiology. Studies of oscillatory expression have focused on networks with intuitive regulatory negative feedback loops, leaving unknown whether other common biochemical reactions can produce oscillations. Oscillation and noise have been proposed to support mammalian progenitor cells' capacity to restore heterogenous, multimodal expression from extreme subpopulations, but underlying networks and specific roles of noise remained elusive. We use mass-action-based models to show that regulated RNA degradation involving as few as two RNA species-applicable to nearly half of human protein-coding genes-can generate sustained oscillations without explicit feedback. Diverging oscillation periods synergize with noise to robustly restore cell populations' bimodal expression on timescales of days. The global bifurcation organizing this divergence relies on an oscillator and bistable switch which cannot be decomposed into two structural modules. Our work reveals surprisingly rich dynamics of post-transcriptional reactions and a potentially widespread mechanism underlying development, tissue regeneration, and cancer cell heterogeneity.
40072848	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Cancer gene identification through integrating causal prompting large language model with omics data-driven causal inference.	Identifying genes causally linked to cancer from a multi-omics perspective is essential for understanding the mechanisms of cancer and improving therapeutic strategies. Traditional statistical and machine-learning methods that rely on generalized correlation approaches to identify cancer genes often produce redundant, biased predictions with limited interpretability, largely due to overlooking confounding factors, selection biases, and the nonlinear activation function in neural networks. In this study, we introduce a novel framework for identifying cancer genes across multiple omics domains, named ICGI (Integrative Causal Gene Identification), which leverages a large language model (LLM) prompted with causality contextual cues and prompts, in conjunction with data-driven causal feature selection. This approach demonstrates the effectiveness and potential of LLMs in uncovering cancer genes and comprehending disease mechanisms, particularly at the genomic level. However, our findings also highlight that current LLMs may not capture comprehensive information across all omics levels. By applying the proposed causal feature selection module to transcriptomic datasets from six cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas and comparing its performance with state-of-the-art methods, it demonstrates superior capability in identifying cancer genes that distinguish between cancerous and normal samples. Additionally, we have developed an online service platform that allows users to input a gene of interest and a specific cancer type. The platform provides automated results indicating whether the gene plays a significant role in cancer, along with clear and accessible explanations. Moreover, the platform summarizes the inference outcomes obtained from data-driven causal learning methods.
34849574	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	SC-MEB: spatial clustering with hidden Markov random field using empirical Bayes.	Spatial transcriptomics has been emerging as a powerful technique for resolving gene expression profiles while retaining tissue spatial information. These spatially resolved transcriptomics make it feasible to examine the complex multicellular systems of different microenvironments. To answer scientific questions with spatial transcriptomics and expand our understanding of how cell types and states are regulated by microenvironment, the first step is to identify cell clusters by integrating the available spatial information. Here, we introduce SC-MEB, an empirical Bayes approach for spatial clustering analysis using a hidden Markov random field. We have also derived an efficient expectation-maximization algorithm based on an iterative conditional mode for SC-MEB. In contrast to BayesSpace, a recently developed method, SC-MEB is not only computationally efficient and scalable to large sample sizes but is also capable of choosing the smoothness parameter and the number of clusters. We performed comprehensive simulation studies to demonstrate the superiority of SC-MEB over some existing methods. We applied SC-MEB to analyze the spatial transcriptome of human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissues and mouse hypothalamic preoptic region. Our analysis results showed that SC-MEB can achieve a similar or better clustering performance to BayesSpace, which uses the true number of clusters and a fixed smoothness parameter. Moreover, SC-MEB is scalable to large 'sample sizes'. We then employed SC-MEB to analyze a colon dataset from a patient with colorectal cancer (CRC) and COVID-19, and further performed differential expression analysis to identify signature genes related to the clustering results. The heatmap of identified signature genes showed that the clusters identified using SC-MEB were more separable than those obtained with BayesSpace. Using pathway analysis, we identified three immune-related clusters, and in a further comparison, found the mean expression of COVID-19 signature genes was greater in immune than non-immune regions of colon tissue. SC-MEB provides a valuable computational tool for investigating the structural organizations of tissues from spatial transcriptomic data.
40682180	2025	Genome biology	Epigenetic priming of mammalian embryonic enhancer elements coordinates developmental gene networks.	BACKGROUND: Embryonic development requires the accurate spatiotemporal execution of cell lineage-specific gene expression programs, which are controlled by transcriptional enhancers. Developmental enhancers adopt a primed chromatin state prior to their activation. How this primed enhancer state is established and maintained and how it affects the regulation of developmental gene networks remains poorly understood. RESULTS: Here, we use comparative multi-omic analyses of human and mouse early embryonic development to identify subsets of postgastrulation lineage-specific enhancers which are epigenetically primed ahead of their activation, marked by the histone modification H3K4me1 within the epiblast. We show that epigenetic priming occurs at lineage-specific enhancers for all three germ layers and that epigenetic priming of enhancers confers lineage-specific regulation of key developmental gene networks. Surprisingly in some cases, lineage-specific enhancers are epigenetically marked already in the zygote, weeks before their activation during lineage specification. Moreover, we outline a generalizable strategy to use naturally occurring human genetic variation to delineate important sequence determinants of primed enhancer function. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings identify an evolutionarily conserved program of enhancer priming and begin to dissect the temporal dynamics and mechanisms of its establishment and maintenance during early mammalian development.
41160498	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Joint Representation Learning for Oncology Applications.	MOTIVATION: The integration of tumour imaging data and molecular sequencing information can advance our understanding of cancer biology by combining complementary perspectives of tumor phenotype and genotype. However, integrating multi-modal data across heterogeneous and high-dimensional data domains remains a significant computational challenge. RESULTS: Here, we introduce an unsupervised manifold alignment approach for real-world data integration based on Joint Multidimensional Scaling (Joint MDS) and extend it to a three-modality framework (Joint MDS3). We apply this method to integrate radiomic features from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with transcriptomic, epigenomic, and copy number variation (CNV) data from patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and lower-grade gliomas (LGG). Compared to baselines such as Pamona and single-cell optimal transport (SCOTv2), Joint MDS consistently outperforms baseline Pamona in cases and achieves competitive performance relative to baseline SCOTv2, outperforming its fraction of samples closer to an incorrect match (FOSCTTM) in four out of six cases. Joint MDS attains an average label transfer accuracy of 74.8%, approximately 4% higher than that of Pamona and SCOTv2, and reduces FOSCTTM to 51% or less across real-world datasets. We further demonstrate our extension JointMDS3 on both synthetic and real-world examples. Our results highlight the potential of Joint MDS to enhance the integration of diverse data types into a unified representation, ultimately advancing computational approaches in complex diseases. AVAILABILITY: The implementation of our work is available at gitlab.ethz.ch/BMDSlab/publications/oncology/joint-representation-learning-for-oncology-applications and archived at doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17219404. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
36064614	2022	Genome biology	Integrating temporal single-cell gene expression modalities for trajectory inference and disease prediction.	BACKGROUND: Current methods for analyzing single-cell datasets have relied primarily on static gene expression measurements to characterize the molecular state of individual cells. However, capturing temporal changes in cell state is crucial for the interpretation of dynamic phenotypes such as the cell cycle, development, or disease progression. RNA velocity infers the direction and speed of transcriptional changes in individual cells, yet it is unclear how these temporal gene expression modalities may be leveraged for predictive modeling of cellular dynamics. RESULTS: Here, we present the first task-oriented benchmarking study that investigates integration of temporal sequencing modalities for dynamic cell state prediction. We benchmark ten integration approaches on ten datasets spanning different biological contexts, sequencing technologies, and species. We find that integrated data more accurately infers biological trajectories and achieves increased performance on classifying cells according to perturbation and disease states. Furthermore, we show that simple concatenation of spliced and unspliced molecules performs consistently well on classification tasks and can be used over more memory intensive and computationally expensive methods. CONCLUSIONS: This work illustrates how integrated temporal gene expression modalities may be leveraged for predicting cellular trajectories and sample-associated perturbation and disease phenotypes. Additionally, this study provides users with practical recommendations for task-specific integration of single-cell gene expression modalities.
35762154	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	Multi-omics to characterize the functional relationships of R-loops with epigenetic modifications, RNAPII transcription and gene expression.	Abnormal accumulation of R-loops results in replication stress, genome instability, chromatin alterations and gene silencing. Little research has been done to characterize functional relationships among R-loops, histone marks, RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription and gene regulation. We built extremely randomized trees (ETs) models to predict the genome-wide R-loops using RNAPII and multiple histone modifications chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq, DNase-seq, Global Run-On sequencing (GRO-seq) and R-loop profiling data. We compared the performance of ET models to multiple machine learning approaches, and the proposed ET models achieved the best and extremely robust performances. Epigenetic profiles are highly predictive of R-loops genome-widely and they are strongly associated with R-loop formation. In addition, the presence of R-loops is significantly correlated with RNAPII transcription activity, H3K4me3 and open chromatin around the transcription start site, and H3K9me1 and H3K9me3 around the transcription termination site. RNAPII pausing defects were correlated with 5'R-loops accumulation, and transcriptional termination defects and read-throughs were correlated with 3'R-loops accumulation. Furthermore, we found driver genes with 5'R-loops and RNAPII pausing defects express significantly higher and genes with 3'R-loops and read-through transcription express significantly lower than genes without R-loops. These driver genes are enriched with chromosomal instability, Hippo-Merlin signaling Dysregulation, DNA damage response and TGF-beta pathways, indicating R-loops accumulating at the 5' end of genes play oncogenic roles, whereas at the 3' end of genes play tumor-suppressive roles in tumorigenesis.
37917660	2023	PLoS computational biology	A Bayesian method to infer copy number clones from single-cell RNA and ATAC sequencing.	Single-cell RNA and ATAC sequencing technologies enable the examination of gene expression and chromatin accessibility in individual cells, providing insights into cellular phenotypes. In cancer research, it is important to consistently analyze these states within an evolutionary context on genetic clones. Here we present CONGAS+, a Bayesian model to map single-cell RNA and ATAC profiles onto the latent space of copy number clones. CONGAS+ clusters cells into tumour subclones with similar ploidy, rendering straightforward to compare their expression and chromatin profiles. The framework, implemented on GPU and tested on real and simulated data, scales to analyse seamlessly thousands of cells, demonstrating better performance than single-molecule models, and supporting new multi-omics assays. In prostate cancer, lymphoma and basal cell carcinoma, CONGAS+ successfully identifies complex subclonal architectures while providing a coherent mapping between ATAC and RNA, facilitating the study of genotype-phenotype maps and their connection to genomic instability.
40764053	2025	Genome research	High-resolution spatial transcriptomics in fixed tissue using a cost-effective PCL-seq workflow.	The spatial heterogeneity of gene expression has driven the development of diverse spatial transcriptomics technologies. Here, we present photocleavage and ligation sequencing (PCL-seq), a spatial indexing method utilizing a light-controlled DNA labeling strategy applied to tissue sections. PCL-seq employs photocleavable oligonucleotides and ligation adapters to construct transcriptional profiles of specific regions of interest (ROIs) designated via microscopically controlled photo-illumination. In frozen mouse embryos, PCL-seq generates spatially aligned gene expression matrices and produces high-quality data, detecting approximately 170,000 unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) and 8600 genes (illumination diameter = 100 microm). Moreover, PCL-seq is compatible with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues, successfully identifying thousands of differentially enriched transcripts in the digits and vertebrae of mouse embryo FFPE sections. Additionally, PCL-seq achieves subcellular resolution, as demonstrated by differential expression profiling between nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. These characteristics establish PCL-seq as an accessible and versatile workflow for spatial transcriptomic analyses in both frozen and FFPE tissues with subcellular resolution.
40985765	2025	Nucleic acids research	SPACE: Spatially variable gene clustering adjusting for cell type effect for improved spatial domain detection.	Recent advances in spatial transcriptomics (ST) have significantly deepened our understanding of biology. A primary focus in ST analysis is to identify spatially variable genes (SVGs) which are crucial for downstream tasks like spatial domain detection. Spatial domains reflect underlying tissue architecture and distinct biological processes. Traditional methods often use a set number of top SVGs for this purpose, and embedding these SVGs simultaneously can confound unrelated spatial signals, dilute weaker patterns, leading to obscured latent structure. Instead, grouping SVGs and getting low-dimensional embedding within each group preserves specific patterns, reduces signal mixing, and enhances the detection of diverse structures. Furthermore, classifying SVGs is akin to identifying cell-type marker genes, offering valuable biological insights. The challenge lies in accurately categorizing SVGs into relevant clusters, aggravated by the absence of prior knowledge regarding the number and spatial gene patterns. Here, we propose SPACE, a framework that classifies SVGs based on their spatial patterns by adjusting for shared cell-type confounding effects, to improve spatial domain detection. This method does not require prior knowledge of gene cluster numbers, spatial patterns, or cell type information. Both simulation and real data analyses demonstrate that SPACE is an efficient and promising tool for ST analysis.
36316562	2022	Nature methods	Unsupervised discovery of tissue architecture in multiplexed imaging.	Multiplexed imaging and spatial transcriptomics enable highly resolved spatial characterization of cellular phenotypes, but still largely depend on laborious manual annotation to understand higher-order patterns of tissue organization. As a result, higher-order patterns of tissue organization are poorly understood and not systematically connected to disease pathology or clinical outcomes. To address this gap, we developed an approach called UTAG to identify and quantify microanatomical tissue structures in multiplexed images without human intervention. Our method combines information on cellular phenotypes with the physical proximity of cells to accurately identify organ-specific microanatomical domains in healthy and diseased tissue. We apply our method to various types of images across healthy and disease states to show that it can consistently detect higher-level architectures in human tissues, quantify structural differences between healthy and diseased tissue, and reveal tissue organization patterns at the organ scale.
36138169	2023	Nature biotechnology	Scalable in situ single-cell profiling by electrophoretic capture of mRNA using EEL FISH.	Methods to spatially profile the transcriptome are dominated by a trade-off between resolution and throughput. Here we develop a method named Enhanced ELectric Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (EEL FISH) that can rapidly process large tissue samples without compromising spatial resolution. By electrophoretically transferring RNA from a tissue section onto a capture surface, EEL speeds up data acquisition by reducing the amount of imaging needed, while ensuring that RNA molecules move straight down toward the surface, preserving single-cell resolution. We apply EEL on eight entire sagittal sections of the mouse brain and measure the expression patterns of up to 440 genes to reveal complex tissue organization. Moreover, EEL can be used to study challenging human samples by removing autofluorescent lipofuscin, enabling the spatial transcriptome of the human visual cortex to be visualized. We provide full hardware specifications, all protocols and complete software for instrument control, image processing, data analysis and visualization.
38602320	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	The HLA-I landscape confers prognosis and antitumor immunity in breast cancer.	Breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease with varied subtypes, prognoses and therapeutic responsiveness. Human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) shapes the immunity and thereby influences the outcome of breast cancer. However, the implications of HLA-I variations in breast cancer remain poorly understood. In this study, we established a multiomics cohort of 1156 Chinese breast cancer patients for HLA-I investigation. We calculated four important HLA-I indicators in each individual, including HLA-I expression level, somatic HLA-I loss of heterozygosity (LOH), HLA-I evolutionary divergence (HED) and peptide-binding promiscuity (Pr). Then, we evaluated their distribution and prognostic significance in breast cancer subtypes. We found that the four breast cancer subtypes had distinct features of HLA-I indicators. Increased expression of HLA-I and LOH were enriched in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), while Pr was relatively higher in hot tumors within TNBCs. In particular, a higher Pr indicated a better prognosis in TNBCs by regulating the infiltration of immune cells and the expression of immune molecules. Using the matched genomic and transcriptomic data, we found that mismatch repair deficiency-related mutational signature and pathways were enriched in low-Pr TNBCs, suggesting that targeting mismatch repair deficiency for synthetic lethality might be promising therapy for these patients. In conclusion, we presented an overview of HLA-I indicators in breast cancer and provided hints for precision treatment for low-Pr TNBCs.
40608008	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	spaLLM: enhancing spatial domain analysis in multi-omics data through large language model integration.	Spatial multi-omics technologies provide valuable data on gene expression from various omics in the same tissue section while preserving spatial information. However, deciphering spatial domains within spatial omics data remains challenging due to the sparse gene expression. We propose spaLLM, the first multi-omics spatial domain analysis method that integrates large language models to enhance data representation. Our method combines a pre-trained single-cell language model (scGPT) with graph neural networks and multi-view attention mechanisms to compensate for limited gene expression information in spatial omics while improving sensitivity and resolution within modalities. SpaLLM processes multiple spatial modalities, including RNA, chromatin, and protein data, potentially adapting to emerging technologies and accommodating additional modalities. Benchmarking against eight state-of-the-art methods across four different datasets and platforms demonstrates that our model consistently outperforms other advanced methods across multiple supervised evaluation metrics. The source code for spaLLM is freely available at https://github.com/liiilongyi/spaLLM.
36050488	2022	Nature methods	Cell type-specific inference of differential expression in spatial transcriptomics.	A central problem in spatial transcriptomics is detecting differentially expressed (DE) genes within cell types across tissue context. Challenges to learning DE include changing cell type composition across space and measurement pixels detecting transcripts from multiple cell types. Here, we introduce a statistical method, cell type-specific inference of differential expression (C-SIDE), that identifies cell type-specific DE in spatial transcriptomics, accounting for localization of other cell types. We model gene expression as an additive mixture across cell types of log-linear cell type-specific expression functions. C-SIDE's framework applies to many contexts: DE due to pathology, anatomical regions, cell-to-cell interactions and cellular microenvironment. Furthermore, C-SIDE enables statistical inference across multiple/replicates. Simulations and validation experiments on Slide-seq, MERFISH and Visium datasets demonstrate that C-SIDE accurately identifies DE with valid uncertainty quantification. Last, we apply C-SIDE to identify plaque-dependent immune activity in Alzheimer's disease and cellular interactions between tumor and immune cells. We distribute C-SIDE within the R package https://github.com/dmcable/spacexr .
35253896	2022	Nucleic acids research	STRIDE: accurately decomposing and integrating spatial transcriptomics using single-cell RNA sequencing.	The recent advances in spatial transcriptomics have brought unprecedented opportunities to understand the cellular heterogeneity in the spatial context. However, the current limitations of spatial technologies hamper the exploration of cellular localizations and interactions at single-cell level. Here, we present spatial transcriptomics deconvolution by topic modeling (STRIDE), a computational method to decompose cell types from spatial mixtures by leveraging topic profiles trained from single-cell transcriptomics. STRIDE accurately estimated the cell-type proportions and showed balanced specificity and sensitivity compared to existing methods. We demonstrated STRIDE's utility by applying it to different spatial platforms and biological systems. Deconvolution by STRIDE not only mapped rare cell types to spatial locations but also improved the identification of spatially localized genes and domains. Moreover, topics discovered by STRIDE were associated with cell-type-specific functions and could be further used to integrate successive sections and reconstruct the three-dimensional architecture of tissues. Taken together, STRIDE is a versatile and extensible tool for integrated analysis of spatial and single-cell transcriptomics and is publicly available at https://github.com/wanglabtongji/STRIDE.
37941143	2024	Nucleic acids research	SilkMeta: a comprehensive platform for sharing and exploiting pan-genomic and multi-omic silkworm data.	The silkworm Bombyx mori is a domesticated insect that serves as an animal model for research and agriculture. The silkworm super-pan-genome dataset, which we published last year, is a unique resource for the study of global genomic diversity and phenotype-genotype association. Here we present SilkMeta (http://silkmeta.org.cn), a comprehensive database covering the available silkworm pan-genome and multi-omics data. The database contains 1082 short-read genomes, 546 long-read assembled genomes, 1168 transcriptomes, 294 phenotype characterizations (phenome), tens of millions of variations (variome), 7253 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), 18 717 full length transcripts and a set of population statistics. We have compiled publications on functional genomics research and genetic stock deciphering (mutant map). A range of bioinformatics tools is also provided for data visualization and retrieval. The large batch of omics data and tools were integrated in twelve functional modules that provide useful strategies and data for comparative and functional genomics research. The interactive bioinformatics platform SilkMeta will benefit not only the silkworm but also the insect biology communities.
41026788	2025	PLoS computational biology	A graph neural network-based spatial multi-omics data integration method for deciphering spatial domains.	Recent advancements of spatial sequencing technologies enable measurements of transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles within the same tissue slice, providing an unprecedented opportunity to understand cellular microenvironments. However, effective approaches for the integrative analysis of such spatial multi-omics data are lacking. Here, we propose SpaMI, a graph neural network-based model which extract features by contrastive learning strategy for each omics and integrate different omics by an attention mechanism to integrate spatial multi-omics data. We applied SpaMI to both simulated data and three real spatial multi-omics datasets derived from the same tissue slices, including spatial epigenome-transcriptome and transcriptome-proteome data. By comparing SpaMI with the state-of-the-art methods on simulation and real datasets, we demonstrate the superior performance of SpaMI in identifying spatial domain and data denoising.
36242564	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	ICSDA: a multi-modal deep learning model to predict breast cancer recurrence and metastasis risk by integrating pathological, clinical and gene expression data.	Breast cancer patients often have recurrence and metastasis after surgery. Predicting the risk of recurrence and metastasis for a breast cancer patient is essential for the development of precision treatment. In this study, we proposed a novel multi-modal deep learning prediction model by integrating hematoxylin & eosin (H&E)-stained histopathological images, clinical information and gene expression data. Specifically, we segmented tumor regions in H&E into image blocks (256 x 256 pixels) and encoded each image block into a 1D feature vector using a deep neural network. Then, the attention module scored each area of the H&E-stained images and combined image features with clinical and gene expression data to predict the risk of recurrence and metastasis for each patient. To test the model, we downloaded all 196 breast cancer samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas with clinical, gene expression and H&E information simultaneously available. The samples were then divided into the training and testing sets with a ratio of 7: 3, in which the distributions of the samples were kept between the two datasets by hierarchical sampling. The multi-modal model achieved an area-under-the-curve value of 0.75 on the testing set better than those based solely on H&E image, sequencing data and clinical data, respectively. This study might have clinical significance in identifying high-risk breast cancer patients, who may benefit from postoperative adjuvant treatment.
41263938	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Accelerate the discovery of genetic variants in mitochondrial diseases with Variant prIOritization using Latent spAce.	Interpreting variants from whole-exome sequencing remains a major challenge, particularly for heterogeneous disorders such as mitochondrial diseases (MDs). To address this, we have developed Variant prIoritizatiOn using Latent spAce (VIOLA), a pipeline designed to help find a diagnosis for complex cases. VIOLA uses a variational autoencoder to embed functional annotations into a low-dimensional space, followed by DBSCAN-based outlier detection to identify potential pathogenic variants. Filtering steps and phenotype integration via HPO terms are then applied. The VIOLA score (Vscore) combines variant outlierness, transcriptomic co-expression data, and MD-specific annotations. Two rankings are derived: the VIOLA rank (all variants) and the ARrank (variants compatible with autosomal recessive inheritance). The VIOLA Aggregated score (VAscore) merges Vscore with Exomiser's pathogenicity score. Applied to 20 patients (four diagnosed), VIOLA reduced the variant list by >99% and ranked causal variants within the top 5 using ARrank, outperforming existing methods. Overall, VIOLA is a patient-specific strategy for variant prioritization, helping to resolve challenging MD cases and uncover novel disease mechanisms.
40116657	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	MOSim: bulk and single-cell multilayer regulatory network simulator.	As multi-omics sequencing technologies advance, the need for simulation tools capable of generating realistic and diverse (bulk and single-cell) multi-omics datasets for method testing and benchmarking becomes increasingly important. We present MOSim, an R package that simulates both bulk (via mosim function) and single-cell (via sc_mosim function) multi-omics data. The mosim function generates bulk transcriptomics data (RNA-seq) and additional regulatory omics layers (ATAC-seq, miRNA-seq, ChIP-seq, Methyl-seq, and transcription factors), while sc_mosim simulates single-cell transcriptomics data (scRNA-seq) with scATAC-seq and transcription factors as regulatory layers. The tool supports various experimental designs, including simulation of gene co-expression patterns, biological replicates, and differential expression between conditions. MOSim enables users to generate quantification matrices for each simulated omics data type, capturing the heterogeneity and complexity of bulk and single-cell multi-omics datasets. Furthermore, MOSim provides differentially abundant features within each omics layer and elucidates the active regulatory relationships between regulatory omics and gene expression data at both bulk and single-cell levels. By leveraging MOSim, researchers will be able to generate realistic and customizable bulk and single-cell multi-omics datasets to benchmark and validate analytical methods specifically designed for the integrative analysis of diverse regulatory omics data.
30957844	2019	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Unsupervised discovery of phenotype-specific multi-omics networks.	MOTIVATION: Complex diseases often involve a wide spectrum of phenotypic traits. Better understanding of the biological mechanisms relevant to each trait promotes understanding of the etiology of the disease and the potential for targeted and effective treatment plans. There have been many efforts towards omics data integration and network reconstruction, but limited work has examined the incorporation of relevant (quantitative) phenotypic traits. RESULTS: We propose a novel technique, sparse multiple canonical correlation network analysis (SmCCNet), for integrating multiple omics data types along with a quantitative phenotype of interest, and for constructing multi-omics networks that are specific to the phenotype. As a case study, we focus on miRNA-mRNA networks. Through simulations, we demonstrate that SmCCNet has better overall prediction performance compared to popular gene expression network construction and integration approaches under realistic settings. Applying SmCCNet to studies on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and breast cancer, we found enrichment of known relevant pathways (e.g. the Cadherin pathway for COPD and the interferon-gamma signaling pathway for breast cancer) as well as less known omics features that may be important to the diseases. Although those applications focus on miRNA-mRNA co-expression networks, SmCCNet is applicable to a variety of omics and other data types. It can also be easily generalized to incorporate multiple quantitative phenotype simultaneously. The versatility of SmCCNet suggests great potential of the approach in many areas. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The SmCCNet algorithm is written in R, and is freely available on the web at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SmCCNet/index.html. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
34175939	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Identifying driver genes for individual patients through inductive matrix completion.	MOTIVATION: The driver genes play a key role in the evolutionary process of cancer. Effectively identifying these driver genes is crucial to cancer diagnosis and treatment. However, due to the high heterogeneity of cancers, it remains challenging to identify the driver genes for individual patients. Although some computational methods have been proposed to tackle this problem, they seldom consider the fact that the genes functionally similar to the well-established driver genes may likely play similar roles in cancer process, which potentially promotes the driver gene identification. Thus, here we developed a novel approach of IMCDriver to promote the driver gene identification both for cohorts and individual patients. RESULTS: IMCDriver first considers the well-established driver genes as prior information, and adopts the using multi-omics data (e.g. somatic mutation, gene expression and protein-protein interaction) to compute the similarity between patients/genes. Then, IMCDriver prioritizes the personalized mutated genes according to their functional similarity to the well-established driver genes via Inductive Matrix Completion. Finally, IMCDriver identifies the highly rank-ordered genes as the personalized driver genes. The results on five cancer datasets from the Cancer Genome Consortium show that our IMCDriver outperforms other existing state-of-the-art methods both in the cohort and patient-specific driver gene identification. IMCDriver also reveals some novel driver genes that potentially drive cancer development. In addition, even for the driver genes rarely mutated among a population, IMCDriver can still identify them and prioritize them with high priorities. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Code available at https://github.com/NWPU-903PR/IMCDriver. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
39965034	2025	PLoS computational biology	SpatialKNifeY (SKNY): Extending from spatial domain to surrounding area to identify microenvironment features with single-cell spatial omics data.	Single-cell spatial omics analysis requires consideration of biological functions and mechanisms in a microenvironment. However, microenvironment analysis using bioinformatic methods is limited by the need to detect histological morphology and extend it to the surrounding area. In this study, we developed SpatialKNifeY (SKNY), an image-processing-based toolkit that detects spatial domains that potentially reflect histology and extends these domains to the microenvironment. Using spatial transcriptomic data from breast cancer, we applied the SKNY algorithm to identify tumor spatial domains, followed by clustering of the domains, trajectory estimation, and spatial extension to the tumor microenvironment (TME). The results of the trajectory estimation were consistent with the known mechanisms of cancer progression. We observed tumor vascularization and immunodeficiency at mid- and late-stage progression in TME. Furthermore, we applied the SKNY to integrate and cluster the spatial domains of 14 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, and the clusters were divided based on the TME characteristics. In conclusion, the SKNY facilitates the determination of the functions and mechanisms in the microenvironment and cataloguing of the features.
34791021	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	Machine learning meets omics: applications and perspectives.	The innovation of biotechnologies has allowed the accumulation of omics data at an alarming rate, thus introducing the era of 'big data'. Extracting inherent valuable knowledge from various omics data remains a daunting problem in bioinformatics. Better solutions often need some kind of more innovative methods for efficient handlings and effective results. Recent advancements in integrated analysis and computational modeling of multi-omics data helped address such needs in an increasingly harmonious manner. The development and application of machine learning have largely advanced our insights into biology and biomedicine and greatly promoted the development of therapeutic strategies, especially for precision medicine. Here, we propose a comprehensive survey and discussion on what happened, is happening and will happen when machine learning meets omics. Specifically, we describe how artificial intelligence can be applied to omics studies and review recent advancements at the interface between machine learning and the ever-widest range of omics including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, radiomics, as well as those at the single-cell resolution. We also discuss and provide a synthesis of ideas, new insights, current challenges and perspectives of machine learning in omics.
33603203	2022	Nature biotechnology	Robust decomposition of cell type mixtures in spatial transcriptomics.	A limitation of spatial transcriptomics technologies is that individual measurements may contain contributions from multiple cells, hindering the discovery of cell-type-specific spatial patterns of localization and expression. Here, we develop robust cell type decomposition (RCTD), a computational method that leverages cell type profiles learned from single-cell RNA-seq to decompose cell type mixtures while correcting for differences across sequencing technologies. We demonstrate the ability of RCTD to detect mixtures and identify cell types on simulated datasets. Furthermore, RCTD accurately reproduces known cell type and subtype localization patterns in Slide-seq and Visium datasets of the mouse brain. Finally, we show how RCTD's recovery of cell type localization enables the discovery of genes within a cell type whose expression depends on spatial environment. Spatial mapping of cell types with RCTD enables the spatial components of cellular identity to be defined, uncovering new principles of cellular organization in biological tissue. RCTD is publicly available as an open-source R package at https://github.com/dmcable/RCTD .

Current computational methods for single-cell cross-modality translation lack biological interpretability. Here, we present Cisformer, a cross-attention-based generative model tailored for cross-modality generation between gene expression and chromatin accessibility at single-cell resolution. Systematic benchmarking demonstrates the superior accuracy and generalization of Cisformer against existing methods. Cisformer leverages its inherent interpretability to precisely link cis-regulatory elements to target genes, facilitating the identification of functional transcription factors associated with tumorigenesis and aging. Overall, Cisformer is a powerful tool for single-cell multiomic data analysis.

LnCeVar 2.0 features a user-friendly interface for searching, browsing, and analyzing data. For instance, the CeVarState interface illustrates how SNV-ceRNA events influence cell states during developmental processes, revealing interactions that determine cell fate. The CeVarSC3D and CeVarST3D tools perform multilevel cross talk analyses of SNVs, ceRNA networks, and cell states in disease pathology, providing interactive 3D visualizations. Overall, we anticipate that the updated database will facilitate the high-resolution investigation of SNV-ceRNA networks and advance our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms in complex disease ecosystems.
38935799	2024	PLoS computational biology	ST-CellSeg: Cell segmentation for imaging-based spatial transcriptomics using multi-scale manifold learning.	Spatial transcriptomics has gained popularity over the past decade due to its ability to evaluate transcriptome data while preserving spatial information. Cell segmentation is a crucial step in spatial transcriptomic analysis, as it enables the avoidance of unpredictable tissue disentanglement steps. Although high-quality cell segmentation algorithms can aid in the extraction of valuable data, traditional methods are frequently non-spatial, do not account for spatial information efficiently, and perform poorly when confronted with the problem of spatial transcriptome cell segmentation with varying shapes. In this study, we propose ST-CellSeg, an image-based machine learning method for spatial transcriptomics that uses manifold for cell segmentation and is novel in its consideration of multi-scale information. We first construct a fully connected graph which acts as a spatial transcriptomic manifold. Using multi-scale data, we then determine the low-dimensional spatial probability distribution representation for cell segmentation. Using the adjusted Rand index (ARI), normalized mutual information (NMI), and Silhouette coefficient (SC) as model performance measures, the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms baseline models in selected datasets and is efficient in computational complexity.
40880285	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	PLSKO: a robust knockoff generator to control false discovery rate in omics variable selection.	MOTIVATION: Integrating the knockoff framework with any variable-selection method delivers stringent false discovery rate (FDR) control without recourse to p-values, offering a powerful alternative for differential expression analysis of high-throughput omics datasets. However, existing knockoff generators rely on restrictive modelling assumptions or coarse approximations that often inflate the FDR when applied to real-world data. RESULTS: We introduce Partial Least Squares Knockoff (PLSKO), an efficient, assumption-free generator that remains robust across diverse omics platforms. Our extensive simulations show that PLSKO is the only method to maintain FDR control with sufficient power in complex non-linear settings. Our semi-simulation studies drawn from RNA-seq, proteomics, metabolomics, and microbiome experiments confirm PLSKO generates valid knockoff variables. In pre-eclampsia multi-omics case studies, we combine PLSKO with Aggregation Knockoff to address the randomness of knockoffs and improve power, and demonstrate the method's ability to recover biologically meaningful features. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Our proposed algorithm is available on Github (https://github.com/guannan-yang/PLSKO) and Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16879594).
37862237	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	stVAE deconvolves cell-type composition in large-scale cellular resolution spatial transcriptomics.	MOTIVATION: Recent rapid developments in spatial transcriptomic techniques at cellular resolution have gained increasing attention. However, the unique characteristics of large-scale cellular resolution spatial transcriptomic datasets, such as the limited number of transcripts captured per spot and the vast number of spots, pose significant challenges to current cell-type deconvolution methods. RESULTS: In this study, we introduce stVAE, a method based on the variational autoencoder framework to deconvolve the cell-type composition of cellular resolution spatial transcriptomic datasets. To assess the performance of stVAE, we apply it to five datasets across three different biological tissues. In the Stereo-seq and Slide-seqV2 datasets of the mouse brain, stVAE accurately reconstructs the laminar structure of the pyramidal cell layers in the cortex, which are mainly organized by the subtypes of telencephalon projecting excitatory neurons. In the Stereo-seq dataset of the E12.5 mouse embryo, stVAE resolves the complex spatial patterns of osteoblast subtypes, which are supported by their marker genes. In Stereo-seq and Pixel-seq datasets of the mouse olfactory bulb, stVAE accurately delineates the spatial distributions of known cell types. In summary, stVAE can accurately identify spatial patterns of cell types and their relative proportions across spots for cellular resolution spatial transcriptomic data. It is instrumental in understanding the heterogeneity of cell populations and their interactions within tissues. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: stVAE is available in GitHub (https://github.com/lichen2018/stVAE) and Figshare (https://figshare.com/articles/software/stVAE/23254538).
33971669	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	Integrative-omics for discovery of network-level disease biomarkers: a case study in Alzheimer's disease.	A large number of genetic variations have been identified to be associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related quantitative traits. However, majority of existing studies focused on single types of omics data, lacking the power of generating a community including multi-omic markers and their functional connections. Because of this, the immense value of multi-omics data on AD has attracted much attention. Leveraging genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic data, and their backbone network through functional relations, we proposed a modularity-constrained logistic regression model to mine the association between disease status and a group of functionally connected multi-omic features, i.e. single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), genes and proteins. This new model was applied to the real data collected from the frontal cortex tissue in the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project cohort. Compared with other state-of-art methods, it provided overall the best prediction performance during cross-validation. This new method helped identify a group of densely connected SNPs, genes and proteins predictive of AD status. These SNPs are mostly expression quantitative trait loci in the frontal region. Brain-wide gene expression profile of these genes and proteins were highly correlated with the brain activation map of 'vision', a brain function partly controlled by frontal cortex. These genes and proteins were also found to be associated with the amyloid deposition, cortical volume and average thickness of frontal regions. Taken together, these results suggested a potential pathway underlying the development of AD from SNPs to gene expression, protein expression and ultimately brain functional and structural changes.
39710435	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	stHGC: a self-supervised graph representation learning for spatial domain recognition with hybrid graph and spatial regularization.	Advancements in spatial transcriptomics (ST) technology have enabled the analysis of gene expression while preserving cellular spatial information, greatly enhancing our understanding of cellular interactions within tissues. Accurate identification of spatial domains is crucial for comprehending tissue organization. However, the effective integration of spatial location and gene expression still faces significant challenges. To address this challenge, we propose a novel self-supervised graph representation learning framework named stHGC for identifying spatial domains. Firstly, a hybrid neighbor graph is constructed by integrating different similarity metrics to represent spatial proximity and high-dimensional gene expression features. Secondly, a self-supervised graph representation learning framework is introduced to learn the representation of spots in ST data. Within this framework, the graph attention mechanism is utilized to characterize relationships between adjacent spots, and the self-supervised method ensures distinct representations for non-neighboring spots. Lastly, a spatial regularization constraint is employed to enable the model to retain the structural information of spatial neighbors. Experimental results demonstrate that stHGC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identifying spatial domains across ST datasets with different resolutions. Furthermore, stHGC has been proven to be beneficial for downstream tasks such as denoising and trajectory inference, showcasing its scalability in handling ST data.
35255493	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	Bibliometric review of ATAC-Seq and its application in gene expression.	With recent advances in high-throughput next-generation sequencing, it is possible to describe the regulation and expression of genes at multiple levels. An assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq), which uses Tn5 transposase to sequence protein-free binding regions of the genome, can be combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) and ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNA-seq) to provide a detailed description of gene expression. Here, we reviewed the literature on ATAC-seq and described the characteristics of ATAC-seq publications. We then briefly introduced the principles of RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq, focusing on the main features of the techniques. We built a phylogenetic tree from species that had been previously studied by using ATAC-seq. Studies of Mus musculus and Homo sapiens account for approximately 90% of the total ATAC-seq data, while other species are still in the process of accumulating data. We summarized the findings from human diseases and other species, illustrating the cutting-edge discoveries and the role of multi-omics data analysis in current research. Moreover, we collected and compared ATAC-seq analysis pipelines, which allowed biological researchers who lack programming skills to better analyze and explore ATAC-seq data. Through this review, it is clear that multi-omics analysis and single-cell sequencing technology will become the mainstream approach in future research.
32070398	2020	Genome biology	Protein velocity and acceleration from single-cell multiomics experiments.	The simultaneous quantification of protein and RNA makes possible the inference of past, present, and future cell states from single experimental snapshots. To enable such temporal analysis from multimodal single-cell experiments, we introduce an extension of the RNA velocity method that leverages estimates of unprocessed transcript and protein abundances to extrapolate cell states. We apply the model to six datasets and demonstrate consistency among cell landscapes and phase portraits. The analysis software is available as the protaccel Python package.
31510655	2019	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Integrating regulatory DNA sequence and gene expression to predict genome-wide chromatin accessibility across cellular contexts.	MOTIVATION: Genome-wide profiles of chromatin accessibility and gene expression in diverse cellular contexts are critical to decipher the dynamics of transcriptional regulation. Recently, convolutional neural networks have been used to learn predictive cis-regulatory DNA sequence models of context-specific chromatin accessibility landscapes. However, these context-specific regulatory sequence models cannot generalize predictions across cell types. RESULTS: We introduce multi-modal, residual neural network architectures that integrate cis-regulatory sequence and context-specific expression of trans-regulators to predict genome-wide chromatin accessibility profiles across cellular contexts. We show that the average accessibility of a genomic region across training contexts can be a surprisingly powerful predictor. We leverage this feature and employ novel strategies for training models to enhance genome-wide prediction of shared and context-specific chromatin accessible sites across cell types. We interpret the models to reveal insights into cis- and trans-regulation of chromatin dynamics across 123 diverse cellular contexts.

40905789	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	stImage: a versatile framework for optimizing spatial transcriptomic analysis through customizable deep histology and location informed integration.	Spatial transcriptomics (ST) integrates gene expression data with the spatial organization of cells and their associated histology, offering unprecedented insights into tissue biology. While existing methods incorporate either location-based or histology-informed information, none fully synergize gene expression, histological features, and precise spatial coordinates within a unified framework. Moreover, these methods often exhibit inconsistent performance across diverse datasets and conditions. Here, we introduce stImage, an open-source R package that provides a comprehensive and flexible solution for ST analysis. By generating deep learning-derived histology features and offering 54 integrative strategies, stImage seamlessly combines transcriptional profiles, histology images, and spatial information. We demonstrate stImage's effectiveness across multiple datasets, underscoring its ability to guide users toward the most suitable integration strategy using diagnostic graph. Our results highlight how stImage can optimize ST, consistently improving biological insights and advancing our understanding of tissue architecture. stImage is freely available at https://github.com/YuWang-VUMC/stImage.
37156914	2023	Nature biotechnology	Multimodal spatiotemporal phenotyping of human retinal organoid development.	Organoids generated from human pluripotent stem cells provide experimental systems to study development and disease, but quantitative measurements across different spatial scales and molecular modalities are lacking. In this study, we generated multiplexed protein maps over a retinal organoid time course and primary adult human retinal tissue. We developed a toolkit to visualize progenitor and neuron location, the spatial arrangements of extracellular and subcellular components and global patterning in each organoid and primary tissue. In addition, we generated a single-cell transcriptome and chromatin accessibility timecourse dataset and inferred a gene regulatory network underlying organoid development. We integrated genomic data with spatially segmented nuclei into a multimodal atlas to explore organoid patterning and retinal ganglion cell (RGC) spatial neighborhoods, highlighting pathways involved in RGC cell death and showing that mosaic genetic perturbations in retinal organoids provide insight into cell fate regulation.
39075536	2024	Genome biology	scCross: a deep generative model for unifying single-cell multi-omics with seamless integration, cross-modal generation, and in silico exploration.	Single-cell multi-omics data reveal complex cellular states, providing significant insights into cellular dynamics and disease. Yet, integration of multi-omics data presents challenges. Some modalities have not reached the robustness or clarity of established transcriptomics. Coupled with data scarcity for less established modalities and integration intricacies, these challenges limit our ability to maximize single-cell omics benefits. We introduce scCross, a tool leveraging variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and the mutual nearest neighbors (MNN) technique for modality alignment. By enabling single-cell cross-modal data generation, multi-omics data simulation, and in silico cellular perturbations, scCross enhances the utility of single-cell multi-omics studies.
32379315	2020	Nucleic acids research	BREM-SC: a bayesian random effects mixture model for joint clustering single cell multi-omics data.	Droplet-based single cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology, largely represented by the 10x Genomics Chromium system, is able to measure the gene expression from tens of thousands of single cells simultaneously. More recently, coupled with the cutting-edge Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing (CITE-seq), the droplet-based system has allowed for immunophenotyping of single cells based on cell surface expression of specific proteins together with simultaneous transcriptome profiling in the same cell. Despite the rapid advances in technologies, novel statistical methods and computational tools for analyzing multi-modal CITE-Seq data are lacking. In this study, we developed BREM-SC, a novel Bayesian Random Effects Mixture model that jointly clusters paired single cell transcriptomic and proteomic data. Through simulation studies and analysis of public and in-house real data sets, we successfully demonstrated the validity and advantages of this method in fully utilizing both types of data to accurately identify cell clusters. In addition, as a probabilistic model-based approach, BREM-SC is able to quantify the clustering uncertainty for each single cell. This new method will greatly facilitate researchers to jointly study transcriptome and surface proteins at the single cell level to make new biological discoveries, particularly in the area of immunology.
39930543	2025	Genome biology	Multi-omics analysis in primary T cells elucidates mechanisms behind disease-associated genetic loci.	BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have uncovered the genetic basis behind many diseases and conditions. However, most of these genetic loci affect regulatory regions, making the interpretation challenging. Chromatin conformation has a fundamental role in gene regulation and is frequently used to associate potential target genes to regulatory regions. However, previous studies mostly used small sample sizes and immortalized cell lines instead of primary cells. RESULTS: Here we present the most extensive dataset of chromatin conformation with matching gene expression and chromatin accessibility from primary CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells to date, isolated from psoriatic arthritis patients and healthy controls. We generated 108 Hi-C libraries (49 billion reads), 128 RNA-seq libraries and 126 ATAC-seq libraries. These data enhance our understanding of the mechanisms by which GWAS variants impact gene regulation, revealing how genetic variation alters chromatin accessibility and structure in primary cells at an unprecedented scale. We refine the mapping of GWAS loci to implicated regulatory elements, such as CTCF binding sites and other enhancer elements, aiding gene assignment. We uncover BCL2L11 as the probable causal gene within the rheumatoid arthritis (RA) locus rs13396472, despite the GWAS variants' intronic positioning relative to ACOXL, and we identify mechanisms involving SESN3 dysregulation in the RA locus rs4409785. CONCLUSIONS: Given these genes' significant role in T cell development and maturation, our work deepens our comprehension of autoimmune disease pathogenesis, suggesting potential treatment targets. In addition, our dataset provides a valuable resource for the investigation of immune-mediated diseases and gene regulatory mechanisms.
41045511	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	MegSite: an accurate nucleic acid-binding residue prediction method based on multimodal protein language model.	Accurate identification of nucleic acid-binding residues is crucial for understanding protein-nucleic acid interactions, which play a key role in gene expression research and the discovery of regulatory mechanisms. Despite numerous computational efforts to address this challenge, achieving high accuracy remains difficult due to the complexity of extracting meaningful insights from proteins. Here, we introduce MegSite, a novel multimodal protein language model-informed method that integrates discriminative knowledge from protein sequence, structure, and function. This work presents the first integration of ESM3 multimodal features for nucleic acid-binding site prediction. MegSite significantly outperforms existing prediction methods, as evidenced by its performance on multiple independent test sets. The Matthews correlation coefficient values achieved by MegSite on DNA-129_Test, DNA-181_Test, RNA-117_Test, and RNA-285_Test are 0.567, 0.444, 0.411, and 0.421, representing the improvements of 2.72%, 7.66%, 1.22% and 6.58% over the second-best method separately. Notably, MegSite demonstrates robust performance even on proteins with low structural similarity, surpassing the previous structure-based methods. Furthermore, this method is seamlessly extendable to the predicted protein structure and a newly released RNA-binding residue test set with high accuracy, highlighting its broad applicability. Comprehensive experimental results reveal that the superior performance of MegSite is attributed to its effective integration of multimodal protein knowledge.
36063455	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	SD2: spatially resolved transcriptomics deconvolution through integration of dropout and spatial information.	MOTIVATION: Unveiling the heterogeneity in the tissues is crucial to explore cell-cell interactions and cellular targets of human diseases. Spatial transcriptomics (ST) supplies spatial gene expression profile which has revolutionized our biological understanding, but variations in cell-type proportions of each spot with dozens of cells would confound downstream analysis. Therefore, deconvolution of ST has been an indispensable step and a technical challenge toward the higher-resolution panorama of tissues. RESULTS: Here, we propose a novel ST deconvolution method called SD2 integrating spatial information of ST data and embracing an important characteristic, dropout, which is traditionally considered as an obstruction in single-cell RNA sequencing data (scRNA-seq) analysis. First, we extract the dropout-based genes as informative features from ST and scRNA-seq data by fitting a Michaelis-Menten function. After synthesizing pseudo-ST spots by randomly composing cells from scRNA-seq data, auto-encoder is applied to discover low-dimensional and non-linear representation of the real- and pseudo-ST spots. Next, we create a graph containing embedded profiles as nodes, and edges determined by transcriptional similarity and spatial relationship. Given the graph, a graph convolutional neural network is used to predict the cell-type compositions for real-ST spots. We benchmark the performance of SD2 on the simulated seqFISH+ dataset with different resolutions and measurements which show superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods. SD2 is further validated on three real-world datasets with different ST technologies and demonstrates the capability to localize cell-type composition accurately with quantitative evidence. Finally, ablation study is conducted to verify the contribution of different modules proposed in SD2. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The SD2 is freely available in github (https://github.com/leihouyeung/SD2) and Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7024684). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
33279962	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	Coupled co-clustering-based unsupervised transfer learning for the integrative analysis of single-cell genomic data.	Unsupervised methods, such as clustering methods, are essential to the analysis of single-cell genomic data. The most current clustering methods are designed for one data type only, such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) or sc-methylation data alone, and a few are developed for the integrative analysis of multiple data types. The integrative analysis of multimodal single-cell genomic data sets leverages the power in multiple data sets and can deepen the biological insight. In this paper, we propose a coupled co-clustering-based unsupervised transfer learning algorithm (coupleCoC) for the integrative analysis of multimodal single-cell data. Our proposed coupleCoC builds upon the information theoretic co-clustering framework. In co-clustering, both the cells and the genomic features are simultaneously clustered. Clustering similar genomic features reduces the noise in single-cell data and facilitates transfer of knowledge across single-cell datasets. We applied coupleCoC for the integrative analysis of scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq data, sc-methylation and scRNA-seq data and scRNA-seq data from mouse and human. We demonstrate that coupleCoC improves the overall clustering performance and matches the cell subpopulations across multimodal single-cell genomic datasets. Our method coupleCoC is also computationally efficient and can scale up to large datasets. Availability: The software and datasets are available at https://github.com/cuhklinlab/coupleCoC.
29553579	2018	Nature methods	SpatialDE: identification of spatially variable genes.	Technological advances have made it possible to measure spatially resolved gene expression at high throughput. However, methods to analyze these data are not established. Here we describe SpatialDE, a statistical test to identify genes with spatial patterns of expression variation from multiplexed imaging or spatial RNA-sequencing data. SpatialDE also implements 'automatic expression histology', a spatial gene-clustering approach that enables expression-based tissue histology.
37756699	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	ScribbleDom: using scribble-annotated histology images to identify domains in spatial transcriptomics data.	"MOTIVATION: Spatial domain identification is a very important problem in the field of spatial transcriptomics. The state-of-the-art solutions to this problem focus on unsupervised methods, as there is lack of data for a supervised learning formulation. The results obtained from these methods highlight significant opportunities for improvement. RESULTS: In this article, we propose a potential avenue for enhancement through the development of a semi-supervised convolutional neural network based approach. Named ""ScribbleDom"", our method leverages human expert's input as a form of semi-supervision, thereby seamlessly combines the cognitive abilities of human experts with the computational power of machines. ScribbleDom incorporates a loss function that integrates two crucial components: similarity in gene expression profiles and adherence to the valuable input of a human annotator through scribbles on histology images, providing prior knowledge about spot labels. The spatial continuity of the tissue domains is taken into account by extracting information on the spot microenvironment through convolution filters of varying sizes, in the form of ""Inception"" blocks. By leveraging this semi-supervised approach, ScribbleDom significantly improves the quality of spatial domains, yielding superior results both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the clear edge of ScribbleDom over state-of-the-art methods-between 1.82% to 169.38% improvements in adjusted Rand index for 9 of the 12 human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples, and 15.54% improvement in the melanoma cancer dataset. Notably, when the expert input is absent, ScribbleDom can still operate, in a fully unsupervised manner like the state-of-the-art methods, and produces results that remain competitive. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Source code is available at Github (https://github.com/1alnoman/ScribbleDom) and Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/681572669)."
38637899	2024	Genome biology	Library size confounds biology in spatial transcriptomics data.	Spatial molecular data has transformed the study of disease microenvironments, though, larger datasets pose an analytics challenge prompting the direct adoption of single-cell RNA-sequencing tools including normalization methods. Here, we demonstrate that library size is associated with tissue structure and that normalizing these effects out using commonly applied scRNA-seq normalization methods will negatively affect spatial domain identification. Spatial data should not be specifically corrected for library size prior to analysis, and algorithms designed for scRNA-seq data should be adopted with caution.
35288749	2022	Nucleic acids research	Genome-wide landscape of ApiAP2 transcription factors reveals a heterochromatin-associated regulatory network during Plasmodium falciparum blood-stage development.	Heterochromatin-associated gene silencing controls multiple physiological processes in malaria parasites, however, little is known concerning the regulatory network and cis-acting sequences involved in the organization of heterochromatin and how they modulate heterochromatic gene expression. Based on systematic profiling of genome-wide occupancy of eighteen Apicomplexan AP2 transcription factors by ChIP-seq analysis, we identify and characterize eight heterochromatin-associated factors (PfAP2-HFs), which exhibit preferential enrichment within heterochromatic regions but with differential coverage profiles. Although these ApiAP2s target euchromatic gene loci via specific DNA motifs, they are likely integral components of heterochromatin independent of DNA motif recognition. Systematic knockout screenings of ApiAP2 factors coupled with RNA-seq transcriptomic profiling revealed three activators and three repressors of heterochromatic gene expression including four PfAP2-HFs. Notably, expression of virulence genes is either completely silenced or significantly reduced upon the depletion of PfAP2-HC. Integrated multi-omics analyses reveal autoregulation and feed-forward loops to be common features of the ApiAP2 regulatory network, in addition to the occurrence of dynamic interplay between local chromatin structure and ApiAP2s in transcriptional control. Collectively, this study provides a valuable resource describing the genome-wide landscape of the ApiAP2 family and insights into functional divergence and cooperation within this family during the blood-stage development of malaria parasites.
38811360	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	SpaNCMG: improving spatial domains identification of spatial transcriptomics using neighborhood-complementary mixed-view graph convolutional network.	The advancement of spatial transcriptomics (ST) technology contributes to a more profound comprehension of the spatial properties of gene expression within tissues. However, due to challenges of high dimensionality, pronounced noise and dynamic limitations in ST data, the integration of gene expression and spatial information to accurately identify spatial domains remains challenging. This paper proposes a SpaNCMG algorithm for the purpose of achieving precise spatial domain description and localization based on a neighborhood-complementary mixed-view graph convolutional network. The algorithm enables better adaptation to ST data at different resolutions by integrating the local information from KNN and the global structure from r-radius into a complementary neighborhood graph. It also introduces an attention mechanism to achieve adaptive fusion of different reconstructed expressions, and utilizes KPCA method for dimensionality reduction. The application of SpaNCMG on five datasets from four sequencing platforms demonstrates superior performance to eight existing advanced methods. Specifically, the algorithm achieved highest ARI accuracies of 0.63 and 0.52 on the datasets of the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and mouse somatosensory cortex, respectively. It accurately identified the spatial locations of marker genes in the mouse olfactory bulb tissue and inferred the biological functions of different regions. When handling larger datasets such as mouse embryos, the SpaNCMG not only identified the main tissue structures but also explored unlabeled domains. Overall, the good generalization ability and scalability of SpaNCMG make it an outstanding tool for understanding tissue structure and disease mechanisms. Our codes are available at https://github.com/ZhihaoSi/SpaNCMG.
37756592	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Attention-based generative adversarial networks improve prognostic outcome prediction of cancer from multimodal data.	The prediction of prognostic outcome is critical for the development of efficient cancer therapeutics and potential personalized medicine. However, due to the heterogeneity and diversity of multimodal data of cancer, data integration and feature selection remain a challenge for prognostic outcome prediction. We proposed a deep learning method with generative adversarial network based on sequential channel-spatial attention modules (CSAM-GAN), a multimodal data integration and feature selection approach, for accomplishing prognostic stratification tasks in cancer. Sequential channel-spatial attention modules equipped with an encoder-decoder are applied for the input features of multimodal data to accurately refine selected features. A discriminator network was proposed to make the generator and discriminator learning in an adversarial way to accurately describe the complex heterogeneous information of multiple modal data. We conducted extensive experiments with various feature selection and classification methods and confirmed that the CSAM-GAN via the multilayer deep neural network (DNN) classifier outperformed these baseline methods on two different multimodal data sets with miRNA expression, mRNA expression and histopathological image data: lower-grade glioma and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma. The CSAM-GAN via the multilayer DNN classifier bridges the gap between heterogenous multimodal data and prognostic outcome prediction.
37698995	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	MoleculeExperiment enables consistent infrastructure for molecule-resolved spatial omics data in bioconductor.	MOTIVATION: Imaging-based spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies have achieved subcellular resolution, enabling detection of individual molecules in their native tissue context. Data associated with these technologies promise unprecedented opportunity toward understanding cellular and subcellular biology. However, in R/Bioconductor, there is a scarcity of existing computational infrastructure to represent such data, and particularly to summarize and transform it for existing widely adopted computational tools in single-cell transcriptomics analysis, including SingleCellExperiment and SpatialExperiment (SPE) classes. With the emergence of several commercial offerings of imaging-based ST, there is a pressing need to develop consistent data structure standards for these technologies at the individual molecule-level. RESULTS: To this end, we have developed MoleculeExperiment, an R/Bioconductor package, which (i) stores molecule and cell segmentation boundary information at the molecule-level, (ii) standardizes this molecule-level information across different imaging-based ST technologies, including 10x Genomics' Xenium, and (iii) streamlines transition from a MoleculeExperiment object to a SpatialExperiment object. Overall, MoleculeExperiment is generally applicable as a data infrastructure class for consistent analysis of molecule-resolved spatial omics data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The MoleculeExperiment package is publicly available on Bioconductor at https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MoleculeExperiment.html. Source code is available on Github at: https://github.com/SydneyBioX/MoleculeExperiment. The vignette for MoleculeExperiment can be found at https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MoleculeExperiment.html.
38058188	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Robust knowledge-guided biclustering for multi-omics data.	Biclustering is a useful method for simultaneously grouping samples and features and has been applied across various biomedical data types. However, most existing biclustering methods lack the ability to integratively analyze multi-modal data such as multi-omics data such as genome, transcriptome and epigenome. Moreover, the potential of leveraging biological knowledge represented by graphs, which has been demonstrated to be beneficial in various statistical tasks such as variable selection and prediction, remains largely untapped in the context of biclustering. To address both, we propose a novel Bayesian biclustering method called Bayesian graph-guided biclustering (BGB). Specifically, we introduce a new hierarchical sparsity-inducing prior to effectively incorporate biological graph information and establish a unified framework to model multi-view data. We develop an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to conduct posterior sampling and inference. Extensive simulations and real data analysis show that BGB outperforms other popular biclustering methods. Notably, BGB is robust in terms of utilizing biological knowledge and has the capability to reveal biologically meaningful information from heterogeneous multi-modal data.
30357387	2019	Nucleic acids research	ArrayExpress update - from bulk to single-cell expression data.	ArrayExpress (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress) is an archive of functional genomics data from a variety of technologies assaying functional modalities of a genome, such as gene expression or promoter occupancy. The number of experiments based on sequencing technologies, in particular RNA-seq experiments, has been increasing over the last few years and submissions of sequencing data have overtaken microarray experiments in the last 12 months. Additionally, there is a significant increase in experiments investigating single cells, rather than bulk samples, known as single-cell RNA-seq. To accommodate these trends, we have substantially changed our submission tool Annotare which, along with raw and processed data, collects all metadata necessary to interpret these experiments. Selected datasets are re-processed and loaded into our sister resource, the value-added Expression Atlas (and its component Single Cell Expression Atlas), which not only enables users to interpret the data easily but also serves as a test for data quality. With an increasing number of studies that combine different assay modalities (multi-omics experiments), a new more general archival resource the BioStudies Database has been developed, which will eventually supersede ArrayExpress. Data submissions will continue unchanged; all existing ArrayExpress data will be incorporated into BioStudies and the existing accession numbers and application programming interfaces will be maintained.
33571201	2021	PLoS computational biology	DEXOM: Diversity-based enumeration of optimal context-specific metabolic networks.	The correct identification of metabolic activity in tissues or cells under different conditions can be extremely elusive due to mechanisms such as post-transcriptional modification of enzymes or different rates in protein degradation, making difficult to perform predictions on the basis of gene expression alone. Context-specific metabolic network reconstruction can overcome some of these limitations by leveraging the integration of multi-omics data into genome-scale metabolic networks (GSMN). Using the experimental information, context-specific models are reconstructed by extracting from the generic GSMN the sub-network most consistent with the data, subject to biochemical constraints. One advantage is that these context-specific models have more predictive power since they are tailored to the specific tissue, cell or condition, containing only the reactions predicted to be active in such context. However, an important limitation is that there are usually many different sub-networks that optimally fit the experimental data. This set of optimal networks represent alternative explanations of the possible metabolic state. Ignoring the set of possible solutions reduces the ability to obtain relevant information about the metabolism and may bias the interpretation of the true metabolic states. In this work we formalize the problem of enumerating optimal metabolic networks and we introduce DEXOM, an unified approach for diversity-based enumeration of context-specific metabolic networks. We developed different strategies for this purpose and we performed an exhaustive analysis using simulated and real data. In order to analyze the extent to which these results are biologically meaningful, we used the alternative solutions obtained with the different methods to measure: 1) the improvement of in silico predictions of essential genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using ensembles of metabolic network; and 2) the detection of alternative enriched pathways in different human cancer cell lines. We also provide DEXOM as an open-source library compatible with COBRA Toolbox 3.0, available at https://github.com/MetExplore/dexom.
40991328	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Assessing tissue-specific gene expression of essential genes from human and mouse.	A gene is defined as essential when its functional loss compromises an organism's viability. Identifying essential genes is critical for identifying the components that regulate a biological system. Advances in gene editing techniques like CRISPR-Cas9 provide a capacity to interrogate a genome to elucidate the genes that are essential. However, these techniques are often applied for a single-cell line and rarely probed at a level of a tissue or organ. The recent availability of large-scale single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) atlases provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate essential gene expression in a more comprehensive context. Our study leverages information from benchmarking datasets, single-cell tissue atlases, and databases of essential genes, to develop a method, scEssentials, that uses a statistical framework to investigate the robustness and specificity of essential genes across multiple cell types. Using scEssentials, mouse and human models showed consistently high expression and exhibited limited variability across more than 60 cell types. We demonstrate a substantial number of significantly correlated gene pairs that produce densely connected co-expression networks with functional annotation. Finally, we develop a score to quantify the relative essentiality of genes within scEssentials, further validating their significant association with gene mutation frequency and chromatin accessibility. Using ageing as an application, we demonstrate how scEssentials identifies robust gene expression profiles. Only one-fifth of scEssentials genes showed significant ageing-related differential expression among age groups. Collectively, the robustness of scEssentials serves as a reference for analysing scRNA-seq data and provides insight into the heterogeneous nature such as ageing.
38960406	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Integrating spatial transcriptomics and bulk RNA-seq: predicting gene expression with enhanced resolution through graph attention networks.	Spatial transcriptomics data play a crucial role in cancer research, providing a nuanced understanding of the spatial organization of gene expression within tumor tissues. Unraveling the spatial dynamics of gene expression can unveil key insights into tumor heterogeneity and aid in identifying potential therapeutic targets. However, in many large-scale cancer studies, spatial transcriptomics data are limited, with bulk RNA-seq and corresponding Whole Slide Image (WSI) data being more common (e.g. TCGA project). To address this gap, there is a critical need to develop methodologies that can estimate gene expression at near-cell (spot) level resolution from existing WSI and bulk RNA-seq data. This approach is essential for reanalyzing expansive cohort studies and uncovering novel biomarkers that have been overlooked in the initial assessments. In this study, we present STGAT (Spatial Transcriptomics Graph Attention Network), a novel approach leveraging Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to discern spatial dependencies among spots. Trained on spatial transcriptomics data, STGAT is designed to estimate gene expression profiles at spot-level resolution and predict whether each spot represents tumor or non-tumor tissue, especially in patient samples where only WSI and bulk RNA-seq data are available. Comprehensive tests on two breast cancer spatial transcriptomics datasets demonstrated that STGAT outperformed existing methods in accurately predicting gene expression. Further analyses using the TCGA breast cancer dataset revealed that gene expression estimated from tumor-only spots (predicted by STGAT) provides more accurate molecular signatures for breast cancer sub-type and tumor stage prediction, and also leading to improved patient survival and disease-free analysis. Availability: Code is available at https://github.com/compbiolabucf/STGAT.
34643708	2022	Nucleic acids research	RGD v2.0: a major update of the ruminant functional and evolutionary genomics database.	Ruminant Genome Database (RGD; http://animal.nwsuaf.edu.cn/RGD) provides visualization and analysis tools for ruminant comparative genomics and functional annotations. As more high-quality ruminant genome assemblies have become available, we have redesigned the user interface, integrated and expanded multi-omics data, and developed novel features to improve the database. The new version, RGD v2.0, houses 78 ruminant genomes; 110-species synteny alignments for major livestock (including cattle, sheep, goat) and wild ungulates; 21 012 orthologous gene clusters with Gene Ontology and pathway annotation;  approximately 8 600 000 conserved elements; and  approximately 1 000 000 cis-regulatory elements by utilizing 1053 epigenomic data sets. The transcriptome data in RGD v2.0 has nearly doubled, currently with 1936 RNA-seq data sets, and 155 174 phenotypic data sets have been newly added. New and updated features include: (i) The UCSC Genome Browser, BLAT, BLAST and Table Browser tools were updated for six available ruminant livestock species. (ii) The LiftOver tool was newly introduced into our browser to allow coordinate conversion between different ruminant assemblies. And (iii) tissue specificity index, tau, was calculated to facilitate batch screening of specifically expressed genes. The enhanced genome annotations and improved functionality in RGD v2.0 will be useful for study of genome evolution, environmental adaption, livestock breeding and biomedicine.
32963031	2020	Genome research	Pan-cancer multi-omics analysis and orthogonal experimental assessment of epigenetic driver genes.	The recent identification of recurrently mutated epigenetic regulator genes (ERGs) supports their critical role in tumorigenesis. We conducted a pan-cancer analysis integrating (epi)genome, transcriptome, and DNA methylome alterations in a curated list of 426 ERGs across 33 cancer types, comprising 10,845 tumor and 730 normal tissues. We found that, in addition to mutations, copy number alterations in ERGs were more frequent than previously anticipated and tightly linked to expression aberrations. Novel bioinformatics approaches, integrating the strengths of various driver prediction and multi-omics algorithms, and an orthogonal in vitro screen (CRISPR-Cas9) targeting all ERGs revealed genes with driver roles within and across malignancies and shared driver mechanisms operating across multiple cancer types and hallmarks. This is the largest and most comprehensive analysis thus far; it is also the first experimental effort to specifically identify ERG drivers (epidrivers) and characterize their deregulation and functional impact in oncogenic processes.
37643374	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	DeepICSH: a complex deep learning framework for identifying cell-specific silencers and their strength from the human genome.	Silencers are noncoding DNA sequence fragments located on the genome that suppress gene expression. The variation of silencers in specific cells is closely related to gene expression and cancer development. Computational approaches that exclusively rely on DNA sequence information for silencer identification fail to account for the cell specificity of silencers, resulting in diminished accuracy. Despite the discovery of several transcription factors and epigenetic modifications associated with silencers on the genome, there is still no definitive biological signal or combination thereof to fully characterize silencers, posing challenges in selecting suitable biological signals for their identification. Therefore, we propose a sophisticated deep learning framework called DeepICSH, which is based on multiple biological data sources. Specifically, DeepICSH leverages a deep convolutional neural network to automatically capture biologically relevant signal combinations strongly associated with silencers, originating from a diverse array of biological signals. Furthermore, the utilization of attention mechanisms facilitates the scoring and visualization of these signal combinations, whereas the employment of skip connections facilitates the fusion of multilevel sequence features and signal combinations, thereby empowering the accurate identification of silencers within specific cells. Extensive experiments on HepG2 and K562 cell line data sets demonstrate that DeepICSH outperforms state-of-the-art methods in silencer identification. Notably, we introduce for the first time a deep learning framework based on multi-omics data for classifying strong and weak silencers, achieving favorable performance. In conclusion, DeepICSH shows great promise for advancing the study and analysis of silencers in complex diseases. The source code is available at https://github.com/lyli1013/DeepICSH.

Viral infections impose a substantial threat to human health, characterized by a wide range of pathogens, clinical manifestations, and complex immune responses. Single-cell multi-omics technologies have revolutionized the study of antiviral immunity by resolving cellular heterogeneity, transcriptional reprogramming, and clonal dynamics. However, no resource has yet comprehensively integrated such datasets in the context of viral infections. Here, we present scMOVIR, a single-cell multi-omics database for human viral infections and immune responses. The database systematically integrates transcriptomic, proteomic, and immune receptor repertoire profiles at single-cell resolution, compiling 8532 human samples across 114 viral species, subtypes, and strains. These datasets span 59 well-defined disease states, including acute and chronic infections, virus-associated malignancies, and immune-related disorders, and extend across >30 tissue types. In addition, these datasets incorporate vaccination cohorts, therapeutic interventions, and time-course models of infection. To ensure consistency and interoperability, all datasets undergo standardized preprocessing, including batch correction and unified cell-type annotation, with metadata harmonized using authoritative ontologies. scMOVIR provides user-friendly interfaces for dataset exploration and interactive visualization of cellular dynamics and molecular profiles, offering a high-resolution reference for investigating virus-host immune interactions and supporting antiviral research.

BACKGROUND: The Pharyngeal Endoderm (PE) is an extremely relevant developmental tissue, serving as the progenitor for the esophagus, parathyroids, thyroids, lungs, and thymus. While several studies have highlighted the importance of PE cells, a detailed transcriptional and epigenetic characterization of this important developmental stage is still missing, especially in humans, due to technical and ethical constraints pertaining to its early formation. RESULTS: Here we fill this knowledge gap by developing an in vitro protocol for the derivation of PE-like cells from human Embryonic Stem Cells (hESCs) and by providing an integrated multi-omics characterization. Our PE-like cells robustly express PE markers and are transcriptionally homogenous and similar to in vivo mouse PE cells. In addition, we define their epigenetic landscape and dynamic changes in response to Retinoic Acid by combining ATAC-Seq and ChIP-Seq of histone modifications. The integration of multiple high-throughput datasets leads to the identification of new putative regulatory regions and to the inference of a Retinoic Acid-centered transcription factor network orchestrating the development of PE-like cells. CONCLUSIONS: By combining hESCs differentiation with computational genomics, our work reveals the epigenetic dynamics that occur during human PE differentiation, providing a solid resource and foundation for research focused on the development of PE derivatives and the modeling of their developmental defects in genetic syndromes.
30768150	2019	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Driver network as a biomarker: systematic integration and network modeling of multi-omics data to derive driver signaling pathways for drug combination prediction.	MOTIVATION: Drug combinations that simultaneously suppress multiple cancer driver signaling pathways increase therapeutic options and may reduce drug resistance. We have developed a computational systems biology tool, DrugComboExplorer, to identify driver signaling pathways and predict synergistic drug combinations by integrating the knowledge embedded in vast amounts of available pharmacogenomics and omics data. RESULTS: This tool generates driver signaling networks by processing DNA sequencing, gene copy number, DNA methylation and RNA-seq data from individual cancer patients using an integrated pipeline of algorithms, including bootstrap aggregating-based Markov random field, weighted co-expression network analysis and supervised regulatory network learning. It uses a systems pharmacology approach to infer the combinatorial drug efficacies and synergy mechanisms through drug functional module-induced regulation of target expression analysis. Application of our tool on diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and prostate cancer demonstrated how synergistic drug combinations can be discovered to inhibit multiple driver signaling pathways. Compared with existing computational approaches, DrugComboExplorer had higher prediction accuracy based on in vitro experimental validation and probability concordance index. These results demonstrate that our network-based drug efficacy screening approach can reliably prioritize synergistic drug combinations for cancer and uncover potential mechanisms of drug synergy, warranting further studies in individual cancer patients to derive personalized treatment plans. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: DrugComboExplorer is available at https://github.com/Roosevelt-PKU/drugcombinationprediction. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
39404057	2024	Nucleic acids research	Dual decoding of cell types and gene expression in spatial transcriptomics with PANDA.	Sequencing-based spatial transcriptomics technologies have revolutionized our understanding of complex biological systems by enabling transcriptome profiling while preserving spatial context. However, spot-level expression measurements often amalgamate signals from diverse cells, obscuring potential heterogeneity. Existing methods aim to deconvolute spatial transcriptomics data into cell type proportions for each spot using single-cell RNA sequencing references but overlook cell-type-specific gene expression, essential for uncovering intra-type heterogeneity. We present PANDA (ProbAbilistic-based decoNvolution with spot-aDaptive cell type signAtures), a novel method that concurrently deciphers spot-level gene expression into both cell type proportions and cell-type-specific gene expression. PANDA integrates archetypal analysis to capture within-cell-type heterogeneity and dynamically learns cell type signatures for each spot during deconvolution. Simulations demonstrate PANDA's superior performance. Applied to real spatial transcriptomics data from diverse tissues, including tumor, brain, and developing heart, PANDA reconstructs spatial structures and reveals subtle transcriptional variations within specific cell types, offering a comprehensive understanding of tissue dynamics.
39552067	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	BFAST: joint dimension reduction and spatial clustering with Bayesian factor analysis for zero-inflated spatial transcriptomics data.	The development of spatially resolved transcriptomics (ST) technologies has made it possible to measure gene expression profiles coupled with cellular spatial context and assist biologists in comprehensively characterizing cellular phenotype heterogeneity and tissue microenvironment. Spatial clustering is vital for biological downstream analysis. However, due to high noise and dropout events, clustering spatial transcriptomics data poses numerous challenges due to the lack of effective algorithms. Here we develop a novel method, jointly performing dimension reduction and spatial clustering with Bayesian Factor Analysis for zero-inflated Spatial Transcriptomics data (BFAST). BFAST has showcased exceptional performance on simulation data and real spatial transcriptomics datasets, as proven by benchmarking against currently available methods. It effectively extracts more biologically informative low-dimensional features compared to traditional dimensionality reduction approaches, thereby enhancing the accuracy and precision of clustering.
35081109	2022	PLoS computational biology	AIME: Autoencoder-based integrative multi-omics data embedding that allows for confounder adjustments.	In the integrative analyses of omics data, it is often of interest to extract data representation from one data type that best reflect its relations with another data type. This task is traditionally fulfilled by linear methods such as canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and partial least squares (PLS). However, information contained in one data type pertaining to the other data type may be complex and in nonlinear form. Deep learning provides a convenient alternative to extract low-dimensional nonlinear data embedding. In addition, the deep learning setup can naturally incorporate the effects of clinical confounding factors into the integrative analysis. Here we report a deep learning setup, named Autoencoder-based Integrative Multi-omics data Embedding (AIME), to extract data representation for omics data integrative analysis. The method can adjust for confounder variables, achieve informative data embedding, rank features in terms of their contributions, and find pairs of features from the two data types that are related to each other through the data embedding. In simulation studies, the method was highly effective in the extraction of major contributing features between data types. Using two real microRNA-gene expression datasets, one with confounder variables and one without, we show that AIME excluded the influence of confounders, and extracted biologically plausible novel information. The R package based on Keras and the TensorFlow backend is available at https://github.com/tianwei-yu/AIME.
33837132	2021	Genome research	Mapping the regulatory landscape of auditory hair cells from single-cell multi-omics data.	Auditory hair cells transduce sound to the brain, and in mammals, these cells reside together with supporting cells in the sensory epithelium of the cochlea, called the organ of Corti. To establish the organ's delicate function during development and differentiation, spatiotemporal gene expression is strictly controlled by chromatin accessibility and cell type-specific transcription factors, jointly representing the regulatory landscape. Bulk sequencing technology and cellular heterogeneity obscured investigations on the interplay between transcription factors and chromatin accessibility in inner ear development. To study the formation of the regulatory landscape in hair cells, we collected single-cell chromatin accessibility profiles accompanied by single-cell RNA data from genetically labeled murine hair cells and supporting cells after birth. Using an integrative approach, we predicted cell type-specific activating and repressing functions of developmental transcription factors. Furthermore, by integrating gene expression and chromatin accessibility data sets, we reconstructed gene regulatory networks. Then, using a comparative approach, 20 hair cell-specific activators and repressors, including putative downstream target genes, were identified. Clustering of target genes resolved groups of related transcription factors and was used to infer their developmental functions. Finally, the heterogeneity in the single-cell data allowed us to spatially reconstruct transcriptional as well as chromatin accessibility trajectories, indicating that gradual changes in the chromatin accessibility landscape are lagging behind the transcriptional identity of hair cells along the organ's longitudinal axis. Overall, this study provides a strategy to spatially reconstruct the formation of a lineage-specific regulatory landscape using a single-cell multi-omics approach.

35544276	2022	Nucleic acids research	Definition of germ layer cell lineage alternative splicing programs reveals a critical role for Quaking in specifying cardiac cell fate.	Alternative splicing is critical for development; however, its role in the specification of the three embryonic germ layers is poorly understood. By performing RNA-Seq on human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and derived definitive endoderm, cardiac mesoderm, and ectoderm cell lineages, we detect distinct alternative splicing programs associated with each lineage. The most prominent splicing program differences are observed between definitive endoderm and cardiac mesoderm. Integrative multi-omics analyses link each program with lineage-enriched RNA binding protein regulators, and further suggest a widespread role for Quaking (QKI) in the specification of cardiac mesoderm. Remarkably, knockout of QKI disrupts the cardiac mesoderm-associated alternative splicing program and formation of myocytes. These changes arise in part through reduced expression of BIN1 splice variants linked to cardiac development. Mechanistically, we find that QKI represses inclusion of exon 7 in BIN1 pre-mRNA via an exonic ACUAA motif, and this is concomitant with intron removal and cleavage from chromatin. Collectively, our results uncover alternative splicing programs associated with the three germ lineages and demonstrate an important role for QKI in the formation of cardiac mesoderm.
40825238	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Reg2ST: recognizing potential patterns from gene expression for spatial transcriptomics prediction.	Spatial transcriptomics is able to acquire cellular gene expression while retaining spatial location. It is often accompanied by matched hematoxylin and eosin-stained histology whole-slide images. This retention of spatial information is critical for studying key issues in cell biology, developmental biology, neurobiology, and tumor biology. However, conventional sequencing technologies are costly and time-consuming, limiting the development of spatial transcriptomics research. Recently, deep learning methods have been widely applied to spatial transcriptomics prediction, but there are some problems in existing methods. To tackle the problem, we develop Reg2ST, a deep learning model to learn potential patterns in gene expression and apply them for spatial transcriptomics prediction. Reg2ST treats spatial transcriptomics and histology as different expressions of the same data. Contrastive learning is used to minimize the distance between them. Then image features are used to predict gene features, which aligns histology images with spatial transcriptomics. Reg2ST uses a novel way to capture relationships among spots instead of K-Nearest-Neighbors. Evaluations of Pearson correlation coefficient, statistical tests, computational efficiency using human breast cancer, and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma datasets demonstrate the superior performance of Reg2ST for spatial gene expression prediction.
36882008	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Integrative analysis of multi-omics and imaging data with incorporation of biological information via structural Bayesian factor analysis.	MOTIVATION: With the rapid development of modern technologies, massive data are available for the systematic study of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Though many existing AD studies mainly focus on single-modality omics data, multi-omics datasets can provide a more comprehensive understanding of AD. To bridge this gap, we proposed a novel structural Bayesian factor analysis framework (SBFA) to extract the information shared by multi-omics data through the aggregation of genotyping data, gene expression data, neuroimaging phenotypes and prior biological network knowledge. Our approach can extract common information shared by different modalities and encourage biologically related features to be selected, guiding future AD research in a biologically meaningful way. METHOD: Our SBFA model decomposes the mean parameters of the data into a sparse factor loading matrix and a factor matrix, where the factor matrix represents the common information extracted from multi-omics and imaging data. Our framework is designed to incorporate prior biological network information. Our simulation study demonstrated that our proposed SBFA framework could achieve the best performance compared with the other state-of-the-art factor-analysis-based integrative analysis methods. RESULTS: We apply our proposed SBFA model together with several state-of-the-art factor analysis models to extract the latent common information from genotyping, gene expression and brain imaging data simultaneously from the ADNI biobank database. The latent information is then used to predict the functional activities questionnaire score, an important measurement for diagnosis of AD quantifying subjects' abilities in daily life. Our SBFA model shows the best prediction performance compared with the other factor analysis models. AVAILABILITY: Code are publicly available at https://github.com/JingxuanBao/SBFA.

34035045	2021	Genome research	Characterizing spatial gene expression heterogeneity in spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomic data with nonuniform cellular densities.	Recent technological advances have enabled spatially resolved measurements of expression profiles for hundreds to thousands of genes in fixed tissues at single-cell resolution. However, scalable computational analysis methods able to take into consideration the inherent 3D spatial organization of cell types and nonuniform cellular densities within tissues are still lacking. To address this, we developed MERINGUE, a computational framework based on spatial autocorrelation and cross-correlation analysis to identify genes with spatially heterogeneous expression patterns, infer putative cell-cell communication, and perform spatially informed cell clustering in 2D and 3D in a density-agnostic manner using spatially resolved transcriptomic data. We applied MERINGUE to a variety of spatially resolved transcriptomic data sets including multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH), spatial transcriptomics, Slide-seq, and aligned in situ hybridization (ISH) data. We anticipate that such statistical analysis of spatially resolved transcriptomic data will facilitate our understanding of the interplay between cell state and spatial organization in tissue development and disease.
36929930	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scMCs: a framework for single-cell multi-omics data integration and multiple clusterings.	MOTIVATION: The integration of single-cell multi-omics data can uncover the underlying regulatory basis of diverse cell types and states. However, contemporary methods disregard the omics individuality, and the high noise, sparsity, and heterogeneity of single-cell data also impact the fusion effect. Furthermore, available single-cell clustering methods only focus on the cell type clustering, which cannot mine the alternative clustering to comprehensively analyze cells. RESULTS: We propose a single-cell data fusion based multiple clustering (scMCs) approach that can jointly model single-cell transcriptomics and epigenetic data, and explore multiple different clusterings. scMCs first mines the omics-specific and cross-omics consistent representations, then fuses them into a co-embedding representation, which can dissect cellular heterogeneity and impute data. To discover the potential alternative clustering embedded in multi-omics, scMCs projects the co-embedding representation into different salient subspaces. Meanwhile, it reduces the redundancy between subspaces to enhance the diversity of alternative clusterings and optimizes the cluster centers in each subspace to boost the quality of corresponding clustering. Unlike single clustering, these alternative clusterings provide additional perspectives for understanding complex genetic information, such as cell types and states. Experimental results show that scMCs can effectively identify subcellular types, impute dropout events, and uncover diverse cell characteristics by giving different but meaningful clusterings. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The code is available at www.sdu-idea.cn/codes.php?name=scMCs.
36864198	2023	Nature methods	Designing spatial transcriptomic experiments.	
36702899	2023	Nature biotechnology	Spatial transcriptomics for profiling the tropism of viral vectors in tissues.	A barrier to advancing engineered adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) for precision access to cell subtypes is a lack of high-throughput, high-resolution assays to characterize in vivo transduction profiles. In this study, we developed an ultrasensitive, sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization (USeqFISH) method for spatial transcriptomic profiling of endogenous and viral RNA with a short barcode in intact tissue volumes by integrating hydrogel-based tissue clearing, enhanced signal amplification and multiplexing using sequential labeling. Using USeqFISH, we investigated the transduction and cell subtype tropisms across mouse brain regions of six systemic AAVs, including AAV-PHP.AX, a new variant that transduces robustly and efficiently across neurons and astrocytes. Here we reveal distinct cell subtype biases of each AAV variant, including a bias of AAV-PHP.N toward excitatory neurons. USeqFISH also enables profiling of pooled regulatory cargos, as we show for a 13-variant pool of microRNA target sites in AAV genomes. Lastly, we demonstrate potential applications of USeqFISH for in situ AAV profiling and multimodal single-cell analysis in non-human primates.
40981522	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	CLUEY enables knowledge-guided clustering and cell type detection from single-cell omics data.	MOTIVATION: Clustering is a fundamental task in single-cell omics data analysis and can significantly impact downstream analyses and biological interpretations. The standard approach involves grouping cells based on their gene expression profiles, followed by annotating each cluster to a cell type using marker genes. However, the number of cell types detected by different clustering methods can vary substantially due to several factors, including the dimension reduction method used and the choice of parameters of the chosen clustering algorithm. These discrepancies can lead to subjective interpretations in downstream analyses, particularly in manual cell type annotation. RESULTS: To address these challenges, we propose CLUEY, a knowledge-guided framework for cell type detection and clustering of single-cell omics data. CLUEY integrates prior biological knowledge into the clustering process, providing guidance on the optimal number of clusters and enhancing the interpretability of results. We apply CLUEY to both unimodal (e.g. scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq) and multimodal datasets (e.g. CITE-seq, SHARE-seq) and demonstrate its effectiveness in providing biologically meaningful clustering outcomes. These results highlight CLUEY on providing the much-needed guidance in clustering analyses of single-cell omics data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: CLUEY package is freely available from https://github.com/SydneyBioX/CLUEY.
34061840	2021	PLoS computational biology	TSCCA: A tensor sparse CCA method for detecting microRNA-gene patterns from multiple cancers.	Existing studies have demonstrated that dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) is involved in the initiation and progression of cancer. Many efforts have been devoted to identify microRNAs as potential biomarkers for cancer diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic targets. With the rapid development of miRNA sequencing technology, a vast amount of miRNA expression data for multiple cancers has been collected. These invaluable data repositories provide new paradigms to explore the relationship between miRNAs and cancer. Thus, there is an urgent need to explore the complex cancer-related miRNA-gene patterns by integrating multi-omics data in a pan-cancer paradigm. In this study, we present a tensor sparse canonical correlation analysis (TSCCA) method for identifying cancer-related miRNA-gene modules across multiple cancers. TSCCA is able to overcome the drawbacks of existing solutions and capture both the cancer-shared and specific miRNA-gene co-expressed modules with better biological interpretations. We comprehensively evaluate the performance of TSCCA using a set of simulated data and matched miRNA/gene expression data across 33 cancer types from the TCGA database. We uncover several dysfunctional miRNA-gene modules with important biological functions and statistical significance. These modules can advance our understanding of miRNA regulatory mechanisms of cancer and provide insights into miRNA-based treatments for cancer.
39394480	2025	Nature biotechnology	A comprehensive proteogenomic pipeline for neoantigen discovery to advance personalized cancer immunotherapy.	The accurate identification and prioritization of antigenic peptides is crucial for the development of personalized cancer immunotherapies. Publicly available pipelines to predict clinical neoantigens do not allow direct integration of mass spectrometry immunopeptidomics data, which can uncover antigenic peptides derived from various canonical and noncanonical sources. To address this, we present an end-to-end clinical proteogenomic pipeline, called NeoDisc, that combines state-of-the-art publicly available and in-house software for immunopeptidomics, genomics and transcriptomics with in silico tools for the identification, prediction and prioritization of tumor-specific and immunogenic antigens from multiple sources, including neoantigens, viral antigens, high-confidence tumor-specific antigens and tumor-specific noncanonical antigens. We demonstrate the superiority of NeoDisc in accurately prioritizing immunogenic neoantigens over recent prioritization pipelines. We showcase the various features offered by NeoDisc that enable both rule-based and machine-learning approaches for personalized antigen discovery and neoantigen cancer vaccine design. Additionally, we demonstrate how NeoDisc's multiomics integration identifies defects in the cellular antigen presentation machinery, which influence the heterogeneous tumor antigenic landscape.
40057378	2025	Nucleic acids research	stAI: a deep learning-based model for missing gene imputation and cell-type annotation of spatial transcriptomics.	Spatial transcriptomics technology has revolutionized our understanding of cellular systems by capturing RNA transcript levels in their original spatial context. Single-cell spatial transcriptomics (scST) offers single-cell resolution expression level and precise spatial information of RNA transcripts, while it has a limited capacity for simultaneously detecting a wide range of RNA transcripts, hindering its broader applications. Characterizing the whole transcriptome level and comprehensively annotating cell types represent two significant challenges in scST applications. Despite several proposed methods for one or both tasks, their performance remains inadequate. In this work, we introduce stAI, a deep learning-based model designed to address both missing gene imputation and cell-type annotation for scST data. stAI leverages a joint embedding for the scST and the reference scRNA-seq data with two separate encoder-decoder modules. Both the imputation and annotation are performed within the latent space in a supervised manner, utilizing scRNA-seq data to guide the processes. Experiments for datasets generated from diverse platforms with varying numbers of measured genes were conducted and compared with the updated methods. The results demonstrate that stAI can predict the unmeasured genes, especially the marker genes, with much higher accuracy, and annotate the cell types, including those of small size, with high precision.
37930845	2024	Nucleic acids research	jMorp: Japanese Multi-Omics Reference Panel update report 2023.	Modern medicine is increasingly focused on personalized medicine, and multi-omics data is crucial in understanding biological phenomena and disease mechanisms. Each ethnic group has its unique genetic background with specific genomic variations influencing disease risk and drug response. Therefore, multi-omics data from specific ethnic populations are essential for the effective implementation of personalized medicine. Various prospective cohort studies, such as the UK Biobank, All of Us and Lifelines, have been conducted worldwide. The Tohoku Medical Megabank project was initiated after the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011. It collects biological specimens and conducts genome and omics analyses to build a basis for personalized medicine. Summary statistical data from these analyses are available in the jMorp web database (https://jmorp.megabank.tohoku.ac.jp), which provides a multidimensional approach to the diversity of the Japanese population. jMorp was launched in 2015 as a public database for plasma metabolome and proteome analyses and has been continuously updated. The current update will significantly expand the scale of the data (metabolome, genome, transcriptome, and metagenome). In addition, the user interface and backend server implementations were rewritten to improve the connectivity between the items stored in jMorp. This paper provides an overview of the new version of the jMorp.
39888860	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scatterbar: an R package for visualizing proportional data across spatially resolved coordinates.	MOTIVATION: Displaying proportional data across many spatially resolved coordinates is a challenging but important data visualization task, particularly for spatially resolved transcriptomics data. Scatter pie plots are one type of commonly used data visualization for such data but present perceptual challenges that may lead to difficulties in interpretation. Increasing the visual saliency of such data visualizations can help viewers more accurately identify proportional trends and compare proportional differences across spatial locations. RESULTS: We developed scatterbar, an open-source R package that extends ggplot2, to visualize proportional data across many spatially resolved coordinates using scatter stacked bar plots. We apply scatterbar to visualize deconvolved cell-type proportions from a spatial transcriptomics dataset of the adult mouse brain to demonstrate how scatter stacked bar plots can enhance the distinguishability of proportional distributions compared to scatter pie plots. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: scatterbar is available on CRAN https://cran.r-project.org/package=scatterbar with additional documentation and tutorials at https://jef.works/scatterbar/.
37679545	2024	Nature biotechnology	Quartet RNA reference materials improve the quality of transcriptomic data through ratio-based profiling.	Certified RNA reference materials are indispensable for assessing the reliability of RNA sequencing to detect intrinsically small biological differences in clinical settings, such as molecular subtyping of diseases. As part of the Quartet Project for quality control and data integration of multi-omics profiling, we established four RNA reference materials derived from immortalized B-lymphoblastoid cell lines from four members of a monozygotic twin family. Additionally, we constructed ratio-based transcriptome-wide reference datasets between two samples, providing cross-platform and cross-laboratory 'ground truth'. Investigation of the intrinsically subtle biological differences among the Quartet samples enables sensitive assessment of cross-batch integration of transcriptomic measurements at the ratio level. The Quartet RNA reference materials, combined with the ratio-based reference datasets, can serve as unique resources for assessing and improving the quality of transcriptomic data in clinical and biological settings.
39623485	2024	Genome biology	SMART: spatial transcriptomics deconvolution using marker-gene-assisted topic model.	While spatial transcriptomics offer valuable insights into gene expression patterns within the spatial context of tissue, many technologies do not have a single-cell resolution. Here, we present SMART, a marker gene-assisted deconvolution method that simultaneously infers the cell type-specific gene expression profile and the cellular composition at each spot. Using multiple datasets, we show that SMART outperforms the existing methods in realistic settings. It also provides a two-stage approach to enhance its performance on cell subtypes. The covariate model of SMART enables the identification of cell type-specific differentially expressed genes across conditions, elucidating biological changes at a single-cell-type resolution.
39230711	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Graspot: a graph attention network for spatial transcriptomics data integration with optimal transport.	SUMMARY: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies enable the measurement of mRNA expression while simultaneously capturing spot locations. By integrating ST data, the 3D structure of a tissue can be reconstructed, yielding a comprehensive understanding of the tissue's intricacies. Nevertheless, a computational challenge persists: how to remove batch effects while preserving genuine biological structure variations across ST data. To address this, we introduce Graspot, a graph attention network designed for spatial transcriptomics data integration with unbalanced optimal transport. Graspot adeptly harnesses both gene expression and spatial information to align common structures across multiple ST datasets. It embeds multiple ST datasets into a unified latent space, facilitating the partial alignment of spots from different slices. Demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods on four real ST datasets, Graspot excels in ST data integration, including tasks that require partial alignment. In particular, Graspot efficiently integrates multiple ST slices and guides coordinate alignment. In addition, Graspot accurately aligns the spatio-temporal transcriptomics data to reconstruct human heart developmental processes. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Graspot software is available at https://github.com/zhan009/Graspot.
38129866	2023	Genome biology	ENGEP: advancing spatial transcriptomics with accurate unmeasured gene expression prediction.	Imaging-based spatial transcriptomics techniques provide valuable spatial and gene expression information at single-cell resolution. However, their current capability is restricted to profiling a limited number of genes per sample, resulting in most of the transcriptome remaining unmeasured. To overcome this challenge, we develop ENGEP, an ensemble learning-based tool that predicts unmeasured gene expression in spatial transcriptomics data by using multiple single-cell RNA sequencing datasets as references. ENGEP outperforms current state-of-the-art tools and brings biological insight by accurately predicting unmeasured genes. ENGEP has exceptional efficiency in terms of runtime and memory usage, making it scalable for analyzing large datasets.
33341877	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	PharmKG: a dedicated knowledge graph benchmark for bomedical data mining.	Biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs), which can help with the understanding of complex biological systems and pathologies, have begun to play a critical role in medical practice and research. However, challenges remain in their embedding and use due to their complex nature and the specific demands of their construction. Existing studies often suffer from problems such as sparse and noisy datasets, insufficient modeling methods and non-uniform evaluation metrics. In this work, we established a comprehensive KG system for the biomedical field in an attempt to bridge the gap. Here, we introduced PharmKG, a multi-relational, attributed biomedical KG, composed of more than 500 000 individual interconnections between genes, drugs and diseases, with 29 relation types over a vocabulary of ~8000 disambiguated entities. Each entity in PharmKG is attached with heterogeneous, domain-specific information obtained from multi-omics data, i.e. gene expression, chemical structure and disease word embedding, while preserving the semantic and biomedical features. For baselines, we offered nine state-of-the-art KG embedding (KGE) approaches and a new biological, intuitive, graph neural network-based KGE method that uses a combination of both global network structure and heterogeneous domain features. Based on the proposed benchmark, we conducted extensive experiments to assess these KGE models using multiple evaluation metrics. Finally, we discussed our observations across various downstream biological tasks and provide insights and guidelines for how to use a KG in biomedicine. We hope that the unprecedented quality and diversity of PharmKG will lead to advances in biomedical KG construction, embedding and application.
32449936	2020	Nucleic acids research	CVCDAP: an integrated platform for molecular and clinical analysis of cancer virtual cohorts.	Recent large-scale multi-omics studies resulted in quick accumulation of an overwhelming amount of cancer-related data, which provides an unprecedented resource to interrogate diverse questions. While certain existing web servers are valuable and widely used, analysis and visualization functions with regard to re-investigation of these data at cohort level are not adequately addressed. Here, we present CVCDAP, a web-based platform to deliver an interactive and customizable toolbox off the shelf for cohort-level analysis of TCGA and CPTAC public datasets, as well as user uploaded datasets. CVCDAP allows flexible selection of patients sharing common molecular and/or clinical characteristics across multiple studies as a virtual cohort, and provides dozens of built-in customizable tools for seamless genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and clinical analysis of a single virtual cohort, as well as, to compare two virtual cohorts with relevance. The flexibility and analytic competence of CVCDAP empower experimental and clinical researchers to identify new molecular mechanisms and develop potential therapeutic approaches, by building and analyzing virtual cohorts for their subject of interests. We demonstrate that CVCDAP can conveniently reproduce published findings and reveal novel insights by two applications. The CVCDAP web server is freely available at https://omics.bjcancer.org/cvcdap/.
36857617	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	STEEL enables high-resolution delineation of spatiotemporal transcriptomic data.	Advances in spatial transcriptomics enlarge the use of single cell technologies to unveil the expression landscape of the tissues with valuable spatial context. Here, we propose an unsupervised and manifold learning-based algorithm, Spatial Transcriptome based cEll typE cLustering (STEEL), which identifies domains from spatial transcriptome by clustering beads exhibiting both highly similar gene expression profiles and close spatial distance in the manner of graphs. Comprehensive evaluation of STEEL on spatial transcriptomic datasets from 10X Visium platform demonstrates that it not only achieves a high resolution to characterize fine structures of mouse brain but also enables the integration of multiple tissue slides individually analyzed into a larger one. STEEL outperforms previous methods to effectively distinguish different cell types/domains of various tissues on Slide-seq datasets, featuring in higher bead density but lower transcript detection efficiency. Application of STEEL on spatial transcriptomes of early-stage mouse embryos (E9.5-E12.5) successfully delineates a progressive development landscape of tissues from ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm layers, and further profiles dynamic changes on cell differentiation in heart and other organs. With the advancement of spatial transcriptome technologies, our method will have great applicability on domain identification and gene expression atlas reconstruction.
39406522	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	A multi-omics study of brain tissue transcription and DNA methylation revealing the genetic pathogenesis of ADHD.	Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a chronic psychiatric disease that often affects a patient's whole life. Research has found that genetics plays an important role in the development of ADHD. However, there is still a lack of knowledge about the tissue-specific causal effects of biological processes beyond gene expression, such as alternative splicing (AS) and DNA methylation (DNAm), on ADHD. In this paper, a multi-omics study was conducted to investigate the causal effects of the transcription and the DNAm on ADHD, by integrating ADHD genome-wide association data with quantitative trait loci data of gene expression, AS, and DNAm across 14 different brain tissues. The causal effects were estimated using four different two-sample Mendelian randomization methods. Finally, we also prioritized the expression of 866 genes showing significant causal effects, including COMMD5, ENSG00000271904, HYAL3, etc., within at least one brain tissue. We prioritized 966 unique genes that have statistically significant causal AS events, within at least one of the 14 different brain tissues. These genes include PPP1R16A, GGT7, TREM2, etc. Furthermore, through mediation analysis, 106 regulatory pathways were inferred where DNAm influences ADHD through gene expression or AS processes. Our research findings provide guidance for future experimental studies on the molecular mechanisms of ADHD development, and also put forward valuable knowledge for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of ADHD.

36653906	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	DIST: spatial transcriptomics enhancement using deep learning.	Spatially resolved transcriptomics technologies enable comprehensive measurement of gene expression patterns in the context of intact tissues. However, existing technologies suffer from either low resolution or shallow sequencing depth. Here, we present DIST, a deep learning-based method that imputes the gene expression profiles on unmeasured locations and enhances the gene expression for both original measured spots and imputed spots by self-supervised learning and transfer learning. We evaluate the performance of DIST for imputation, clustering, differential expression analysis and functional enrichment analysis. The results show that DIST can impute the gene expression accurately, enhance the gene expression for low-quality data, help detect more biological meaningful differentially expressed genes and pathways, therefore allow for deeper insights into the biological processes.
38628114	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	stDiff: a diffusion model for imputing spatial transcriptomics through single-cell transcriptomics.	Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has become a powerful tool for exploring the spatial organization of gene expression in tissues. Imaging-based methods, though offering superior spatial resolutions at the single-cell level, are limited in either the number of imaged genes or the sensitivity of gene detection. Existing approaches for enhancing ST rely on the similarity between ST cells and reference single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) cells. In contrast, we introduce stDiff, which leverages relationships between gene expression abundance in scRNA-seq data to enhance ST. stDiff employs a conditional diffusion model, capturing gene expression abundance relationships in scRNA-seq data through two Markov processes: one introducing noise to transcriptomics data and the other denoising to recover them. The missing portion of ST is predicted by incorporating the original ST data into the denoising process. In our comprehensive performance evaluation across 16 datasets, utilizing multiple clustering and similarity metrics, stDiff stands out for its exceptional ability to preserve topological structures among cells, positioning itself as a robust solution for cell population identification. Moreover, stDiff's enhancement outcomes closely mirror the actual ST data within the batch space. Across diverse spatial expression patterns, our model accurately reconstructs them, delineating distinct spatial boundaries. This highlights stDiff's capability to unify the observed and predicted segments of ST data for subsequent analysis. We anticipate that stDiff, with its innovative approach, will contribute to advancing ST imputation methodologies.
39228303	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	ST-SCSR: identifying spatial domains in spatial transcriptomics data via structure correlation and self-representation.	Recent advances in spatial transcriptomics (ST) enable measurements of transcriptome within intact biological tissues by preserving spatial information, offering biologists unprecedented opportunities to comprehensively understand tissue micro-environment, where spatial domains are basic units of tissues. Although great efforts are devoted to this issue, they still have many shortcomings, such as ignoring local information and relations of spatial domains, requiring alternatives to solve these problems. Here, a novel algorithm for spatial domain identification in Spatial Transcriptomics data with Structure Correlation and Self-Representation (ST-SCSR), which integrates local information, global information, and similarity of spatial domains. Specifically, ST-SCSR utilzes matrix tri-factorization to simultaneously decompose expression profiles and spatial network of spots, where expressional and spatial features of spots are fused via the shared factor matrix that interpreted as similarity of spatial domains. Furthermore, ST-SCSR learns affinity graph of spots by manipulating expressional and spatial features, where local preservation and sparse constraints are employed, thereby enhancing the quality of graph. The experimental results demonstrate that ST-SCSR not only outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy, but also identifies many potential interesting patterns.
33119753	2021	Nucleic acids research	Aging Atlas: a multi-omics database for aging biology.	Organismal aging is driven by interconnected molecular changes encompassing internal and extracellular factors. Combinational analysis of high-throughput 'multi-omics' datasets (gathering information from genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and pharmacogenomics), at either populational or single-cell levels, can provide a multi-dimensional, integrated profile of the heterogeneous aging process with unprecedented throughput and detail. These new strategies allow for the exploration of the molecular profile and regulatory status of gene expression during aging, and in turn, facilitate the development of new aging interventions. With a continually growing volume of valuable aging-related data, it is necessary to establish an open and integrated database to support a wide spectrum of aging research. The Aging Atlas database aims to provide a wide range of life science researchers with valuable resources that allow access to a large-scale of gene expression and regulation datasets created by various high-throughput omics technologies. The current implementation includes five modules: transcriptomics (RNA-seq), single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq), epigenomics (ChIP-seq), proteomics (protein-protein interaction), and pharmacogenomics (geroprotective compounds). Aging Atlas provides user-friendly functionalities to explore age-related changes in gene expression, as well as raw data download services. Aging Atlas is freely available at https://bigd.big.ac.cn/aging/index.
39581873	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	VGAE-CCI: variational graph autoencoder-based construction of 3D spatial cell-cell communication network.	Cell-cell communication plays a critical role in maintaining normal biological functions, regulating development and differentiation, and controlling immune responses. The rapid development of single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics sequencing (ST-seq) technologies provides essential data support for in-depth and comprehensive analysis of cell-cell communication. However, ST-seq data often contain incomplete data and systematic biases, which may reduce the accuracy and reliability of predicting cell-cell communication. Furthermore, other methods for analyzing cell-cell communication mainly focus on individual tissue sections, neglecting cell-cell communication across multiple tissue layers, and fail to comprehensively elucidate cell-cell communication networks within three-dimensional tissues. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose VGAE-CCI, a deep learning framework based on the Variational Graph Autoencoder, capable of identifying cell-cell communication across multiple tissue layers. Additionally, this model can be applied to spatial transcriptomics data with missing or partially incomplete data and can clustered cells at single-cell resolution based on spatial encoding information within complex tissues, thereby enabling more accurate inference of cell-cell communication. Finally, we tested our method on six datasets and compared it with other state of art methods for predicting cell-cell communication. Our method outperformed other methods across multiple metrics, demonstrating its efficiency and reliability in predicting cell-cell communication.
40199763	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	ROICellTrack: a deep learning framework for integrating cellular imaging modalities in subcellular spatial transcriptomic profiling of tumor tissues.	MOTIVATION: Spatial transcriptomic (ST) technologies, such as GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler, are increasingly utilized to investigate the role of diverse tumor microenvironment components, particularly in relation to cancer progression, treatment response, and therapeutic resistance. However, in many ST studies, the spatial information obtained from immunofluorescence imaging is primarily used for identifying regions of interest (ROIs) rather than as an integral part of downstream transcriptomic data analysis and interpretation. RESULTS: We developed ROICellTrack, a deep learning-based framework that better integrates cellular imaging with spatial transcriptomic profiling. By analyzing 56 ROIs from urothelial carcinoma of the bladder and upper tract urothelial carcinoma, ROICellTrack identified distinct cancer-immune cell mixtures, characterized by specific transcriptomic and morphological signatures and receptor-ligand interactions linked to tumor content and immune infiltrations. Our findings demonstrate the value of integrating imaging with transcriptomics to analyze spatial omics data, improving our understanding of tumor heterogeneity and its relevance to personalized and targeted therapies. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: ROICellTrack is publicly available at https://github.com/wanglab1/ROICellTrack.
35577954	2022	Nature methods	Benchmarking spatial and single-cell transcriptomics integration methods for transcript distribution prediction and cell type deconvolution.	Spatial transcriptomics approaches have substantially advanced our capacity to detect the spatial distribution of RNA transcripts in tissues, yet it remains challenging to characterize whole-transcriptome-level data for single cells in space. Addressing this need, researchers have developed integration methods to combine spatial transcriptomic data with single-cell RNA-seq data to predict the spatial distribution of undetected transcripts and/or perform cell type deconvolution of spots in histological sections. However, to date, no independent studies have comparatively analyzed these integration methods to benchmark their performance. Here we present benchmarking of 16 integration methods using 45 paired datasets (comprising both spatial transcriptomics and scRNA-seq data) and 32 simulated datasets. We found that Tangram, gimVI, and SpaGE outperformed other integration methods for predicting the spatial distribution of RNA transcripts, whereas Cell2location, SpatialDWLS, and RCTD are the top-performing methods for the cell type deconvolution of spots. We provide a benchmark pipeline to help researchers select optimal integration methods to process their datasets.
32657371	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	AITL: Adversarial Inductive Transfer Learning with input and output space adaptation for pharmacogenomics.	MOTIVATION: The goal of pharmacogenomics is to predict drug response in patients using their single- or multi-omics data. A major challenge is that clinical data (i.e. patients) with drug response outcome is very limited, creating a need for transfer learning to bridge the gap between large pre-clinical pharmacogenomics datasets (e.g. cancer cell lines), as a source domain, and clinical datasets as a target domain. Two major discrepancies exist between pre-clinical and clinical datasets: (i) in the input space, the gene expression data due to difference in the basic biology, and (ii) in the output space, the different measures of the drug response. Therefore, training a computational model on cell lines and testing it on patients violates the i.i.d assumption that train and test data are from the same distribution. RESULTS: We propose Adversarial Inductive Transfer Learning (AITL), a deep neural network method for addressing discrepancies in input and output space between the pre-clinical and clinical datasets. AITL takes gene expression of patients and cell lines as the input, employs adversarial domain adaptation and multi-task learning to address these discrepancies, and predicts the drug response as the output. To the best of our knowledge, AITL is the first adversarial inductive transfer learning method to address both input and output discrepancies. Experimental results indicate that AITL outperforms state-of-the-art pharmacogenomics and transfer learning baselines and may guide precision oncology more accurately. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: https://github.com/hosseinshn/AITL. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
26773059	2016	Nucleic acids research	Integration of multi-omics data of a genome-reduced bacterium: Prevalence of post-transcriptional regulation and its correlation with protein abundances.	We developed a comprehensive resource for the genome-reduced bacterium Mycoplasma pneumoniae comprising 1748 consistently generated '-omics' data sets, and used it to quantify the power of antisense non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), lysine acetylation, and protein phosphorylation in predicting protein abundance (11%, 24% and 8%, respectively). These factors taken together are four times more predictive of the proteome abundance than of mRNA abundance. In bacteria, post-translational modifications (PTMs) and ncRNA transcription were both found to increase with decreasing genomic GC-content and genome size. Thus, the evolutionary forces constraining genome size and GC-content modify the relative contributions of the different regulatory layers to proteome homeostasis, and impact more genomic and genetic features than previously appreciated. Indeed, these scaling principles will enable us to develop more informed approaches when engineering minimal synthetic genomes.
36624212	2023	Nature methods	Robust single-cell matching and multimodal analysis using shared and distinct features.	The ability to align individual cellular information from multiple experimental sources is fundamental for a systems-level understanding of biological processes. However, currently available tools are mainly designed for single-cell transcriptomics matching and integration, and generally rely on a large number of shared features across datasets for cell matching. This approach underperforms when applied to single-cell proteomic datasets due to the limited number of parameters simultaneously accessed and lack of shared markers across these experiments. Here, we introduce a cell-matching algorithm, matching with partial overlap (MARIO) that accounts for both shared and distinct features, while consisting of vital filtering steps to avoid suboptimal matching. MARIO accurately matches and integrates data from different single-cell proteomic and multimodal methods, including spatial techniques and has cross-species capabilities. MARIO robustly matched tissue macrophages identified from COVID-19 lung autopsies via codetection by indexing imaging to macrophages recovered from COVID-19 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid by cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing, revealing unique immune responses within the lung microenvironment of patients with COVID.
40262896	2025	Genome research	Dissecting multilayer cell-cell communications with signaling feedback loops from spatial transcriptomics data.	The emergence of spatial transcriptomics (ST) provides unprecedented opportunities to better decipher cell-cell communication (CCC). How to integrate spatial information and complex signaling mechanisms to infer functional CCC, however, remains a major challenge. Here, we present stMLnet, a method that takes into account spatial information and multilayer signaling regulation to identify signaling feedback loops within multilayer CCCs from ST data. To this end, stMLnet quantifies spatially dependent ligand-receptor signaling activity based on diffusion and mass action models, and maps it to intracellular targets. We benchmark stMLnet against seven representative methods and find that stMLnet performs better in both intercellular ligand-receptor inference and intracellular target gene prediction. We apply stMLnet to analyze data from diverse ST techniques like seqFISH+, Slide-seq v2, MERFISH, and Stereo-seq, verifying its robustness and scalability on ST data with varying spatial resolutions and gene coverages. Particularly, stMLnet reveals multilayer signaling feedback loops underlying the inflammatory response in ST data of COVID-19-infected lung tissue. Our study provides an effective tool for dissecting multilayer ligand/receptor-target regulation and multicellular signaling circuits from ST data, which can advance understanding of the mechanistic and functional roles of spatial CCC.
39639369	2024	Genome biology	Increased spatial coupling of integrin and collagen IV in the immunoresistant clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma tumor microenvironment.	BACKGROUND: Immunotherapy has improved survival for patients with advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), but resistance to therapy develops in most patients. We use cellular-resolution spatial transcriptomics in patients with immunotherapy naive and exposed primary ccRCC tumors to better understand immunotherapy resistance. RESULTS: Spatial molecular imaging of tumor and adjacent stroma samples from 21 tumors suggests that viable tumors following immunotherapy harbor more stromal CD8 + T cells and neutrophils than immunotherapy naive tumors. YES1 is significantly upregulated in immunotherapy exposed tumor cells. Spatial GSEA shows that the epithelial-mesenchymal transition pathway is spatially enriched and the associated ligand-receptor transcript pair COL4A1-ITGAV has significantly higher autocorrelation in the stroma after exposure to immunotherapy. More integrin alphaV + cells are observed in immunotherapy exposed stroma on multiplex immunofluorescence validation. Compared to other cancers in TCGA, ccRCC tumors have the highest expression of both COL4A1 and ITGAV. Assessing bulk RNA expression and proteomic correlates in CPTAC databases reveals that collagen IV protein is more abundant in advanced stages of disease. CONCLUSIONS: Spatial transcriptomics of samples of 3 patient cohorts with cRCC tumors indicates that COL4A1 and ITGAV are more autocorrelated in immunotherapy-exposed stroma compared to immunotherapy-naive tumors, with high expression among fibroblasts, tumor cells, and endothelium. Further research is needed to understand changes in the ccRCC tumor immune microenvironment and explore potential therapeutic role of integrin after immunotherapy treatment.
40366019	2025	Nucleic acids research	CausalCCC: a web server to explore intracellular causal pathways enabling cell-cell communication.	Understanding cell-cell communication (CCC) pathways from single-cell or spatial transcriptomic data is key to unraveling biological processes. Recently, multiple CCC methods have been developed but primarily focus on refining ligand-receptor (L-R) interaction scores. A critical gap for a more comprehensive picture of cellular crosstalks lies in the integration of upstream and downstream intracellular pathways in the sender and receiver cells. We report here CausalCCC, https://miic.curie.fr/causalCCC.php, an interactive web server, which addresses this need by reconstructing gene-gene interaction pathways across two or more interacting cell types from single-cell or spatial transcriptomic data. CausalCCC includes a graphical introduction and a demo dataset within the workbench page as well as a comprehensive tutorial. CausalCCC methodology integrates a robust and scalable causal network reconstruction method, multivariate information-based inductive causation, with internally computed L-R pairs using LIANA+ (including CellphoneDBv5, SingleCellSignalR, Connectome, NATMI, and Log2FC). Alternatively, user-defined L-R pairs from any CCC methods can also be uploaded. We showcase here CausalCCC on different single-cell and spatial transcriptomic datasets from three original CCC methods (NicheNet, CellChat, and Misty). CausalCCC web server offers unique interactive visualization tools dedicated to single-cell data practitioners seeking to go beyond L-R scores and explore extended CCC pathways across multiple interacting cell types.
40139667	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Benchmarking algorithms for spatially variable gene identification in spatial transcriptomics.	MOTIVATION: The rapid development of spatial transcriptomics has underscored the importance of identifying spatially variable genes. As a fundamental task in spatial transcriptomic data analysis, spatially variable gene identification has been extensively studied. However, the lack of comprehensive benchmark makes it difficult to validate the effectiveness of various algorithms scattered across a large number of studies with real-world datasets. RESULTS: In response, this article proposes a benchmark framework to evaluate algorithms for identifying spatially variable genes through the analysis of 30 synthesized and 74 real-world datasets, aiming to identify the best algorithms and their corresponding application scenarios. This framework can assist medical and life scientists in selecting suitable algorithms for their research, while also aid bioinformatics scientists in developing more powerful and efficient computational methods in spatial transcriptomic research. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code of this benchmarking framework is available at both Github (https://github.com/XiDsLab/svg-benchmark) and Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15031083). In addition, all real and synthetic datasets considered in this study are also publicly available at Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7227771).
33684106	2021	PLoS computational biology	BARcode DEmixing through Non-negative Spatial Regression (BarDensr).	Modern spatial transcriptomics methods can target thousands of different types of RNA transcripts in a single slice of tissue. Many biological applications demand a high spatial density of transcripts relative to the imaging resolution, leading to partial mixing of transcript rolonies in many voxels; unfortunately, current analysis methods do not perform robustly in this highly-mixed setting. Here we develop a new analysis approach, BARcode DEmixing through Non-negative Spatial Regression (BarDensr): we start with a generative model of the physical process that leads to the observed image data and then apply sparse convex optimization methods to estimate the underlying (demixed) rolony densities. We apply BarDensr to simulated and real data and find that it achieves state of the art signal recovery, particularly in densely-labeled regions or data with low spatial resolution. Finally, BarDensr is fast and parallelizable. We provide open-source code as well as an implementation for the 'NeuroCAAS' cloud platform.
40053700	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	ENACT: End-to-End Analysis of Visium High Definition (HD) Data.	MOTIVATION: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) enables the study of gene expression within its spatial context in histopathology samples. To date, a limiting factor has been the resolution of sequencing based ST products. The introduction of the Visium High Definition (HD) technology opens the door to cell resolution ST studies. However, challenges remain in the ability to accurately map transcripts to cells and in assigning cell types based on the transcript data. RESULTS: We developed ENACT, a self-contained pipeline that integrates advanced cell segmentation with Visium HD transcriptomics data to infer cell types across whole tissue sections. Our pipeline incorporates novel bin-to-cell assignment methods, enhancing the accuracy of single-cell transcript estimates. Validated on diverse synthetic and real datasets, our approach is both scalable to samples with hundreds of thousands of cells and effective, offering a robust solution for spatially resolved transcriptomics analysis. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: ENACT source code is available at https://github.com/Sanofi-Public/enact-pipeline. Experimental data are available at https://zenodo.org/records/14748859.
36879008	2023	Nature biotechnology	High-resolution alignment of single-cell and spatial transcriptomes with CytoSPACE.	Recent studies have emphasized the importance of single-cell spatial biology, yet available assays for spatial transcriptomics have limited gene recovery or low spatial resolution. Here we introduce CytoSPACE, an optimization method for mapping individual cells from a single-cell RNA sequencing atlas to spatial expression profiles. Across diverse platforms and tissue types, we show that CytoSPACE outperforms previous methods with respect to noise tolerance and accuracy, enabling tissue cartography at single-cell resolution.
34180954	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	MIMIC: an optimization method to identify cell type-specific marker panel for cell sorting.	Multi-omics data allow us to select a small set of informative markers for the discrimination of specific cell types and study of cellular heterogeneity. However, it is often challenging to choose an optimal marker panel from the high-dimensional molecular profiles for a large amount of cell types. Here, we propose a method called Mixed Integer programming Model to Identify Cell type-specific marker panel (MIMIC). MIMIC maintains the hierarchical topology among different cell types and simultaneously maximizes the specificity of a fixed number of selected markers. MIMIC was benchmarked on the mouse ENCODE RNA-seq dataset, with 29 diverse tissues, for 43 surface markers (SMs) and 1345 transcription factors (TFs). MIMIC could select biologically meaningful markers and is robust for different accuracy criteria. It shows advantages over the standard single gene-based approaches and widely used dimensional reduction methods, such as multidimensional scaling and t-SNE, both in accuracy and in biological interpretation. Furthermore, the combination of SMs and TFs achieves better specificity than SMs or TFs alone. Applying MIMIC to a large collection of 641 RNA-seq samples covering 231 cell types identifies a panel of TFs and SMs that reveal the modularity of cell type association networks. Finally, the scalability of MIMIC is demonstrated by selecting enhancer markers from mouse ENCODE data. MIMIC is freely available at https://github.com/MengZou1/MIMIC.
36515158	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	From multi-omics data to the cancer druggable gene discovery: a novel machine learning-based approach.	The development of targeted drugs allows precision medicine in cancer treatment and optimal targeted therapies. Accurate identification of cancer druggable genes helps strengthen the understanding of targeted cancer therapy and promotes precise cancer treatment. However, rare cancer-druggable genes have been found due to the multi-omics data's diversity and complexity. This study proposes deep forest for cancer druggable genes discovery (DF-CAGE), a novel machine learning-based method for cancer-druggable gene discovery. DF-CAGE integrated the somatic mutations, copy number variants, DNA methylation and RNA-Seq data across  10 000 TCGA profiles to identify the landscape of the cancer-druggable genes. We found that DF-CAGE discovers the commonalities of currently known cancer-druggable genes from the perspective of multi-omics data and achieved excellent performance on OncoKB, Target and Drugbank data sets. Among the  20 000 protein-coding genes, DF-CAGE pinpointed 465 potential cancer-druggable genes. We found that the candidate cancer druggable genes (CDG) are clinically meaningful and divided the CDG into known, reliable and potential gene sets. Finally, we analyzed the omics data's contribution to identifying druggable genes. We found that DF-CAGE reports druggable genes mainly based on the copy number variations (CNVs) data, the gene rearrangements and the mutation rates in the population. These findings may enlighten the future study and development of new drugs.
33381841	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	DeepCDR: a hybrid graph convolutional network for predicting cancer drug response.	MOTIVATION: Accurate prediction of cancer drug response (CDR) is challenging due to the uncertainty of drug efficacy and heterogeneity of cancer patients. Strong evidences have implicated the high dependence of CDR on tumor genomic and transcriptomic profiles of individual patients. Precise identification of CDR is crucial in both guiding anti-cancer drug design and understanding cancer biology. RESULTS: In this study, we present DeepCDR which integrates multi-omics profiles of cancer cells and explores intrinsic chemical structures of drugs for predicting CDR. Specifically, DeepCDR is a hybrid graph convolutional network consisting of a uniform graph convolutional network and multiple subnetworks. Unlike prior studies modeling hand-crafted features of drugs, DeepCDR automatically learns the latent representation of topological structures among atoms and bonds of drugs. Extensive experiments showed that DeepCDR outperformed state-of-the-art methods in both classification and regression settings under various data settings. We also evaluated the contribution of different types of omics profiles for assessing drug response. Furthermore, we provided an exploratory strategy for identifying potential cancer-associated genes concerning specific cancer types. Our results highlighted the predictive power of DeepCDR and its potential translational value in guiding disease-specific drug design. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: DeepCDR is freely available at https://github.com/kimmo1019/DeepCDR. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
30329022	2019	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Integrative cancer patient stratification via subspace merging.	MOTIVATION: Technologies that generate high-throughput omics data are flourishing, creating enormous, publicly available repositories of multi-omics data. As many data repositories continue to grow, there is an urgent need for computational methods that can leverage these data to create comprehensive clusters of patients with a given disease. RESULTS: Our proposed approach creates a patient-to-patient similarity graph for each data type as an intermediate representation of each omics data type and merges the graphs through subspace analysis on a Grassmann manifold. We hypothesize that this approach generates more informative clusters by preserving the complementary information from each level of omics data. We applied our approach to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer dataset and show that by integrating gene expression, microRNA and DNA methylation data, our proposed method can produce clinically useful subtypes of breast cancer. We then investigate the molecular characteristics underlying these subtypes. We discover a highly expressed cluster of genes on chromosome 19p13 that strongly correlates with survival in TCGA breast cancer patients and validate these results in three additional breast cancer datasets. We also compare our approach with previous integrative clustering approaches and obtain comparable or superior results. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: https://github.com/michaelsharpnack/GrassmannCluster. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
36991439	2023	Genome biology	A translatome-transcriptome multi-omics gene regulatory network reveals the complicated functional landscape of maize.	BACKGROUND: Maize (Zea mays L.) is one of the most important crops worldwide. Although sophisticated maize gene regulatory networks (GRNs) have been constructed for functional genomics and phenotypic dissection, a multi-omics GRN connecting the translatome and transcriptome is lacking, hampering our understanding and exploration of the maize regulatome. RESULTS: We collect spatio-temporal translatome and transcriptome data and systematically explore the landscape of gene transcription and translation across 33 tissues or developmental stages of maize. Using this comprehensive transcriptome and translatome atlas, we construct a multi-omics GRN integrating mRNAs and translated mRNAs, demonstrating that translatome-related GRNs outperform GRNs solely using transcriptomic data and inter-omics GRNs outperform intra-omics GRNs in most cases. With the aid of the multi-omics GRN, we reconcile some known regulatory networks. We identify a novel transcription factor, ZmGRF6, which is associated with growth. Furthermore, we characterize a function related to drought response for the classic transcription factor ZmMYB31. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide insights into spatio-temporal changes across maize development at both the transcriptome and translatome levels. Multi-omics GRNs represent a useful resource for dissection of the regulatory mechanisms underlying phenotypic variation.

40424338	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scNucMap: mapping the nucleosome landscapes at single-cell resolution.	MOTIVATION: Nucleosome depletion around cis-regulatory elements (CREs) is associated with CRE activity and implies the underlying gene regulatory network. Single-cell micrococcal nuclease sequencing (scMNase-seq) enables the simultaneous measurement of nucleosome positioning and chromatin accessibility at single-cell resolution, thereby capturing cellular heterogeneity in epigenetic regulation. However, there is currently no computational tool specifically designed to decode scMNase-seq data, impeding the generation of more precise and context-dependent insights into chromatin dynamics and gene regulation. RESULTS: Here, we present scNucMap, a tool designed to leverage the unique characteristics of scMNase-seq data to map the landscapes of candidate nucleosome-free regions (NFRs). scNucMap demonstrated superior performance and robustness in cell clustering on scMNase-seq data compared to Signac and chromVAR across diverse sample compositions and data complexities, achieving higher overall accuracy and Kappa coefficients. Additionally, scNucMap identified significant TFs associated with nucleosome depletion at CREs at both single-cell and cell-cluster levels, thereby facilitating cell-type annotation and regulatory network inference. When applied to scATAC-seq data, scNucMap enriched standard analyses with complementary insights into nucleosome architecture, underscoring its cross‑modality versatility. Overall, scNucMap exhibits both high reliability and adaptability, making it an effective tool for analyzing scMNase-seq data and supporting multimodal studies, thereby illuminating the intricate relationship between regulatory networks and nucleosome positioning at single-cell resolution. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: scNucMap is available at https://github.com/qianming-bioinfo/scNucMap.
41125796	2025	Nature methods	scooby: modeling multimodal genomic profiles from DNA sequence at single-cell resolution.	Understanding how regulatory sequences shape gene expression across individual cells is a fundamental challenge in genomics. Joint RNA sequencing and epigenomic profiling provides opportunities to build models capturing sequence determinants across steps of gene expression. However, current models, developed primarily for bulk omics data, fail to capture the cellular heterogeneity and dynamic processes revealed by single-cell multimodal technologies. Here, we introduce scooby, a framework to model genomic profiles of single-cell RNA-sequencing coverage and single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing insertions from sequence at single-cell resolution. For this, we leverage the pretrained multiomics profile predictor Borzoi and equip it with a cell-specific decoder. Scooby recapitulates cell-specific expression levels of held-out genes and identifies regulators and their putative target genes. Moreover, scooby allows resolving single-cell effects of bulk expression quantitative trait loci and delineating their impact on chromatin accessibility and gene expression. We anticipate scooby to aid unraveling the complexities of gene regulation at the resolution of individual cells.
38837395	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	HE2Gene: image-to-RNA translation via multi-task learning for spatial transcriptomics data.	MOTIVATION: Tissue context and molecular profiling are commonly used measures in understanding normal development and disease pathology. In recent years, the development of spatial molecular profiling technologies (e.g. spatial resolved transcriptomics) has enabled the exploration of quantitative links between tissue morphology and gene expression. However, these technologies remain expensive and time-consuming, with subsequent analyses necessitating high-throughput pathological annotations. On the other hand, existing computational tools are limited to predicting only a few dozen to several hundred genes, and the majority of the methods are designed for bulk RNA-seq. RESULTS: In this context, we propose HE2Gene, the first multi-task learning-based method capable of predicting tens of thousands of spot-level gene expressions along with pathological annotations from H&E-stained images. Experimental results demonstrate that HE2Gene is comparable to state-of-the-art methods and generalizes well on an external dataset without the need for re-training. Moreover, HE2Gene preserves the annotated spatial domains and has the potential to identify biomarkers. This capability facilitates cancer diagnosis and broadens its applicability to investigate gene-disease associations. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code and data information has been deposited at https://github.com/Microbiods/HE2Gene.
34755848	2022	Nucleic acids research	tsRFun: a comprehensive platform for decoding human tsRNA expression, functions and prognostic value by high-throughput small RNA-Seq and CLIP-Seq data.	tRNA-derived small RNA (tsRNA), a novel type of regulatory small noncoding RNA, plays an important role in physiological and pathological processes. However, the understanding of the functional mechanism of tsRNAs in cells and their role in the occurrence and development of diseases is limited. Here, we integrated multiomics data such as transcriptome, epitranscriptome, and targetome data, and developed novel computer tools to establish tsRFun, a comprehensive platform to facilitate tsRNA research (http://rna.sysu.edu.cn/tsRFun/ or http://biomed.nscc-gz.cn/DB/tsRFun/). tsRFun evaluated tsRNA expression profiles and the prognostic value of tsRNAs across 32 types of cancers, identified tsRNA target molecules utilizing high-throughput CLASH/CLEAR or CLIP sequencing data, and constructed the interaction networks among tsRNAs, microRNAs, and mRNAs. In addition to its data presentation capabilities, tsRFun offers multiple real-time online tools for tsRNA identification, target prediction, and functional enrichment analysis. In summary, tsRFun provides a valuable data resource and multiple analysis tools for tsRNA investigation.
39679437	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Cell-specific priors rescue differential gene expression in spatial spot-based technologies.	Spatial transcriptomics (ST), a breakthrough technology, captures the complex structure and state of tissues through the spatial profiling of gene expression. A variety of ST technologies have now emerged, most prominently spot-based platforms such as Visium. Despite the widespread use of ST and its distinct data characteristics, the vast majority of studies continue to analyze ST data using algorithms originally designed for older technologies such as single-cell (SC) and bulk RNA-seq-particularly when identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs). However, it remains unclear whether these algorithms are still valid or appropriate for ST data. Therefore, here, we sought to characterize the performance of these methods by constructing an in silico simulator of ST data with a controllable and known DEG ground truth. Surprisingly, our findings reveal little variation in the performance of classic DEG algorithms-all of which fail to accurately recapture known DEGs to significant levels. We further demonstrate that cellular heterogeneity within spots is a primary cause of this poor performance and propose a simple gene-selection scheme, based on prior knowledge of cell-type specificity, to overcome this. Notably, our approach outperforms existing data-driven methods designed specifically for ST data and offers improved DEG recovery and reliability rates. In summary, our work details a conceptual framework that can be used upstream, agnostically, of any DEG algorithm to improve the accuracy of ST analysis and any downstream findings.
40794943	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	DiffusionST: a deep generative diffusion model-based framework for enhancing spatial transcriptomics data quality and identifying spatial domains.	Recent advancements in spatial transcriptomics (ST) technology have generated substantial volumes of spatial transcriptome data. However, the quality of this data is often compromised due to the limitations of current sequencing technologies. To address this issue, DiffusionST proposes a method for imputing ST data and clustering the imputed data. The method employs a graph convolutional network model combined with a newly designed loss function, denoising data using the zero-inflated negative binomial distribution, and data enhancement through a diffusion model to improve clustering accuracy. DiffusionST demonstrates superior clustering accuracy compared to eight of the most popular ST clustering algorithms. DiffusionST also excels in data imputation when compared to five single-cell RNA sequencing imputation algorithms. Additionally, DiffusionST's robustness against noise is quantitatively validated by manually introducing random dropout noise into the dataset, where our model significantly enhances the quality of ST data. Moreover, DiffusionST is well-suited for high-resolution ST data and has been demonstrated, through survival analysis and cell-cell communication studies, to dissect spatial domains within breast cancer tissues. These findings provide strong evidence of DiffusionST's efficacy in handling ST data especially with strong noise, making it a valuable tool in this field.
38168986	2024	Nature biotechnology	Inferring super-resolution tissue architecture by integrating spatial transcriptomics with histology.	Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has demonstrated enormous potential for generating intricate molecular maps of cells within tissues. Here we present iStar, a method based on hierarchical image feature extraction that integrates ST data and high-resolution histology images to predict spatial gene expression with super-resolution. Our method enhances gene expression resolution to near-single-cell levels in ST and enables gene expression prediction in tissue sections where only histology images are available.
31665479	2020	Nucleic acids research	ProteomicsDB: a multi-omics and multi-organism resource for life science research.	ProteomicsDB (https://www.ProteomicsDB.org) started as a protein-centric in-memory database for the exploration of large collections of quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics data. The data types and contents grew over time to include RNA-Seq expression data, drug-target interactions and cell line viability data. In this manuscript, we summarize new developments since the previous update that was published in Nucleic Acids Research in 2017. Over the past two years, we have enriched the data content by additional datasets and extended the platform to support protein turnover data. Another important new addition is that ProteomicsDB now supports the storage and visualization of data collected from other organisms, exemplified by Arabidopsis thaliana. Due to the generic design of ProteomicsDB, all analytical features available for the original human resource seamlessly transfer to other organisms. Furthermore, we introduce a new service in ProteomicsDB which allows users to upload their own expression datasets and analyze them alongside with data stored in ProteomicsDB. Initially, users will be able to make use of this feature in the interactive heat map functionality as well as the drug sensitivity prediction, but ultimately will be able to use all analytical features of ProteomicsDB in this way.
35561207	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Non-negative Independent Factor Analysis disentangles discrete and continuous sources of variation in scRNA-seq data.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA-seq analysis has emerged as a powerful tool for understanding inter-cellular heterogeneity. Due to the inherent noise of the data, computational techniques often rely on dimensionality reduction (DR) as both a pre-processing step and an analysis tool. Ideally, DR should preserve the biological information while discarding the noise. However, if the DR is to be used directly to gain biological insight it must also be interpretable-that is the individual dimensions of the reduction should correspond to specific biological variables such as cell-type identity or pathway activity. Maximizing biological interpretability necessitates making assumption about the data structures and the choice of the model is critical. RESULTS: We present a new probabilistic single-cell factor analysis model, Non-negative Independent Factor Analysis (NIFA), that incorporates different interpretability inducing assumptions into a single modeling framework. The key advantage of our NIFA model is that it simultaneously models uni- and multi-modal latent factors, and thus isolates discrete cell-type identity and continuous pathway activity into separate components. We apply our approach to a range of datasets where cell-type identity is known, and we show that NIFA-derived factors outperform results from ICA, PCA, NMF and scCoGAPS (an NMF method designed for single-cell data) in terms of disentangling biological sources of variation. Studying an immunotherapy dataset in detail, we show that NIFA is able to reproduce and refine previous findings in a single analysis framework and enables the discovery of new clinically relevant cell states. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: NFIA is a R package which is freely available at GitHub (https://github.com/wgmao/NIFA). The test dataset is archived at https://zenodo.org/record/6286646. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
38287344	2024	Genome biology	Mosaic loss of Y chromosome is associated with aging and epithelial injury in chronic kidney disease.	BACKGROUND: Mosaic loss of Y chromosome (LOY) is the most common chromosomal alteration in aging men. Here, we use single-cell RNA and ATAC sequencing to show that LOY is present in the kidney and increases with age and chronic kidney disease. RESULTS: The likelihood of a cell having LOY varies depending on its location in the nephron. Cortical epithelial cell types have a greater proportion of LOY than medullary or glomerular cell types, which may reflect their proliferative history. Proximal tubule cells are the most abundant cell type in the cortex and are susceptible to hypoxic injury. A subset of these cells acquires a pro-inflammatory transcription and chromatin accessibility profile associated with expression of HAVCR1, VCAM1, and PROM1. These injured epithelial cells have the greatest proportion of LOY and their presence predicts future kidney function decline. Moreover, proximal tubule cells with LOY are more likely to harbor additional large chromosomal gains and express pro-survival pathways. Spatial transcriptomics localizes injured proximal tubule cells to a pro-fibrotic microenvironment where they adopt a secretory phenotype and likely communicate with infiltrating immune cells. CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that LOY is an indicator of increased DNA damage and potential marker of cellular senescence that can be applied to single-cell datasets in other tissues.
40577399	2025	PLoS computational biology	OrgaCCC: Orthogonal graph autoencoders for constructing cell-cell communication networks on spatial transcriptomics data.	Cell-cell communication (CCC) is a fundamental biological process essential for maintaining the functionality of multicellular organisms. It allows cells to coordinate their activities, sustain tissue homeostasis, and adapt to environmental changes. However, understanding the mechanisms underlying intercellular communication remains challenging. The rapid advancements in spatial transcriptomics (ST) have enabled the analysis of CCC within its spatial context. Despite the development of several computational methods for inferring CCCs from ST data, most rely on literature-curated gene or protein interaction lists, which are often inadequate due to the restricted gene coverage. In this work, we propose OrgaCCC, an orthogonal graph autoencoders approach for cell-cell communication inference based on deep generative models. OrgaCCC leverages the information of gene expression profiles, spatial locations and ligand-receptor relationships. It captures both cell/spot and gene features using two orthogonally coupled variational graph autoencoders across cell/spot and gene dimensions and combines them by maximizing the similarity between their reconstructed cell/spot features. Numerical experiments on five ST datasets demonstrate the superiority of OrgaCCC compared with state-of-the-art methods in CCC inference at the cell-type level, cell/spot level, and ligand-receptor level, in terms of inference accuracy and reliability.
35258565	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	spatialGE: quantification and visualization of the tumor microenvironment heterogeneity using spatial transcriptomics.	SUMMARY: Spatially resolved transcriptomics promises to increase our understanding of the tumor microenvironment and improve cancer prognosis and therapies. Nonetheless, analytical methods to explore associations between the spatial heterogeneity of the tumor and clinical data are not available. Hence, we have developed spatialGE, a software that provides visualizations and quantification of the tumor microenvironment heterogeneity through gene expression surfaces, spatial heterogeneity statistics that can be compared against clinical information, spot-level cell deconvolution and spatially informed clustering, all using a new data object to store data and resulting analyses simultaneously. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The R package and tutorial/vignette are available at https://github.com/FridleyLab/spatialGE. A script to reproduce the analyses in this manuscript is available in Supplementary information. The Thrane study data included in spatialGE was made available from the public available from the website https://www.spatialresearch.org/resources-published-datasets/doi-10-1158-0008-5472-can-18-0747/.

39413055	2024	PLoS computational biology	Gene signatures for cancer research: A 25-year retrospective and future avenues.	Over the past two decades, extensive studies, particularly in cancer analysis through large datasets like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), have aimed at improving patient therapies and precision medicine. However, limited overlap and inconsistencies among gene signatures across different cohorts pose challenges. The dynamic nature of the transcriptome, encompassing diverse RNA species and functional complexities at gene and isoform levels, introduces intricacies, and current gene signatures face reproducibility issues due to the unique transcriptomic landscape of each patient. In this context, discrepancies arising from diverse sequencing technologies, data analysis algorithms, and software tools further hinder consistency. While careful experimental design, analytical strategies, and standardized protocols could enhance reproducibility, future prospects lie in multiomics data integration, machine learning techniques, open science practices, and collaborative efforts. Standardized metrics, quality control measures, and advancements in single-cell RNA-seq will contribute to unbiased gene signature identification. In this perspective article, we outline some thoughts and insights addressing challenges, standardized practices, and advanced methodologies enhancing the reliability of gene signatures in disease transcriptomic research.
37496110	2023	Nucleic acids research	Distinct characteristics of two types of alternative lengthening of telomeres in mouse embryonic stem cells.	Telomere length must be maintained in actively dividing cells to avoid cellular arrest or death. In the absence of telomerase activity, activation of alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) allows the maintenance of telomeric length and prolongs the cellular lifespan. Our previous studies have established two types of ALT survivors from mouse embryonic stem cells. The key differences between these ALT survivors are telomere-constituting sequences: non-telomeric sequences and canonical telomeric repeats, with each type of ALT survivors being referred to as type I and type II, respectively. We explored how the characteristics of the two types of ALT lines reflect their fates using multi-omics approaches. The most notable gene expression signatures of type I and type II ALT cell lines were chromatin remodelling and DNA repair, respectively. Compared with type II cells, type I ALT cells accumulated more mutations and demonstrated persistent telomere instability. These findings indicate that cells of the same origin have separate routes for survival, thus providing insights into the plasticity of crisis-suffering cells and cancers.
36690742	2023	Nature methods	Screening cell-cell communication in spatial transcriptomics via collective optimal transport.	Spatial transcriptomic technologies and spatially annotated single-cell RNA sequencing datasets provide unprecedented opportunities to dissect cell-cell communication (CCC). However, incorporation of the spatial information and complex biochemical processes required in the reconstruction of CCC remains a major challenge. Here, we present COMMOT (COMMunication analysis by Optimal Transport) to infer CCC in spatial transcriptomics, which accounts for the competition between different ligand and receptor species as well as spatial distances between cells. A collective optimal transport method is developed to handle complex molecular interactions and spatial constraints. Furthermore, we introduce downstream analysis tools to infer spatial signaling directionality and genes regulated by signaling using machine learning models. We apply COMMOT to simulation data and eight spatial datasets acquired with five different technologies to show its effectiveness and robustness in identifying spatial CCC in data with varying spatial resolutions and gene coverages. Finally, COMMOT identifies new CCCs during skin morphogenesis in a case study of human epidermal development.
38408997	2024	Genome biology	scGIST: gene panel design for spatial transcriptomics with prioritized gene sets.	A critical challenge of single-cell spatial transcriptomics (sc-ST) technologies is their panel size. Being based on fluorescence in situ hybridization, they are typically limited to panels of about a thousand genes. This constrains researchers to build panels from only the marker genes of different cell types and forgo other genes of interest, e.g., genes encoding ligand-receptor complexes or those in specific pathways. We propose scGIST, a constrained feature selection tool that designs sc-ST panels prioritizing user-specified genes without compromising cell type detection accuracy. We demonstrate scGIST's efficacy in diverse use cases, highlighting it as a valuable addition to sc-ST's algorithmic toolbox.

40167331	2025	Nucleic acids research	CellPie: a scalable spatial transcriptomics factor discovery method via joint non-negative matrix factorization.	Spatially resolved transcriptomics has enabled the study of expression of genes within tissues while retaining their spatial identity. Most spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies generate a matched histopathological image as part of the standard pipeline, providing morphological information that can complement the transcriptomics data. Here, we present CellPie, a fast, unsupervised factor discovery method based on joint non-negative matrix factorization of spatial RNA transcripts and histological image features. CellPie employs the accelerated hierarchical least squares method to significantly reduce the computational time, enabling efficient application to high-dimensional ST datasets. We assessed CellPie on three different human cancer types with different spatial resolutions, including a highly resolved Visium HD dataset, demonstrating both good performance and high computational efficiency compared to existing methods.
38189544	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	stAA: adversarial graph autoencoder for spatial clustering task of spatially resolved transcriptomics.	With the development of spatially resolved transcriptomics technologies, it is now possible to explore the gene expression profiles of single cells while preserving their spatial context. Spatial clustering plays a key role in spatial transcriptome data analysis. In the past 2 years, several graph neural network-based methods have emerged, which significantly improved the accuracy of spatial clustering. However, accurately identifying the boundaries of spatial domains remains a challenging task. In this article, we propose stAA, an adversarial variational graph autoencoder, to identify spatial domain. stAA generates cell embedding by leveraging gene expression and spatial information using graph neural networks and enforces the distribution of cell embeddings to a prior distribution through Wasserstein distance. The adversarial training process can make cell embeddings better capture spatial domain information and more robust. Moreover, stAA incorporates global graph information into cell embeddings using labels generated by pre-clustering. Our experimental results show that stAA outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and achieves better clustering results across different profiling platforms and various resolutions. We also conducted numerous biological analyses and found that stAA can identify fine-grained structures in tissues, recognize different functional subtypes within tumors and accurately identify developmental trajectories.
37285319	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	NoVaTeST: identifying genes with location-dependent noise variance in spatial transcriptomics data.	"MOTIVATION: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) can reveal the existence and extent of spatial variation of gene expression in complex tissues. Such analyses could help identify spatially localized processes underlying a tissue's function. Existing tools to detect spatially variable genes assume a constant noise variance across spatial locations. This assumption might miss important biological signals when the variance can change across locations. RESULTS: In this article, we propose NoVaTeST, a framework to identify genes with location-dependent noise variance in ST data. NoVaTeST models gene expression as a function of spatial location and allows the noise to vary spatially. NoVaTeST then statistically compares this model to one with constant noise and detects genes showing significant spatial noise variation. We refer to these genes as ""noisy genes."" In tumor samples, the noisy genes detected by NoVaTeST are largely independent of the spatially variable genes detected by existing tools that assume constant noise, and provide important biological insights into tumor microenvironments. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: An implementation of the NoVaTeST framework in Python along with instructions for running the pipeline is available at https://github.com/abidabrar-bracu/NoVaTeST."
40082609	2025	Nature methods	Optimizing Xenium In Situ data utility by quality assessment and best-practice analysis workflows.	The Xenium In Situ platform is a new spatial transcriptomics product commercialized by 10x Genomics, capable of mapping hundreds of genes in situ at subcellular resolution. Given the multitude of commercially available spatial transcriptomics technologies, recommendations in choice of platform and analysis guidelines are increasingly important. Herein, we explore 25 Xenium datasets generated from multiple tissues and species, comparing scalability, resolution, data quality, capacities and limitations with eight other spatially resolved transcriptomics technologies and commercial platforms. In addition, we benchmark the performance of multiple open-source computational tools, when applied to Xenium datasets, in tasks including preprocessing, cell segmentation, selection of spatially variable features and domain identification. This study serves as an independent analysis of the performance of Xenium, and provides best practices and recommendations for analysis of such datasets.
40966657	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	A comprehensive comparison on clustering methods for multi-slice spatially resolved transcriptomics data analysis.	Spatial transcriptomics (ST) data, by providing spatial information, enable simultaneous analysis of gene expression distributions and their spatial patterns within tissue. Clustering or spatial domain detection represents an essential methodology for ST data, facilitating the exploration of spatial organizations with shared gene expression or histological characteristics. Traditionally, clustering algorithms for ST have focused on individual tissue sections. However, the emergence of numerous contiguous tissue sections derived from the same or similar tissue specimens within or across individuals has led to the development of multi-slice clustering methods. In this study, we assess seven single-slice and four multi-slice clustering methods on two simulated datasets and four real datasets. Additionally, we investigate the effectiveness of preprocessing techniques, including spatial coordinate alignment (e.g. PASTE) and gene expression batch effect removal (e.g. Harmony), on clustering performance. Our study provides a comprehensive comparison of clustering methods for multi-slice ST data, serving as a practical guide for method selection in various scenarios.
24922310	2014	PLoS computational biology	CGBayesNets: conditional Gaussian Bayesian network learning and inference with mixed discrete and continuous data.	Bayesian Networks (BN) have been a popular predictive modeling formalism in bioinformatics, but their application in modern genomics has been slowed by an inability to cleanly handle domains with mixed discrete and continuous variables. Existing free BN software packages either discretize continuous variables, which can lead to information loss, or do not include inference routines, which makes prediction with the BN impossible. We present CGBayesNets, a BN package focused around prediction of a clinical phenotype from mixed discrete and continuous variables, which fills these gaps. CGBayesNets implements Bayesian likelihood and inference algorithms for the conditional Gaussian Bayesian network (CGBNs) formalism, one appropriate for predicting an outcome of interest from, e.g., multimodal genomic data. We provide four different network learning algorithms, each making a different tradeoff between computational cost and network likelihood. CGBayesNets provides a full suite of functions for model exploration and verification, including cross validation, bootstrapping, and AUC manipulation. We highlight several results obtained previously with CGBayesNets, including predictive models of wood properties from tree genomics, leukemia subtype classification from mixed genomic data, and robust prediction of intensive care unit mortality outcomes from metabolomic profiles. We also provide detailed example analysis on public metabolomic and gene expression datasets. CGBayesNets is implemented in MATLAB and available as MATLAB source code, under an Open Source license and anonymous download at http://www.cgbayesnets.com.
34623423	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Clustering spatial transcriptomics data.	MOTIVATION: Recent advancements in fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques enable them to concurrently obtain information on the location and gene expression of single cells. A key question in the initial analysis of such spatial transcriptomics data is the assignment of cell types. To date, most studies used methods that only rely on the expression levels of the genes in each cell for such assignments. To fully utilize the data and to improve the ability to identify novel sub-types, we developed a new method, FICT, which combines both expression and neighborhood information when assigning cell types. RESULTS: FICT optimizes a probabilistic function that we formalize and for which we provide learning and inference algorithms. We used FICT to analyze both simulated and several real spatial transcriptomics data. As we show, FICT can accurately identify cell types and sub-types, improving on expression only methods and other methods proposed for clustering spatial transcriptomics data. Some of the spatial sub-types identified by FICT provide novel hypotheses about the new functions for excitatory and inhibitory neurons. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: FICT is available at: https://github.com/haotianteng/FICT. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
40097810	2025	Nature methods	A computational pipeline for spatial mechano-transcriptomics.	Advances in spatial profiling technologies are providing insights into how molecular programs are influenced by local signaling and environmental cues. However, cell fate specification and tissue patterning involve the interplay of biochemical and mechanical feedback. Here we develop a computational framework that enables the joint statistical analysis of transcriptional and mechanical signals in the context of spatial transcriptomics. To illustrate the application and utility of the approach, we use spatial transcriptomics data from the developing mouse embryo to infer the forces acting on individual cells, and use these results to identify mechanical, morphometric and gene expression signatures that are predictive of tissue compartment boundaries. In addition, we use geoadditive structural equation modeling to identify gene modules that predict the mechanical behavior of cells in an unbiased manner. This computational framework is easily generalized to other spatial profiling contexts, providing a generic scheme for exploring the interplay of biomolecular and mechanical cues in tissues.
38940152	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Probabilistic pathway-based multimodal factor analysis.	MOTIVATION: Multimodal profiling strategies promise to produce more informative insights into biomedical cohorts via the integration of the information each modality contributes. To perform this integration, however, the development of novel analytical strategies is needed. Multimodal profiling strategies often come at the expense of lower sample numbers, which can challenge methods to uncover shared signals across a cohort. Thus, factor analysis approaches are commonly used for the analysis of high-dimensional data in molecular biology, however, they typically do not yield representations that are directly interpretable, whereas many research questions often center around the analysis of pathways associated with specific observations. RESULTS: We develop PathFA, a novel approach for multimodal factor analysis over the space of pathways. PathFA produces integrative and interpretable views across multimodal profiling technologies, which allow for the derivation of concrete hypotheses. PathFA combines a pathway-learning approach with integrative multimodal capability under a Bayesian procedure that is efficient, hyper-parameter free, and able to automatically infer observation noise from the data. We demonstrate strong performance on small sample sizes within our simulation framework and on matched proteomics and transcriptomics profiles from real tumor samples taken from the Swiss Tumor Profiler consortium. On a subcohort of melanoma patients, PathFA recovers pathway activity that has been independently associated with poor outcome. We further demonstrate the ability of this approach to identify pathways associated with the presence of specific cell-types as well as tumor heterogeneity. Our results show that we capture known biology, making it well suited for analyzing multimodal sample cohorts. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The tool is implemented in python and available at https://github.com/ratschlab/path-fa.
40181168	2025	Nature biotechnology	Scalable spatial transcriptomics through computational array reconstruction.	Spatial transcriptomics enables gene expression mapping within tissues but is often limited by imaging constraints. We present an imaging-free approach that reconstructs spatial barcode locations using molecular diffusion and dimensionality reduction. Validated against ground truth imaging, our method achieves high fidelity and scales to centimeter-sized tissues. This approach enhances spatial transcriptomics' accessibility and throughput, enabling large-scale studies without specialized imaging equipment.
32778152	2020	Genome biology	The chromosome-level wintersweet (Chimonanthus praecox) genome provides insights into floral scent biosynthesis and flowering in winter.	BACKGROUND: Wintersweet (Chimonanthus praecox), an important ornamental plant, has evolved unique fragrant aroma and winter-flowering properties, which are critical for its successful sexual reproduction. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these traits are largely unknown in this species. In addition, wintersweet is also a typical representative species of the magnoliids, where the phylogenetic position of which relative to eudicots and monocots has not been conclusively resolved. RESULTS: Here, we present a chromosome-level wintersweet genome assembly with a total size of 695.36 Mb and a draft genome assembly of Calycanthus chinensis. Phylogenetic analyses of 17 representative angiosperm genomes suggest that Magnoliids and eudicots are sister to monocots. Whole-genome duplication signatures reveal two major duplication events in the evolutionary history of the wintersweet genome, with an ancient one shared by Laurales, and a more recent one shared by the Calycantaceae. Whole-genome duplication and tandem duplication events have significant impacts on copy numbers of genes related to terpene and benzenoid/phenylpropanoid (the main floral scent volatiles) biosynthesis, which may contribute to the characteristic aroma formation. An integrative analysis combining cytology with genomic and transcriptomic data reveals biological characteristics of wintersweet, such as floral transition in spring, floral organ specification, low temperature-mediated floral bud break, early blooming in winter, and strong cold tolerance. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide insights into the evolutionary history of wintersweet and the relationships among the Magnoliids, monocots, and eudicots; the molecular basis underlying floral scent biosynthesis; and winter flowering, and highlight the utility of multi-omics data in deciphering important ornamental traits in wintersweet.
34872616	2021	Genome biology	geneBasis: an iterative approach for unsupervised selection of targeted gene panels from scRNA-seq.	scRNA-seq datasets are increasingly used to identify gene panels that can be probed using alternative technologies, such as spatial transcriptomics, where choosing the best subset of genes is vital. Existing methods are limited by a reliance on pre-existing cell type labels or by difficulties in identifying markers of rare cells. We introduce an iterative approach, geneBasis, for selecting an optimal gene panel, where each newly added gene captures the maximum distance between the true manifold and the manifold constructed using the currently selected gene panel. Our approach outperforms existing strategies and can resolve cell types and subtle cell state differences.
35927760	2022	Genome biology	BASS: multi-scale and multi-sample analysis enables accurate cell type clustering and spatial domain detection in spatial transcriptomic studies.	Spatial transcriptomic studies are reaching single-cell spatial resolution, with data often collected from multiple tissue sections. Here, we present a computational method, BASS, that enables multi-scale and multi-sample analysis for single-cell resolution spatial transcriptomics. BASS performs cell type clustering at the single-cell scale and spatial domain detection at the tissue regional scale, with the two tasks carried out simultaneously within a Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework. We illustrate the benefits of BASS through comprehensive simulations and applications to three datasets. The substantial power gain brought by BASS allows us to reveal accurate transcriptomic and cellular landscape in both cortex and hypothalamus.
41024097	2025	Genome biology	Benchmarking multi-slice integration and downstream applications in spatial transcriptomics data analysis.	BACKGROUND: Spatial transcriptomics preserves spatial context of tissues while capturing gene expression. As the technology advances, researchers are increasingly generating data from multiple tissue sections, creating a growing demand for multi-slice integration methods. These methods aim to generate spatially aware embeddings that jointly capture spatial and transcriptomic information, preserving biological signals while mitigating technical artifacts such as batch effects. However, the reliability of these methods varies, and the growing diversity of technologies makes integration even more challenging. This underscores the need for a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate their performance, which is still lacking. RESULTS: To systematically evaluate the performance of multi-slice integration methods, we propose a comprehensive benchmarking framework covering four key tasks that form an upstream-to-downstream pipeline: multi-slice integration, spatial clustering, spatial alignment, slice representation. For each task, we perform detailed analyses of the methods and provide actionable recommendations. Our results reveal substantial data-dependent variation in performance across tasks. We further investigate the relationships between upstream and downstream tasks, showing that downstream performance often depends on upstream quality. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a comprehensive benchmark of 12 multi-slice integration methods across four key tasks using 19 diverse datasets. Our results reveal that method performance is highly dependent on application context, dataset size, and technology. We also identified strong interdependencies between upstream and downstream tasks, highlighting the importance of robust early-stage analysis.
30482222	2018	Genome biology	Linking single-cell measurements of mass, growth rate, and gene expression.	Mass and growth rate are highly integrative measures of cell physiology not discernable via genomic measurements. Here, we introduce a microfluidic platform enabling direct measurement of single-cell mass and growth rate upstream of highly multiplexed single-cell profiling such as single-cell RNA sequencing. We resolve transcriptional signatures associated with single-cell mass and growth rate in L1210 and FL5.12 cell lines and activated CD8+ T cells. Further, we demonstrate a framework using these linked measurements to characterize biophysical heterogeneity in a patient-derived glioblastoma cell line with and without drug treatment. Our results highlight the value of coupled phenotypic metrics in guiding single-cell genomics.
39073832	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Herb-CMap: a multimodal fusion framework for deciphering the mechanisms of action in traditional Chinese medicine using Suhuang antitussive capsule as a case study.	Herbal medicines, particularly traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs), are a rich source of natural products with significant therapeutic potential. However, understanding their mechanisms of action is challenging due to the complexity of their multi-ingredient compositions. We introduced Herb-CMap, a multimodal fusion framework leveraging protein-protein interactions and herb-perturbed gene expression signatures. Utilizing a network-based heat diffusion algorithm, Herb-CMap creates a connectivity map linking herb perturbations to their therapeutic targets, thereby facilitating the prioritization of active ingredients. As a case study, we applied Herb-CMap to Suhuang antitussive capsule (Suhuang), a TCM formula used for treating cough variant asthma (CVA). Using in vivo rat models, our analysis established the transcriptomic signatures of Suhuang and identified its key compounds, such as quercetin and luteolin, and their target genes, including IL17A, PIK3CB, PIK3CD, AKT1, and TNF. These drug-target interactions inhibit the IL-17 signaling pathway and deactivate PI3K, AKT, and NF-kappaB, effectively reducing lung inflammation and alleviating CVA. The study demonstrates the efficacy of Herb-CMap in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of herbal medicines, offering valuable insights for advancing drug discovery in TCM.
34718715	2022	Nucleic acids research	OncoDB: an interactive online database for analysis of gene expression and viral infection in cancer.	Large-scale multi-omics datasets, most prominently from the TCGA consortium, have been made available to the public for systematic characterization of human cancers. However, to date, there is a lack of corresponding online resources to utilize these valuable data to study gene expression dysregulation and viral infection, two major causes for cancer development and progression. To address these unmet needs, we established OncoDB, an online database resource to explore abnormal patterns in gene expression as well as viral infection that are correlated to clinical features in cancer. Specifically, OncoDB integrated RNA-seq, DNA methylation, and related clinical data from over 10 000 cancer patients in the TCGA study as well as from normal tissues in the GTEx study. Another unique aspect of OncoDB is its focus on oncoviruses. By mining TCGA RNA-seq data, we have identified six major oncoviruses across cancer types and further correlated viral infection to changes in host gene expression and clinical outcomes. All the analysis results are integratively presented in OncoDB with a flexible web interface to search for data related to RNA expression, DNA methylation, viral infection, and clinical features of the cancer patients. OncoDB is freely accessible at http://oncodb.org.
37537351	2023	Nature methods	Dictys: dynamic gene regulatory network dissects developmental continuum with single-cell multiomics.	Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are key determinants of cell function and identity and are dynamically rewired during development and disease. Despite decades of advancement, challenges remain in GRN inference, including dynamic rewiring, causal inference, feedback loop modeling and context specificity. To address these challenges, we develop Dictys, a dynamic GRN inference and analysis method that leverages multiomic single-cell assays of chromatin accessibility and gene expression, context-specific transcription factor footprinting, stochastic process network and efficient probabilistic modeling of single-cell RNA-sequencing read counts. Dictys improves GRN reconstruction accuracy and reproducibility and enables the inference and comparative analysis of context-specific and dynamic GRNs across developmental contexts. Dictys' network analyses recover unique insights in human blood and mouse skin development with cell-type-specific and dynamic GRNs. Its dynamic network visualizations enable time-resolved discovery and investigation of developmental driver transcription factors and their regulated targets. Dictys is available as a free, open-source and user-friendly Python package.
41206038	2025	Nucleic acids research	Transcriptional regulatory networks of the human gut symbiont Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron are uncovered using machine learning.	Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482 is a prominent human gut symbiont of increasing importance to human health and therapeutic applications. Despite its significance, the transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) governing its survival and resilience in vivo remains poorly understood. Here, we present BtModulome, a comprehensive transcriptional regulatory framework derived from independent component analysis of 461 RNA-seq datasets spanning diverse niche-specific conditions and genetic backgrounds. This analysis revealed the BtModulome consisting of 110 independently modulated gene sets (iModulons), explaining 72.9% of the variance in the RNA-seq dataset. We validated strong associations with 39 known regulators and identified 311 novel regulator-regulon relationships, accounting for 22.4% expansion of the known TRN of B. thetaiotaomicron. In addition, we functionally characterized 11 ECF-sigmas, including SigW-1, which orchestrates arylsulfatase expression critical for host colonization, and SigH-1, which mediates (p)ppGpp-dependent stringent response. Integration of iModulon activities with multi-omics datasets provided mechanistic insights into stress responses and carbon utilization both in vitro and in vivo. This comprehensive TRN framework establishes a foundation for understanding adaptive mechanisms in gut commensals and demonstrates the utility of module-centric analysis for biological discovery in non-model organisms.
39498488	2025	Nucleic acids research	EXPRESSO: a multi-omics database to explore multi-layered 3D genomic organization.

39970279	2025	Nucleic acids research	Precise gene expression deconvolution in spatial transcriptomics with STged.	"Spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) has transformed tissue biology by linking gene expression profiles with spatial information. However, sequencing-based SRT methods aggregate signals from multiple cell types within capture locations (""spots""), masking cell-type-specific gene expression patterns. Traditional cell-type deconvolution methods estimate cell compositions within spots but fail to resolve cell-type-specific gene expression, limiting their ability to uncover critical biological processes such as cellular interactions and microenvironmental dynamics. Here, we present STged (spatial transcriptomic gene expression deconvolution), a novel computational framework that goes beyond traditional deconvolution by reconstructing cell-type-specific gene expression profiles from mixed spots. STged integrates graph-based spatial correlations and reference-derived gene signatures using a non-negative least-squares regression framework, achieving precise and biologically meaningful deconvolution. Comprehensive simulations show that STged consistently outperforms existing methods in accuracy and robustness. Applications to human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and human squamous cell carcinoma datasets reveal its capacity to identify microenvironment-specific highly variable genes, reconstruct spatial cell-cell communication networks, and resolve tissue architecture at near-single-cell resolution. In mouse kidney tissues, STged uncovers dynamic spatial gene expression patterns and distinct gene programs, advancing our understanding of tissue heterogeneity and cellular dynamics."
39400541	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Statistical batch-aware embedded integration, dimension reduction, and alignment for spatial transcriptomics.	MOTIVATION: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies provide richer insights into the molecular characteristics of cells by simultaneously measuring gene expression profiles and their relative locations. However, each slice can only contain limited biological variation, and since there are almost always non-negligible batch effects across different slices, integrating numerous slices to account for batch effects and locations is not straightforward. Performing multi-slice integration, dimensionality reduction, and other downstream analyses separately often results in suboptimal embeddings for technical artifacts and biological variations. Joint modeling integrating these steps can enhance our understanding of the complex interplay between technical artifacts and biological signals, leading to more accurate and insightful results. RESULTS: In this context, we propose a hierarchical hidden Markov random field model STADIA to reduce batch effects, extract common biological patterns across multiple ST slices, and simultaneously identify spatial domains. We demonstrate the effectiveness of STADIA using five datasets from different species (human and mouse), various organs (brain, skin, and liver), and diverse platforms (10x Visium, ST, and Slice-seqV2). STADIA can capture common tissue structures across multiple slices and preserve slice-specific biological signals. In addition, STADIA outperforms the other three competing methods (PRECAST, fastMNN, and Harmony) in terms of the balance between batch mixing and spatial domain identification, and it demonstrates the advantage of joint modeling when compared to STAGATE and GraphST. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code implemented by R is available at https://github.com/zhanglabtools/STADIA and archived with version 1.01 on Zenodo https://zenodo.org/records/13637744.
40619810	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Gene regulatory network integration with multi-omics data enhances survival predictions in cancer.	The emergence of high-throughput omics technologies has resulted in their wide application to cancer studies, greatly increasing our understanding of the disruptions occurring at different molecular levels. To fully harness these data, integrative approaches have emerged as essential tools, enabling the combination of multiple omics modalities to uncover disease mechanisms. However, many such approaches overlook gene regulatory mechanisms, which play a central role in the development and progression of cancer. Patient-specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs), representing interactions between regulators (such as transcription factors) and their target genes in each individual tumour, offer a powerful framework to bridge this gap and investigate the regulatory landscape of cancer. In this study, we introduce a novel approach for integrating patient-specific GRNs with multi-omic data and assess whether their inclusion in joint dimensionality reduction models improves survival prediction across multiple cancer types. By applying our method on ten cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we demonstrate that incorporating GRNs enhances associations with patient survival in several cancer types. Focusing on liver cancer, with validation in independent data, our methodology identifies potential mechanisms of gene regulatory dysregulation associated with cancer progression. These were linked to dysregulated fatty acid metabolism, and identified JUND as a potential novel transcriptional regulator driving these processes. Our findings highlight the value of network-based multi-omics integration for uncovering clinically relevant regulatory mechanisms and improving our understanding of cancer biology at the patient-specific level.
40317049	2025	Genome biology	SlideCNA: spatial copy number alteration detection from Slide-seq-like spatial transcriptomics data.	Solid tumors are spatially heterogeneous in their genetic, molecular, and cellular composition, but recent spatial profiling studies have mostly charted genetic and RNA variation in tumors separately. To leverage the potential of RNA to identify copy number alterations (CNAs), we develop SlideCNA, a computational tool to extract CNA signals from sparse spatial transcriptomics data with near single cellular resolution. SlideCNA uses expression-aware spatial binning to overcome sparsity limitations while maintaining spatial signal to recover CNA patterns. We test SlideCNA on simulated and real Slide-seq data of (metastatic) breast cancer and demonstrate its potential for spatial subclone detection.
36124784	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	DrDimont: explainable drug response prediction from differential analysis of multi-omics networks.	MOTIVATION: While it has been well established that drugs affect and help patients differently, personalized drug response predictions remain challenging. Solutions based on single omics measurements have been proposed, and networks provide means to incorporate molecular interactions into reasoning. However, how to integrate the wealth of information contained in multiple omics layers still poses a complex problem. RESULTS: We present DrDimont, Drug response prediction from Differential analysis of multi-omics networks. It allows for comparative conclusions between two conditions and translates them into differential drug response predictions. DrDimont focuses on molecular interactions. It establishes condition-specific networks from correlation within an omics layer that are then reduced and combined into heterogeneous, multi-omics molecular networks. A novel semi-local, path-based integration step ensures integrative conclusions. Differential predictions are derived from comparing the condition-specific integrated networks. DrDimont's predictions are explainable, i.e. molecular differences that are the source of high differential drug scores can be retrieved. We predict differential drug response in breast cancer using transcriptomics, proteomics, phosphosite and metabolomics measurements and contrast estrogen receptor positive and receptor negative patients. DrDimont performs better than drug prediction based on differential protein expression or PageRank when evaluating it on ground truth data from cancer cell lines. We find proteomic and phosphosite layers to carry most information for distinguishing drug response. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: DrDimont is available on CRAN: https://cran.r-project.org/package=DrDimont. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
40233119	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	A multi-view graph convolutional network framework based on adaptive adjacency matrix and multi-strategy fusion mechanism for identifying spatial domains.	MOTIVATION: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) addresses the loss of spatial context in single-cell RNA-sequencing by simultaneously capturing gene expression and spatial location information. A critical task of ST is the identification of spatial domains. However, challenges such as high noise levels and data sparsity make the identification process more difficult. RESULTS: To tackle these challenges, STMGAMF, a multi-view graph convolutional network model that employs an adaptive adjacency matrix and a multi-strategy fusion mechanism is proposed. STMGAMF dynamically adjusts the edge weights to capture complex spatial structures during training by implementing the adaptive adjacency matrix and optimizes the embedded features through the multi-strategy fusion mechanism. STMGAMF is evaluated on multiple ST datasets and outperforms existing algorithms in tasks like spatial domain identification, visualization, and spatial trajectory inference. Its robust performance in spatial domain identification and strong generalization capability position STMGAMF as a valuable tool for unraveling the complexity of tissue structures and underlying biological processes. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Source code is available at Github (https://github.com/Fuyh0628/STMGAMF) and Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/records/15103358).
27640647	2016	Genome biology	Multiplexed, targeted profiling of single-cell proteomes and transcriptomes in a single reaction.	We present a scalable, integrated strategy for coupled protein and RNA detection from single cells. Our approach leverages the DNA polymerase activity of reverse transcriptase to simultaneously perform proximity extension assays and complementary DNA synthesis in the same reaction. Using the Fluidigm C1 system, we profile the transcriptomic and proteomic response of a human breast adenocarcinoma cell line to a chemical perturbation, benchmarking against in situ hybridizations and immunofluorescence staining, as well as recombinant proteins, ERCC Spike-Ins, and population lysate dilutions. Through supervised and unsupervised analyses, we demonstrate synergies enabled by simultaneous measurement of single-cell protein and RNA abundances. Collectively, our generalizable approach highlights the potential for molecular metadata to inform highly-multiplexed single-cell analyses.
35659722	2022	Genome biology	De novo reconstruction of cell interaction landscapes from single-cell spatial transcriptome data with DeepLinc.	Based on a deep generative model of variational graph autoencoder (VGAE), we develop a new method, DeepLinc (deep learning framework for Landscapes of Interacting Cells), for the de novo reconstruction of cell interaction networks from single-cell spatial transcriptomic data. DeepLinc demonstrates high efficiency in learning from imperfect and incomplete spatial transcriptome data, filtering false interactions, and imputing missing distal and proximal interactions. The latent representations learned by DeepLinc are also used for inferring the signature genes contributing to the cell interaction landscapes, and for reclustering the cells based on the spatially coded cell heterogeneity in complex tissues at single-cell resolution.
40704686	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Enhancing and accelerating cell type deconvolution of large-scale spatial transcriptomics slices with dual network model.	MOTIVATION: Cell type deconvolution deciphers spatial distribution of mRNA transcripts at single cell level by integrating single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics data to infer mixture of cell types of spots in slices. Current algorithms are criticized for neglecting connection between scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data, as well as time-consuming, hampering their application to large-scale datasets. RESULTS: In this study, we propose a joint learning nonnegative matrix factorization algorithm for fast cell type deconvolution (aka jMF2D), which integrates scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data with network models. To bridge scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data, jMF2D jointly learns cell type similarity network to enhance quality of signatures of cell types, thereby promoting accuracy and efficiency of deconvolution. Experiments demonstrate that jMF2D outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accuracy by saving about 90% running time on various datasets generated by different platforms. Furthermore, it can also facilitates the identification of spatial domains and bio-marker genes, providing an efficient and effective model for analyzing spatial transcriptomics data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The software is coded using python, and is free available for academic https://github.com/xkmaxidian/jMF2D.
36416120	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	From single- to multi-omics: future research trends in medicinal plants.	Medicinal plants are the main source of natural metabolites with specialised pharmacological activities and have been widely examined by plant researchers. Numerous omics studies of medicinal plants have been performed to identify molecular markers of species and functional genes controlling key biological traits, as well as to understand biosynthetic pathways of bioactive metabolites and the regulatory mechanisms of environmental responses. Omics technologies have been widely applied to medicinal plants, including as taxonomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics, genomics, pangenomics, epigenomics and mutagenomics. However, because of the complex biological regulation network, single omics usually fail to explain the specific biological phenomena. In recent years, reports of integrated multi-omics studies of medicinal plants have increased. Until now, there have few assessments of recent developments and upcoming trends in omics studies of medicinal plants. We highlight recent developments in omics research of medicinal plants, summarise the typical bioinformatics resources available for analysing omics datasets, and discuss related future directions and challenges. This information facilitates further studies of medicinal plants, refinement of current approaches and leads to new ideas.
37827697	2023	Genome research	ESICCC as a systematic computational framework for evaluation, selection, and integration of cell-cell communication inference methods.	Cell-cell communication (CCC) is critical for determining cell fates and functions in multicellular organisms. With the advent of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics (ST), an increasing number of CCC inference methods have been developed. Nevertheless, a thorough comparison of their performances is yet to be conducted. To fill this gap, we developed a systematic benchmark framework called ESICCC to evaluate 18 ligand-receptor (LR) inference methods and five ligand/receptor-target inference methods using a total of 116 data sets, including 15 ST data sets, 15 sets of cell line perturbation data, two sets of cell type-specific expression/proteomics data, and 84 sets of sampled or unsampled scRNA-seq data. We evaluated and compared the agreement, accuracy, robustness, and usability of these methods. Regarding accuracy evaluation, RNAMagnet, CellChat, and scSeqComm emerge as the three best-performing methods for intercellular ligand-receptor inference based on scRNA-seq data, whereas stMLnet and HoloNet are the best methods for predicting ligand/receptor-target regulation using ST data. To facilitate the practical applications, we provide a decision-tree-style guideline for users to easily choose best tools for their specific research concerns in CCC inference, and develop an ensemble pipeline CCCbank that enables versatile combinations of methods and databases. Moreover, our comparative results also uncover several critical influential factors for CCC inference, such as prior interaction information, ligand-receptor scoring algorithm, intracellular signaling complexity, and spatial relationship, which may be considered in the future studies to advance the development of new methodologies.
35536286	2022	Nucleic acids research	ICARUS, an interactive web server for single cell RNA-seq analysis.	Here we present ICARUS, a web server to enable users without experience in R to undertake single cell RNA-seq analysis. The focal point of ICARUS is its intuitive tutorial-style user interface, designed to guide logical navigation through the multitude of pre-processing, analysis and visualization steps. ICARUS is easily accessible through a dedicated web server (https://launch.icarus-scrnaseq.cloud.edu.au/) and avoids installation of software on the user's computer. Notable features include the facility to apply quality control thresholds and adjust dimensionality reduction and cell clustering parameters. Data is visualized through 2D/3D UMAP and t-SNE plots and may be curated to remove potential confounders such as cell cycle heterogeneity. ICARUS offers flexible differential expression analysis with user-defined cell groups and gene set enrichment analysis to identify likely affected biological pathways. Eleven organisms including human, dog, mouse, rat, zebrafish, fruit fly, nematode, yeast, cattle, chicken and pig are currently supported. Visualization of multimodal data including those generated by CITE-seq and the 10X Genomics Multiome kit is included. ICARUS incorporates a function to save the current state of analysis avoiding computationally intensive steps during repeat analysis. The complete analysis of a typical single cell RNA-seq dataset by inexperienced users may be achieved in 1-2 h.
39052868	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Compound-SNE: Comparative alignment of t-SNEs for multiple single-cell omics data visualisation.	SUMMARY: One of the first steps in single-cell omics data analysis is visualization, which allows researchers to see how well-separated cell-types are from each other. When visualizing multiple datasets at once, data integration/batch correction methods are used to merge the datasets. While needed for downstream analyses, these methods modify features space (e.g. gene expression)/PCA space in order to mix cell-types between batches as well as possible. This obscures sample-specific features and breaks down local embedding structures that can be seen when a sample is embedded alone. Therefore, in order to improve in visual comparisons between large numbers of samples (e.g., multiple patients, omic modalities, different time points), we introduce Compound-SNE, which performs what we term a soft alignment of samples in embedding space. We show that Compound-SNE is able to align cell-types in embedding space across samples, while preserving local embedding structures from when samples are embedded independently. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Python code for Compound-SNE is available for download at https://github.com/HaghverdiLab/Compound-SNE. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Available online. Provides algorithmic details and additional tests.
40619422	2025	Genome biology	Systematic assessment of microenvironment-dependent transcriptional patterns and intercellular communication.	BACKGROUND: Understanding cell-cell communication and its dependence on spatial organization is critical for unraveling tissue complexity and organ function, and it has been demonstrated that cells are influenced by their microenvironment and neighboring cells, affecting their gene expression and intercellular interactions. This study integrates single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with spatial transcriptomics (ST) to systematically assess how spatial niches influence gene expression and intercellular communication. RESULTS: Using breast cancer, brain cortex, and heart datasets, our analyses reveal limited global transcriptional changes in cells depending on their spatial microenvironment, with differential gene expression observed in half of the samples explored. Moreover, cell-cell communication predictions, derived from ligand-receptor pairs, exhibit minimal correlation with spatial colocalization of cell types. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our study underscores the limitations of using scRNA-seq data to capture niche-specific molecular interactions, even when spatial information is leveraged, and it highlights the need for novel strategies to refine our understanding of intercellular communication dynamics at the molecular level.
36515467	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Benchmarking and integration of methods for deconvoluting spatial transcriptomic data.	MOTIVATION: The rapid development of spatial transcriptomics (ST) approaches has provided new insights into understanding tissue architecture and function. However, the gene expressions measured at a spot may contain contributions from multiple cells due to the low-resolution of current ST technologies. Although many computational methods have been developed to disentangle discrete cell types from spatial mixtures, the community lacks a thorough evaluation of the performance of those deconvolution methods. RESULTS: Here, we present a comprehensive benchmarking of 14 deconvolution methods on four datasets. Furthermore, we investigate the robustness of different methods to sequencing depth, spot size and the choice of normalization. Moreover, we propose a new ensemble learning-based deconvolution method (EnDecon) by integrating multiple individual methods for more accurate deconvolution. The major new findings include: (i) cell2loction, RCTD and spatialDWLS are more accurate than other ST deconvolution methods, based on the evaluation of three metrics: RMSE, PCC and JSD; (ii) cell2location and spatialDWLS are more robust to the variation of sequencing depth than RCTD; (iii) the accuracy of the existing methods tends to decrease as the spot size becomes smaller; (iv) most deconvolution methods perform best when they normalize ST data using the method described in their original papers; and (v) the integrative method, EnDecon, could achieve more accurate ST deconvolution. Our study provides valuable information and guideline for practically applying ST deconvolution tools and developing new and more effective methods. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The benchmarking pipeline is available at https://github.com/SunXQlab/ST-deconvoulution. An R package for EnDecon is available at https://github.com/SunXQlab/EnDecon. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
37039825	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	FISHFactor: a probabilistic factor model for spatial transcriptomics data with subcellular resolution.	MOTIVATION: Factor analysis is a widely used tool for unsupervised dimensionality reduction of high-throughput datasets in molecular biology, with recently proposed extensions designed specifically for spatial transcriptomics data. However, these methods expect (count) matrices as data input and are therefore not directly applicable to single molecule resolution data, which are in the form of coordinate lists annotated with genes and provide insight into subcellular spatial expression patterns. To address this, we here propose FISHFactor, a probabilistic factor model that combines the benefits of spatial, non-negative factor analysis with a Poisson point process likelihood to explicitly model and account for the nature of single molecule resolution data. In addition, FISHFactor shares information across a potentially large number of cells in a common weight matrix, allowing consistent interpretation of factors across cells and yielding improved latent variable estimates. RESULTS: We compare FISHFactor to existing methods that rely on aggregating information through spatial binning and cannot combine information from multiple cells and show that our method leads to more accurate results on simulated data. We show that our method is scalable and can be readily applied to large datasets. Finally, we demonstrate on a real dataset that FISHFactor is able to identify major subcellular expression patterns and spatial gene clusters in a data-driven manner. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The model implementation, data simulation and experiment scripts are available under https://www.github.com/bioFAM/FISHFactor.
36383176	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	scAWMV: an adaptively weighted multi-view learning framework for the integrative analysis of parallel scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data.	MOTIVATION: Technological advances have enabled us to profile single-cell multi-omics data from the same cells, providing us with an unprecedented opportunity to understand the cellular phenotype and links to its genotype. The available protocols and multi-omics datasets [including parallel single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) data profiled from the same cell] are growing increasingly. However, such data are highly sparse and tend to have high level of noise, making data analysis challenging. The methods that integrate the multi-omics data can potentially improve the capacity of revealing the cellular heterogeneity. RESULTS: We propose an adaptively weighted multi-view learning (scAWMV) method for the integrative analysis of parallel scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data profiled from the same cell. scAWMV considers both the difference in importance across different modalities in multi-omics data and the biological connection of the features in the scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data. It generates biologically meaningful low-dimensional representations for the transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles via unsupervised learning. Application to four real datasets demonstrates that our framework scAWMV is an efficient method to dissect cellular heterogeneity for single-cell multi-omics data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The software and datasets are available at https://github.com/pengchengzeng/scAWMV. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
30509292	2018	Genome biology	Understanding tumor ecosystems by single-cell sequencing: promises and limitations.	Cellular heterogeneity within and across tumors has been a major obstacle in understanding and treating cancer, and the complex heterogeneity is masked if bulk tumor tissues are used for analysis. The advent of rapidly developing single-cell sequencing technologies, which include methods related to single-cell genome, epigenome, transcriptome, and multi-omics sequencing, have been applied to cancer research and led to exciting new findings in the fields of cancer evolution, metastasis, resistance to therapy, and tumor microenvironment. In this review, we discuss recent advances and limitations of these new technologies and their potential applications in cancer studies.
39375449	2025	Nature biotechnology	Multiplexed, image-based pooled screens in primary cells and tissues with PerturbView.	Optical pooled screening (OPS) is a scalable method for linking image-based phenotypes with cellular perturbations. However, it has thus far been restricted to relatively low-plex phenotypic readouts in cancer cell lines in culture due to limitations associated with in situ sequencing of perturbation barcodes. Here, we develop PerturbView, an OPS technology that leverages in vitro transcription to amplify barcodes before in situ sequencing, enabling screens with highly multiplexed phenotypic readouts across diverse systems, including primary cells and tissues. We demonstrate PerturbView in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons, primary immune cells and tumor tissue sections from animal models. In a screen of immune signaling pathways in primary bone marrow-derived macrophages, PerturbView uncovered both known and novel regulators of NF-kappaB signaling. Furthermore, we combine PerturbView with spatial transcriptomics in tissue sections from a mouse xenograft model, paving the way to in situ screens with rich optical and transcriptomic phenotypes. PerturbView broadens the scope of OPS to a wide range of models and applications.
39535258	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Deciphering lineage-relevant gene regulatory networks during endoderm formation by InPheRNo-ChIP.	Deciphering the underlying gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that govern early human embryogenesis is critical for understanding developmental mechanisms yet remains challenging due to limited sample availability and the inherent complexity of the biological processes involved. To address this, we developed InPheRNo-ChIP, a computational framework that integrates multimodal data, including RNA-seq, transcription factor (TF)-specific ChIP-seq, and phenotypic labels, to reconstruct phenotype-relevant GRNs associated with endoderm development. The core of this method is a probabilistic graphical model that models the simultaneous effect of TFs on their putative target genes to influence a particular phenotypic outcome. Unlike the majority of existing GRN inference methods that are agnostic to the phenotypic outcomes, InPheRNo-ChIP directly incorporates phenotypic information during GRN inference, enabling the distinction between lineage-specific and general regulatory interactions. We integrated data from three experimental studies and applied InPheRNo-ChIP to infer the GRN governing the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into definitive endoderm. Benchmarking against a scRNA-seq CRISPRi study demonstrated InPheRNo-ChIP's ability to identify regulatory interactions involving endoderm markers FOXA2, SMAD2, and SOX17, outperforming other methods. This highlights the importance of incorporating the phenotypic context during network inference. Furthermore, an ablation study confirms the synergistic contribution of ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, and phenotypic data, highlighting the value of multimodal integration for accurate phenotype-relevant GRN reconstruction.
39439006	2024	Genome biology	STASCAN deciphers fine-resolution cell distribution maps in spatial transcriptomics by deep learning.	Spatial transcriptomics technologies have been widely applied to decode cellular distribution by resolving gene expression profiles in tissue. However, sequencing techniques still limit the ability to create a fine-resolved spatial cell-type map. To this end, we develop a novel deep-learning-based approach, STASCAN, to predict the spatial cellular distribution of captured or uncharted areas where only histology images are available by cell feature learning integrating gene expression profiles and histology images. STASCAN is successfully applied across diverse datasets from different spatial transcriptomics technologies and displays significant advantages in deciphering higher-resolution cellular distribution and resolving enhanced organizational structures.
37824741	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Decoding functional cell-cell communication events by multi-view graph learning on spatial transcriptomics.	Cell-cell communication events (CEs) are mediated by multiple ligand-receptor (LR) pairs. Usually only a particular subset of CEs directly works for a specific downstream response in a particular microenvironment. We name them as functional communication events (FCEs) of the target responses. Decoding FCE-target gene relations is: important for understanding the mechanisms of many biological processes, but has been intractable due to the mixing of multiple factors and the lack of direct observations. We developed a method HoloNet for decoding FCEs using spatial transcriptomic data by integrating LR pairs, cell-type spatial distribution and downstream gene expression into a deep learning model. We modeled CEs as a multi-view network, developed an attention-based graph learning method to train the model for generating target gene expression with the CE networks, and decoded the FCEs for specific downstream genes by interpreting trained models. We applied HoloNet on three Visium datasets of breast cancer and liver cancer. The results detangled the multiple factors of FCEs by revealing how LR signals and cell types affect specific biological processes, and specified FCE-induced effects in each single cell. We conducted simulation experiments and showed that HoloNet is more reliable on LR prioritization in comparison with existing methods. HoloNet is a powerful tool to illustrate cell-cell communication landscapes and reveal vital FCEs that shape cellular phenotypes. HoloNet is available as a Python package at https://github.com/lhc17/HoloNet.
38754408	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	scMNMF: a novel method for single-cell multi-omics clustering based on matrix factorization.	MOTIVATION: The technology for analyzing single-cell multi-omics data has advanced rapidly and has provided comprehensive and accurate cellular information by exploring cell heterogeneity in genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, metabolomics and proteomics data. However, because of the high-dimensional and sparse characteristics of single-cell multi-omics data, as well as the limitations of various analysis algorithms, the clustering performance is generally poor. Matrix factorization is an unsupervised, dimensionality reduction-based method that can cluster individuals and discover related omics variables from different blocks. Here, we present a novel algorithm that performs joint dimensionality reduction learning and cell clustering analysis on single-cell multi-omics data using non-negative matrix factorization that we named scMNMF. We formulate the objective function of joint learning as a constrained optimization problem and derive the corresponding iterative formulas through alternating iterative algorithms. The major advantage of the scMNMF algorithm remains its capability to explore hidden related features among omics data. Additionally, the feature selection for dimensionality reduction and cell clustering mutually influence each other iteratively, leading to a more effective discovery of cell types. We validated the performance of the scMNMF algorithm using two simulated and five real datasets. The results show that scMNMF outperformed seven other state-of-the-art algorithms in various measurements. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: scMNMF code can be found at https://github.com/yushanqiu/scMNMF.
40340906	2025	Genome biology	ZAR1 and ZAR2 orchestrate the dynamics of maternal mRNA polyadenylation during mouse oocyte development.	BACKGROUND: During meiosis, the oocyte genome keeps dormant for a long time until zygotic genome activation. The dynamics and homeostasis of the maternal transcriptome are essential for maternal-to-zygotic transition. Zygotic arrest 1 (ZAR1) and its homolog, ZAR2, are RNA-binding proteins that are important for the regulation of maternal mRNA stability. RESULTS: Smart-seq2 analysis reveals drastically downregulated maternal transcripts. However, the detection of transcript levels by Smart-seq2 may be biased by the polyadenylated tail length of the mRNAs. Similarly, differential expression of maternal transcripts in oocytes with or without Zar1/2 differs when analyzed using total RNA-seq and Smart-seq2, suggesting an influence of polyadenylation. Combined analyses using total RNA-seq, LACE-seq, PAIso-seq2, and immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry reveals that ZAR1 may target the 3'-untranslated regions of maternal transcripts, regulates their stability in germinal vesicle stage oocytes, and interacts with other proteins to control the polyadenylation of mRNAs. CONCLUSIONS: The jointly analyzed multi-omics data highlight the limitations of Smart-seq2 in oocytes, clarify the dynamics of the maternal transcriptome, and uncover new roles of ZAR1 in regulating the maternal transcriptome.
37811897	2024	Nucleic acids research	SORC: an integrated spatial omics resource in cancer.	The interactions between tumor cells and the microenvironment play pivotal roles in the initiation, progression and metastasis of cancer. The advent of spatial transcriptomics data offers an opportunity to unravel the intricate dynamics of cellular states and cell-cell interactions in cancer. Herein, we have developed an integrated spatial omics resource in cancer (SORC, http://bio-bigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/SORC), which interactively visualizes and analyzes the spatial transcriptomics data in cancer. We manually curated currently available spatial transcriptomics datasets for 17 types of cancer, comprising 722 899 spots across 269 slices. Furthermore, we matched reference single-cell RNA sequencing data in the majority of spatial transcriptomics datasets, involving 334 379 cells and 46 distinct cell types. SORC offers five major analytical modules that address the primary requirements of spatial transcriptomics analysis, including slice annotation, identification of spatially variable genes, co-occurrence of immune cells and tumor cells, functional analysis and cell-cell communications. All these spatial transcriptomics data and in-depth analyses have been integrated into easy-to-browse and explore pages, visualized through intuitive tables and various image formats. In summary, SORC serves as a valuable resource for providing an unprecedented spatially resolved cellular map of cancer and identifying specific genes and functional pathways to enhance our understanding of the tumor microenvironment.
36624151	2023	Nature biotechnology	Cell-type-specific prediction of 3D chromatin organization enables high-throughput in silico genetic screening.	Investigating how chromatin organization determines cell-type-specific gene expression remains challenging. Experimental methods for measuring three-dimensional chromatin organization, such as Hi-C, are costly and have technical limitations, restricting their broad application particularly in high-throughput genetic perturbations. We present C.Origami, a multimodal deep neural network that performs de novo prediction of cell-type-specific chromatin organization using DNA sequence and two cell-type-specific genomic features-CTCF binding and chromatin accessibility. C.Origami enables in silico experiments to examine the impact of genetic changes on chromatin interactions. We further developed an in silico genetic screening approach to assess how individual DNA elements may contribute to chromatin organization and to identify putative cell-type-specific trans-acting regulators that collectively determine chromatin architecture. Applying this approach to leukemia cells and normal T cells, we demonstrate that cell-type-specific in silico genetic screening, enabled by C.Origami, can be used to systematically discover novel chromatin regulation circuits in both normal and disease-related biological systems.
30561547	2019	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Multiomics modeling of the immunome, transcriptome, microbiome, proteome and metabolome adaptations during human pregnancy.	MOTIVATION: Multiple biological clocks govern a healthy pregnancy. These biological mechanisms produce immunologic, metabolomic, proteomic, genomic and microbiomic adaptations during the course of pregnancy. Modeling the chronology of these adaptations during full-term pregnancy provides the frameworks for future studies examining deviations implicated in pregnancy-related pathologies including preterm birth and preeclampsia. RESULTS: We performed a multiomics analysis of 51 samples from 17 pregnant women, delivering at term. The datasets included measurements from the immunome, transcriptome, microbiome, proteome and metabolome of samples obtained simultaneously from the same patients. Multivariate predictive modeling using the Elastic Net (EN) algorithm was used to measure the ability of each dataset to predict gestational age. Using stacked generalization, these datasets were combined into a single model. This model not only significantly increased predictive power by combining all datasets, but also revealed novel interactions between different biological modalities. Future work includes expansion of the cohort to preterm-enriched populations and in vivo analysis of immune-modulating interventions based on the mechanisms identified. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Datasets and scripts for reproduction of results are available through: https://nalab.stanford.edu/multiomics-pregnancy/. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
39333268	2025	Nature methods	Vitessce: integrative visualization of multimodal and spatially resolved single-cell data.	Multiomics technologies with single-cell and spatial resolution make it possible to measure thousands of features across millions of cells. However, visual analysis of high-dimensional transcriptomic, proteomic, genome-mapped and imaging data types simultaneously remains a challenge. Here we describe Vitessce, an interactive web-based visualization framework for exploration of multimodal and spatially resolved single-cell data. We demonstrate integrative visualization of millions of data points, including cell-type annotations, gene expression quantities, spatially resolved transcripts and cell segmentations, across multiple coordinated views. The open-source software is available at http://vitessce.io .
40462157	2025	Genome biology	DeepGFT: identifying spatial domains in spatial transcriptomics of complex and 3D tissue using deep learning and graph Fourier transform.	The rapid advancements in spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) enable the characterization of gene expressions while preserving spatial information. However, high dropout rates and noise hinder accurate spatial domain identification for understanding tissue architecture. We present DeepGFT, a method that simultaneously models spot-wise and gene-wise relationships by integrating deep learning with graph Fourier transform for spatial domain identification. Benchmarking results demonstrate the superiority of DeepGFT over existing methods. DeepGFT detects tumor substructures with immune-related differences in human breast cancer, identifies the complex germinal centers accurately in human lymph node, and accurately reveals the developmental changes in 3D Drosophila data.
35749559	2022	PLoS computational biology	A pipeline for the reconstruction and evaluation of context-specific human metabolic models at a large-scale.	Constraint-based (CB) metabolic models provide a mathematical framework and scaffold for in silico cell metabolism analysis and manipulation. In the past decade, significant efforts have been done to model human metabolism, enabled by the increased availability of multi-omics datasets and curated genome-scale reconstructions, as well as the development of several algorithms for context-specific model (CSM) reconstruction. Although CSM reconstruction has revealed insights on the deregulated metabolism of several pathologies, the process of reconstructing representative models of human tissues still lacks benchmarks and appropriate integrated software frameworks, since many tools required for this process are still disperse across various software platforms, some of which are proprietary. In this work, we address this challenge by assembling a scalable CSM reconstruction pipeline capable of integrating transcriptomics data in CB models. We combined omics preprocessing methods inspired by previous efforts with in-house implementations of existing CSM algorithms and new model refinement and validation routines, all implemented in the Troppo Python-based open-source framework. The pipeline was validated with multi-omics datasets from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), also including reference fluxomics measurements for the MCF7 cell line. We reconstructed over 6000 models based on the Human-GEM template model for 733 cell lines featured in the CCLE, using MCF7 models as reference to find the best parameter combinations. These reference models outperform earlier studies using the same template by comparing gene essentiality and fluxomics experiments. We also analysed the heterogeneity of breast cancer cell lines, identifying key changes in metabolism related to cancer aggressiveness. Despite the many challenges in CB modelling, we demonstrate using our pipeline that combining transcriptomics data in metabolic models can be used to investigate key metabolic shifts. Significant limitations were found on these models ability for reliable quantitative flux prediction, thus motivating further work in genome-wide phenotype prediction.
40830895	2025	Genome biology	A message passing framework for precise cell state identification with scClassify2.	Cell annotation is crucial for downstream exploration. Although many approaches, spanning from classic statistics to large language models, have been developed, most of their focus is on distinct cell types and overlook sequential cell populations. Here, we propose an annotation method, scClassify2, to specifically focus on adjacent cell state identification. By incorporating prior biological knowledge through a novel dual-layer architecture and ordinal regression, scClassify2 achieves competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Besides single-cell RNA-sequencing data, scClassify2 is generalizable from different platforms including subcellular spatial transcriptomics data. We also develop a web server for academic uses.
34725479	2021	Nature methods	Single-cell chromatin state analysis with Signac.	The recent development of experimental methods for measuring chromatin state at single-cell resolution has created a need for computational tools capable of analyzing these datasets. Here we developed Signac, a comprehensive toolkit for the analysis of single-cell chromatin data. Signac enables an end-to-end analysis of single-cell chromatin data, including peak calling, quantification, quality control, dimension reduction, clustering, integration with single-cell gene expression datasets, DNA motif analysis and interactive visualization. Through its seamless compatibility with the Seurat package, Signac facilitates the analysis of diverse multimodal single-cell chromatin data, including datasets that co-assay DNA accessibility with gene expression, protein abundance and mitochondrial genotype. We demonstrate scaling of the Signac framework to analyze datasets containing over 700,000 cells.
36192637	2023	Nature biotechnology	The expanding vistas of spatial transcriptomics.	The formation and maintenance of tissue integrity requires complex, coordinated activities by thousands of genes and their encoded products. Until recently, transcript levels could only be quantified for a few genes in tissues, but advances in DNA sequencing, oligonucleotide synthesis and fluorescence microscopy have enabled the invention of a suite of spatial transcriptomics technologies capable of measuring the expression of many, or all, genes in situ. These technologies have evolved rapidly in sensitivity, multiplexing and throughput. As such, they have enabled the determination of the cell-type architecture of tissues, the querying of cell-cell interactions and the monitoring of molecular interactions between tissue components. The rapidly evolving spatial genomics landscape will enable generalized high-throughput genomic measurements and perturbations to be performed in the context of tissues. These advances will empower hypothesis generation and biological discovery and bridge the worlds of tissue biology and genomics.
38907114	2024	Nature methods	Deciphering spatial domains from spatial multi-omics with SpatialGlue.	Advances in spatial omics technologies now allow multiple types of data to be acquired from the same tissue slice. To realize the full potential of such data, we need spatially informed methods for data integration. Here, we introduce SpatialGlue, a graph neural network model with a dual-attention mechanism that deciphers spatial domains by intra-omics integration of spatial location and omics measurement followed by cross-omics integration. We demonstrated SpatialGlue on data acquired from different tissue types using different technologies, including spatial epigenome-transcriptome and transcriptome-proteome modalities. Compared to other methods, SpatialGlue captured more anatomical details and more accurately resolved spatial domains such as the cortex layers of the brain. Our method also identified cell types like spleen macrophage subsets located at three different zones that were not available in the original data annotations. SpatialGlue scales well with data size and can be used to integrate three modalities. Our spatial multi-omics analysis tool combines the information from complementary omics modalities to obtain a holistic view of cellular and tissue properties.
40794946	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	scDCT: a conditional diffusion-based deep learning model for high-fidelity single-cell cross-modality translation.	Single-cell multi-omics technologies enable comprehensive molecular profiling, offering insights into cellular heterogeneity and biological mechanisms. However, current cross-modality translation methods struggle with high-dimensional, noisy, and sparse single-cell data. We propose single-cell Diffusion models for Cross-modality Translation (scDCT), a probabilistic framework for bidirectional cross-modality translation in single-cell data, including single-cell RNA sequencing, single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing, and protein expression. scDCT integrates modality-specific autoencoders with conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic models to map inputs to latent spaces and perform probabilistic translation across modalities. This design captures cell-type heterogeneity, accounts for data sparsity, and models uncertainty during translation. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that scDCT outperforms state-of-the-art methods across paired, unpaired, cross-type, and cross-tissue settings, offering a robust and interpretable solution for single-cell multi-omics integration.
38426323	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Adjustment of scRNA-seq data to improve cell-type decomposition of spatial transcriptomics.	Most sequencing-based spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies do not achieve single-cell resolution where each captured location (spot) may contain a mixture of cells from heterogeneous cell types, and several cell-type decomposition methods have been proposed to estimate cell type proportions of each spot by integrating with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. However, these existing methods did not fully consider the effect of distribution difference between scRNA-seq and ST data for decomposition, leading to biased cell-type-specific genes derived from scRNA-seq for ST data. To address this issue, we develop an instance-based transfer learning framework to adjust scRNA-seq data by ST data to correctly match cell-type-specific gene expression. We evaluate the effect of raw and adjusted scRNA-seq data on cell-type decomposition by eight leading decomposition methods using both simulated and real datasets. Experimental results show that data adjustment can effectively reduce distribution difference and improve decomposition, thus enabling for a more precise depiction on spatial organization of cell types. We highlight the importance of data adjustment in integrative analysis of scRNA-seq with ST data and provide guidance for improved cell-type decomposition.
37667091	2024	Nature biotechnology	Spatial multimodal analysis of transcriptomes and metabolomes in tissues.	We present a spatial omics approach that combines histology, mass spectrometry imaging and spatial transcriptomics to facilitate precise measurements of mRNA transcripts and low-molecular-weight metabolites across tissue regions. The workflow is compatible with commercially available Visium glass slides. We demonstrate the potential of our method using mouse and human brain samples in the context of dopamine and Parkinson's disease.
37965808	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	ConSpaS: a contrastive learning framework for identifying spatial domains by integrating local and global similarities.	Spatial transcriptomics is a rapidly growing field that aims to comprehensively characterize tissue organization and architecture at single-cell or sub-cellular resolution using spatial information. Such techniques provide a solid foundation for the mechanistic understanding of many biological processes in both health and disease that cannot be obtained using traditional technologies. Several methods have been proposed to decipher the spatial context of spots in tissue using spatial information. However, when spatial information and gene expression profiles are integrated, most methods only consider the local similarity of spatial information. As they do not consider the global semantic structure, spatial domain identification methods encounter poor or over-smoothed clusters. We developed ConSpaS, a novel node representation learning framework that precisely deciphers spatial domains by integrating local and global similarities based on graph autoencoder (GAE) and contrastive learning (CL). The GAE effectively integrates spatial information using local similarity and gene expression profiles, thereby ensuring that cluster assignment is spatially continuous. To improve the characterization of the global similarity of gene expression data, we adopt CL to consider the global semantic information. We propose an augmentation-free mechanism to construct global positive samples and use a semi-easy sampling strategy to define negative samples. We validated ConSpaS on multiple tissue types and technology platforms by comparing it with existing typical methods. The experimental results confirmed that ConSpaS effectively improved the identification accuracy of spatial domains with biologically meaningful spatial patterns, and denoised gene expression data while maintaining the spatial expression pattern. Furthermore, our proposed method better depicted the spatial trajectory by integrating local and global similarities.
37996937	2023	Genome biology	"Multi-omics analysis reveals the molecular response to heat stress in a ""red tide"" dinoflagellate."	"BACKGROUND: ""Red tides"" are harmful algal blooms caused by dinoflagellate microalgae that accumulate toxins lethal to other organisms, including humans via consumption of contaminated seafood. These algal blooms are driven by a combination of environmental factors including nutrient enrichment, particularly in warm waters, and are increasingly frequent. The molecular, regulatory, and evolutionary mechanisms that underlie the heat stress response in these harmful bloom-forming algal species remain little understood, due in part to the limited genomic resources from dinoflagellates, complicated by the large sizes of genomes, exhibiting features atypical of eukaryotes. RESULTS: We present the de novo assembled genome (~ 4.75 Gbp with 85,849 protein-coding genes), transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome from Prorocentrum cordatum, a globally abundant, bloom-forming dinoflagellate. Using axenic algal cultures, we study the molecular mechanisms that underpin the algal response to heat stress, which is relevant to current ocean warming trends. We present the first evidence of a complementary interplay between RNA editing and exon usage that regulates the expression and functional diversity of biomolecules, reflected by reduction in photosynthesis, central metabolism, and protein synthesis. These results reveal genomic signatures and post-transcriptional regulation for the first time in a pelagic dinoflagellate. CONCLUSIONS: Our multi-omics analyses uncover the molecular response to heat stress in an important bloom-forming algal species, which is driven by complex gene structures in a large, high-G+C genome, combined with multi-level transcriptional regulation. The dynamics and interplay of molecular regulatory mechanisms may explain in part how dinoflagellates diversified to become some of the most ecologically successful organisms on Earth."
35130273	2022	PLoS computational biology	INTEGRATE: Model-based multi-omics data integration to characterize multi-level metabolic regulation.	Metabolism is directly and indirectly fine-tuned by a complex web of interacting regulatory mechanisms that fall into two major classes. On the one hand, the expression level of the catalyzing enzyme sets the maximal theoretical flux level (i.e., the net rate of the reaction) for each enzyme-controlled reaction. On the other hand, metabolic regulation controls the metabolic flux through the interactions of metabolites (substrates, cofactors, allosteric modulators) with the responsible enzyme. High-throughput data, such as metabolomics and transcriptomics data, if analyzed separately, do not accurately characterize the hierarchical regulation of metabolism outlined above. They must be integrated to disassemble the interdependence between different regulatory layers controlling metabolism. To this aim, we propose INTEGRATE, a computational pipeline that integrates metabolomics and transcriptomics data, using constraint-based stoichiometric metabolic models as a scaffold. We compute differential reaction expression from transcriptomics data and use constraint-based modeling to predict if the differential expression of metabolic enzymes directly originates differences in metabolic fluxes. In parallel, we use metabolomics to predict how differences in substrate availability translate into differences in metabolic fluxes. We discriminate fluxes regulated at the metabolic and/or gene expression level by intersecting these two output datasets. We demonstrate the pipeline using a set of immortalized normal and cancer breast cell lines. In a clinical setting, knowing the regulatory level at which a given metabolic reaction is controlled will be valuable to inform targeted, truly personalized therapies in cancer patients.
34425882	2021	Genome biology	INFIMA leverages multi-omics model organism data to identify effector genes of human GWAS variants.	Genome-wide association studies reveal many non-coding variants associated with complex traits. However, model organism studies largely remain as an untapped resource for unveiling the effector genes of non-coding variants. We develop INFIMA, Integrative Fine-Mapping, to pinpoint causal SNPs for diversity outbred (DO) mice eQTL by integrating founder mice multi-omics data including ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, footprinting, and in silico mutation analysis. We demonstrate INFIMA's superior performance compared to alternatives with human and mouse chromatin conformation capture datasets. We apply INFIMA to identify novel effector genes for GWAS variants associated with diabetes. The results of the application are available at http://www.statlab.wisc.edu/shiny/INFIMA/ .
38037084	2023	Genome biology	STmut: a framework for visualizing somatic alterations in spatial transcriptomics data of cancer.	Spatial transcriptomic technologies, such as the Visium platform, measure gene expression in different regions of tissues. Here, we describe new software, STmut, to visualize somatic point mutations, allelic imbalance, and copy number alterations in Visium data. STmut is tested on fresh-frozen Visium data, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) Visium data, and tumors with and without matching DNA sequencing data. Copy number is inferred on all conditions, but the chemistry of the FFPE platform does not permit analyses of single nucleotide variants. Taken together, we propose solutions to add the genetic dimension to spatial transcriptomic data and describe the limitations of different datatypes.
37253698	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Spatially aware self-representation learning for tissue structure characterization and spatial functional genes identification.	Spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) enable the comprehensive characterization of transcriptomic profiles in the context of tissue microenvironments. Unveiling spatial transcriptional heterogeneity needs to effectively incorporate spatial information accounting for the substantial spatial correlation of expression measurements. Here, we develop a computational method, SpaSRL (spatially aware self-representation learning), which flexibly enhances and decodes spatial transcriptional signals to simultaneously achieve spatial domain detection and spatial functional genes identification. This novel tunable spatially aware strategy of SpaSRL not only balances spatial and transcriptional coherence for the two tasks, but also can transfer spatial correlation constraint between them based on a unified model. In addition, this joint analysis by SpaSRL deciphers accurate and fine-grained tissue structures and ensures the effective extraction of biologically informative genes underlying spatial architecture. We verified the superiority of SpaSRL on spatial domain detection, spatial functional genes identification and data denoising using multiple SRT datasets obtained by different platforms and tissue sections. Our results illustrate SpaSRL's utility in flexible integration of spatial information and novel discovery of biological insights from spatial transcriptomic datasets.
33589836	2021	Nature methods	Joint profiling of histone modifications and transcriptome in single cells from mouse brain.	Genome-wide profiling of histone modifications can reveal not only the location and activity state of regulatory elements, but also the regulatory mechanisms involved in cell-type-specific gene expression during development and disease pathology. Conventional assays to profile histone modifications in bulk tissues lack single-cell resolution. Here we describe an ultra-high-throughput method, Paired-Tag, for joint profiling of histone modifications and transcriptome in single cells to produce cell-type-resolved maps of chromatin state and transcriptome in complex tissues. We used this method to profile five histone modifications jointly with transcriptome in the adult mouse frontal cortex and hippocampus. Integrative analysis of the resulting maps identified distinct groups of genes subject to divergent epigenetic regulatory mechanisms. Our single-cell multiomics approach enables comprehensive analysis of chromatin state and gene regulation in complex tissues and characterization of gene regulatory programs in the constituent cell types.
40247122	2025	Nature methods	scMultiSim: simulation of single-cell multi-omics and spatial data guided by gene regulatory networks and cell-cell interactions.	Simulated single-cell data are essential for designing and evaluating computational methods in the absence of experimental ground truth. Here we present scMultiSim, a comprehensive simulator that generates multimodal single-cell data encompassing gene expression, chromatin accessibility, RNA velocity and spatial cell locations while accounting for the relationships between modalities. Unlike existing tools that focus on limited biological factors, scMultiSim simultaneously models cell identity, gene regulatory networks, cell-cell interactions and chromatin accessibility while incorporating technical noise. Moreover, it allows users to adjust each factor's effect easily. Here we show that scMultiSim generates data with expected biological effects, and demonstrate its applications by benchmarking a wide range of computational tasks, including multimodal and multi-batch data integration, RNA velocity estimation, gene regulatory network inference and cell-cell interaction inference using spatially resolved gene expression data. Compared to existing simulators, scMultiSim can benchmark a much broader range of existing computational problems and even new potential tasks.
40205439	2025	Genome biology	Filtering cells with high mitochondrial content depletes viable metabolically altered malignant cell populations in cancer single-cell studies.	BACKGROUND: Single-cell transcriptomics has transformed our understanding of cellular diversity, yet noise from technical artifacts and low-quality cells can obscure key biological signals. A common practice is filtering out cells with a high percentage of mitochondrial RNA counts (pctMT), typically indicative of cell death. However, commonly used filtering thresholds, primarily derived from studies on healthy tissues, may be overly stringent for malignant cells, which often naturally exhibit higher baseline mitochondrial gene expression. RESULTS: We examine nine public single-cell RNA-seq datasets from various cancers, including 441,445 cells from 134 patients, and public spatial transcriptomics data, assessing the viability of malignant cells with high pctMT. Our analysis reveals that malignant cells exhibit significantly higher pctMT than nonmalignant cells, without a notable increase in dissociation-induced stress scores. Malignant cells with high pctMT show metabolic dysregulation, including increased xenobiotic metabolism, relevant to therapeutic response. Analysis of pctMT in cancer cell lines further reveals links to drug resistance. We also observe associations between pctMT and malignant cell transcriptional heterogeneity, as well as patient clinical features. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides insights into the functional characteristics of malignant cells with elevated pctMT, challenging current quality control practices in tumor single-cell RNA-seq analyses and offering potential improvements in data interpretation for future cancer studies.
38145948	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	THItoGene: a deep learning method for predicting spatial transcriptomics from histological images.	Spatial transcriptomics unveils the complex dynamics of cell regulation and transcriptomes, but it is typically cost-prohibitive. Predicting spatial gene expression from histological images via artificial intelligence offers a more affordable option, yet existing methods fall short in extracting deep-level information from pathological images. In this paper, we present THItoGene, a hybrid neural network that utilizes dynamic convolutional and capsule networks to adaptively sense potential molecular signals in histological images for exploring the relationship between high-resolution pathology image phenotypes and regulation of gene expression. A comprehensive benchmark evaluation using datasets from human breast cancer and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma has demonstrated the superior performance of THItoGene in spatial gene expression prediction. Moreover, THItoGene has demonstrated its capacity to decipher both the spatial context and enrichment signals within specific tissue regions. THItoGene can be freely accessed at https://github.com/yrjia1015/THItoGene.
33627474	2021	Genome research	Multimodal single-cell/nucleus RNA sequencing data analysis uncovers molecular networks between disease-associated microglia and astrocytes with implications for drug repurposing in Alzheimer's disease.	Because disease-associated microglia (DAM) and disease-associated astrocytes (DAA) are involved in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), we systematically identified molecular networks between DAM and DAA to uncover novel therapeutic targets for AD. Specifically, we develop a network-based methodology that leverages single-cell/nucleus RNA sequencing data from both transgenic mouse models and AD patient brains, as well as drug-target network, metabolite-enzyme associations, the human protein-protein interactome, and large-scale longitudinal patient data. Through this approach, we find both common and unique gene network regulators between DAM (i.e., PAK1, MAPK14, and CSF1R) and DAA (i.e., NFKB1, FOS, and JUN) that are significantly enriched by neuro-inflammatory pathways and well-known genetic variants (i.e., BIN1). We identify shared immune pathways between DAM and DAA, including Th17 cell differentiation and chemokine signaling. Last, integrative metabolite-enzyme network analyses suggest that fatty acids and amino acids may trigger molecular alterations in DAM and DAA. Combining network-based prediction and retrospective case-control observations with 7.2 million individuals, we identify that usage of fluticasone (an approved glucocorticoid receptor agonist) is significantly associated with a reduced incidence of AD (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.83-0.89, P < 1.0 x 10(-8)). Propensity score-stratified cohort studies reveal that usage of mometasone (a stronger glucocorticoid receptor agonist) is significantly associated with a decreased risk of AD (HR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.68-0.81, P < 1.0 x 10(-8)) compared to fluticasone after adjusting age, gender, and disease comorbidities. In summary, we present a network-based, multimodal methodology for single-cell/nucleus genomics-informed drug discovery and have identified fluticasone and mometasone as potential treatments in AD.
36864748	2023	Nucleic acids research	HPV integration generates a cellular super-enhancer which functions as ecDNA to regulate genome-wide transcription.	Human papillomavirus (HPV) integration is a critical step in cervical cancer development; however, the oncogenic mechanism at the genome-wide transcriptional level is still poorly understood. In this study, we employed integrative analysis on multi-omics data of six HPV-positive and three HPV-negative cell lines. Through HPV integration detection, super-enhancer (SE) identification, SE-associated gene expression and extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) investigation, we aimed to explore the genome-wide transcriptional influence of HPV integration. We identified seven high-ranking cellular SEs generated by HPV integration in total (the HPV breakpoint-induced cellular SEs, BP-cSEs), leading to intra-chromosomal and inter-chromosomal regulation of chromosomal genes. The pathway analysis revealed that the dysregulated chromosomal genes were correlated to cancer-related pathways. Importantly, we demonstrated that BP-cSEs existed in the HPV-human hybrid ecDNAs, explaining the above transcriptional alterations. Our results suggest that HPV integration generates cellular SEs that function as ecDNA to regulate unconstrained transcription, expanding the tumorigenic mechanism of HPV integration and providing insights for developing new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
41171146	2025	Nucleic acids research	connectomeDB2025: a rigorously curated, multi-species resource of experimentally supported ligand-receptor interactions.	"Inferring cell-cell communication networks is now a cornerstone of single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data analysis, relying critically on reference catalogues of experimentally supported ligand-receptor interactions. Here, we present the updated, rigorously curated connectomeDB, an open-access database of peptide-based ligand-receptor pairs comprising 3579 vertebrate interactions supported by primary experimental evidence from 2803 research articles. By critically reviewing all putative ligand-receptor pairs from connectomeDB2020, CellChatDB v2, CellPhoneDB v5, CellTalkDB, ICELLNET v2, and LIANA+, we first removed over 2900 misclassified or unsupported interactions lacking primary-literature evidence. We then expanded the resulting verified dataset through AI-assisted literature mining and manual curation, adding 827 pairs and 718 supporting articles absent from other databases, including 264 pairs first described since 2020. connectomeDB2025 contains 5429 evidence links (""triplets""), each connecting a ligand-receptor pair to a specific publication, collectively providing at least one source of primary experimental evidence for each interaction. Notably, 2359 of these triplets are exclusive to connectomeDB2025, making it the most robustly supported ligand-receptor database with primary experimental evidence. The online resource (https://connectomedb.org) provides searchable, downloadable ligand-receptor lists and detailed pair summaries, enabling accurate cell-cell communication analysis across human, mouse, and 12 other vertebrate species."
37933857	2024	Nucleic acids research	PPGR: a comprehensive perennial plant genomes and regulation database.	Perennial woody plants hold vital ecological significance, distinguished by their unique traits. While significant progress has been made in their genomic and functional studies, a major challenge persists: the absence of a comprehensive reference platform for collection, integration and in-depth analysis of the vast amount of data. Here, we present PPGR (Resource for Perennial Plant Genomes and Regulation; https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/ppgr/) to address this critical gap, by collecting, integrating, analyzing and visualizing genomic, gene regulation and functional data of perennial plants. PPGR currently includes 60 species, 847 million protein-protein/TF (transcription factor)-target interactions, 9016 transcriptome samples under various environmental conditions and genetic backgrounds. Noteworthy is the focus on genes that regulate wood production, seasonal dormancy, terpene biosynthesis and leaf senescence representing a wealth of information derived from experimental data, literature mining, public databases and genomic predictions. Furthermore, PPGR incorporates a range of multi-omics search and analysis tools to facilitate browsing and application of these extensive datasets. PPGR represents a comprehensive and high-quality resource for perennial plants, substantiated by an illustrative case study that demonstrates its capacity in unraveling gene functions and shedding light on potential regulatory processes.
26072472	2015	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	MSProGene: integrative proteogenomics beyond six-frames and single nucleotide polymorphisms.	Ongoing advances in high-throughput technologies have facilitated accurate proteomic measurements and provide a wealth of information on genomic and transcript level. In proteogenomics, this multi-omics data is combined to analyze unannotated organisms and to allow more accurate sample-specific predictions. Existing analysis methods still mainly depend on six-frame translations or reference protein databases that are extended by transcriptomic information or known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). However, six-frames introduce an artificial sixfold increase of the target database and SNP integration requires a suitable database summarizing results from previous experiments. We overcome these limitations by introducing MSProGene, a new method for integrative proteogenomic analysis based on customized RNA-Seq driven transcript databases. MSProGene is independent from existing reference databases or annotated SNPs and avoids large six-frame translated databases by constructing sample-specific transcripts. In addition, it creates a network combining RNA-Seq and peptide information that is optimized by a maximum-flow algorithm. It thereby also allows resolving the ambiguity of shared peptides for protein inference. We applied MSProGene on three datasets and show that it facilitates a database-independent reliable yet accurate prediction on gene and protein level and additionally identifies novel genes. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: MSProGene is written in Java and Python. It is open source and available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/msprogene/.
40874818	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Deep learning-driven multi-omics analysis: enhancing cancer diagnostics and therapeutics.	Artificial intelligence (AI) excels at efficiently processing large volumes of data and extracting valuable insights. Deep Learning (DL), a subfield of AI, utilizes multi-layer neural network algorithms to analyze various types of data, mimicking the neural network architecture of the human brain. One of the most prominent features of DL is its end-to-end learning mechanism, which excels at automatic feature extraction and pattern recognition in data. As multi-omics technologies rapidly evolve, the volume of omics data from cancer samples has surged, presenting a significant challenge in managing this vast amount of information. Due to its strong data processing capabilities, DL is increasingly applied across a range of cancer research areas, such as early detection and screening, diagnosis, molecular subtype classification, discovery of biomarkers, and predicting patient prognosis and treatment responses. DL integrates high-dimensional data from fields such as genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, radiomics, and single-cell omics, enhancing our understanding of cancer development and advancing personalized treatment approaches. This paper reviews various DL models and their roles in analyzing complex data patterns, providing a review of DL applications in cancer multi-omics analysis research and emphasizing its potential in early detection, diagnosis, classification, and prognosis prediction. As DL models are introduced continuously, we expect their application in cancer research to become more extensive, thus propelling the advancement of cancer medicine.
34185062	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	BioVLAB-Cancer-Pharmacogenomics: tumor heterogeneity and pharmacogenomics analysis of multi-omics data from tumor on the cloud.	MOTIVATION: Multi-omics data in molecular biology has accumulated rapidly over the years. Such data contains valuable information for research in medicine and drug discovery. Unfortunately, data-driven research in medicine and drug discovery is challenging for a majority of small research labs due to the large volume of data and the complexity of analysis pipeline. RESULTS: We present BioVLAB-Cancer-Pharmacogenomics, a bioinformatics system that facilitates analysis of multi-omics data from breast cancer to analyze and investigate intratumor heterogeneity and pharmacogenomics on Amazon Web Services. Our system takes multi-omics data as input to perform tumor heterogeneity analysis in terms of TCGA data and deconvolve-and-match the tumor gene expression to cell line data in CCLE using DNA methylation profiles. We believe that our system can help small research labs perform analysis of tumor multi-omics without worrying about computational infrastructure and maintenance of databases and tools.

40728857	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Dynamic changes of synergy relationship between lncRNA and immune checkpoint in cancer progression.	In the battle between tumors and the immune system, immune evasion based on immune checkpoints (ICPs) is a critical mechanism for tumor progression. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are key players in tumorigenesis and immune responses; however, the mechanisms underlying the synergistic relationship between lncRNAs and ICPs in cancer progression remain poorly understood. Manually curated ICPs and high-confidence lncRNA-messenger RNA (mRNA) interactions were integrated via a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network to construct an initial set of lncRNA-ICP pairs. Stage-specific synergy scores were then performed and used to identify stage-specific synergistic pairs for each cancer type. Our findings indicate that several key genes, including MALAT1 and CRNDE, are widely involved in cancer progression and exhibit various patterns in multiple cancers. Genes within the lncRNA-ICP synergy network were associated with the dynamic changes of immune cells during cancer progression, and these relationships remain relatively stable across different cancers and stages. The relationships of the synergistic pairs we identified demonstrate consistency with spatial transcriptomics data in skin cutaneous melanoma. Notably, the overall expression of genes identified in Stage 4 could significantly differentiate patients' survival outcomes. Moreover, the genes we identified could distinguish patients' responses to immunotherapy.
30423084	2018	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	iTOP: inferring the topology of omics data.	MOTIVATION: In biology, we are often faced with multiple datasets recorded on the same set of objects, such as multi-omics and phenotypic data of the same tumors. These datasets are typically not independent from each other. For example, methylation may influence gene expression, which may, in turn, influence drug response. Such relationships can strongly affect analyses performed on the data, as we have previously shown for the identification of biomarkers of drug response. Therefore, it is important to be able to chart the relationships between datasets. RESULTS: We present iTOP, a methodology to infer a topology of relationships between datasets. We base this methodology on the RV coefficient, a measure of matrix correlation, which can be used to determine how much information is shared between two datasets. We extended the RV coefficient for partial matrix correlations, which allows the use of graph reconstruction algorithms, such as the PC algorithm, to infer the topologies. In addition, since multi-omics data often contain binary data (e.g. mutations), we also extended the RV coefficient for binary data. Applying iTOP to pharmacogenomics data, we found that gene expression acts as a mediator between most other datasets and drug response: only proteomics clearly shares information with drug response that is not present in gene expression. Based on this result, we used TANDEM, a method for drug response prediction, to identify which variables predictive of drug response were distinct to either gene expression or proteomics. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: An implementation of our methodology is available in the R package iTOP on CRAN. Additionally, an R Markdown document with code to reproduce all figures is provided as Supplementary Material. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
38859767	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Multi-omic analysis tools for microbial metabolites prediction.	How to resolve the metabolic dark matter of microorganisms has long been a challenging problem in discovering active molecules. Diverse omics tools have been developed to guide the discovery and characterization of various microbial metabolites, which make it gradually possible to predict the overall metabolites for individual strains. The combinations of multi-omic analysis tools effectively compensates for the shortcomings of current studies that focus only on single omics or a broad class of metabolites. In this review, we systematically update, categorize and sort out different analysis tools for microbial metabolites prediction in the last five years to appeal for the multi-omic combination on the understanding of the metabolic nature of microbes. First, we provide the general survey on different updated prediction databases, webservers, or software that based on genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, respectively. Then, we discuss the essentiality on the integration of multi-omics data to predict metabolites of different microbial strains and communities, as well as stressing the combination of other techniques, such as systems biology methods and data-driven algorithms. Finally, we identify key challenges and trends in developing multi-omic analysis tools for more comprehensive prediction on diverse microbial metabolites that contribute to human health and disease treatment.

Moreover, CROST integrates the transcriptome, epigenome, and genome to explore tumor-associated SVGs and provides a comprehensive understanding of their roles in cancer progression and prognosis. Furthermore, CROST provides two online tools, single-sample gene set enrichment analysis and SpatialAP, for users to annotate and analyze the uploaded spatial transcriptomics data. The user-friendly interface of CROST facilitates browsing, searching, analyzing, visualizing, and downloading desired information. Collectively, CROST offers fresh and comprehensive insights into tissue structure and a foundation for understanding multiple biological mechanisms in diseases, particularly in tumor tissues.
33351794	2020	PLoS computational biology	CHOmics: A web-based tool for multi-omics data analysis and interactive visualization in CHO cell lines.	Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines are widely used in industry for biological drug production. During cell culture development, considerable effort is invested to understand the factors that greatly impact cell growth, specific productivity and product qualities of the biotherapeutics. While high-throughput omics approaches have been increasingly utilized to reveal cellular mechanisms associated with cell line phenotypes and guide process optimization, comprehensive omics data analysis and management have been a challenge. Here we developed CHOmics, a web-based tool for integrative analysis of CHO cell line omics data that provides an interactive visualization of omics analysis outputs and efficient data management. CHOmics has a built-in comprehensive pipeline for RNA sequencing data processing and multi-layer statistical modules to explore relevant genes or pathways. Moreover, advanced functionalities were provided to enable users to customize their analysis and visualize the output systematically and interactively. The tool was also designed with the flexibility to accommodate other types of omics data and thereby enabling multi-omics comparison and visualization at both gene and pathway levels. Collectively, CHOmics is an integrative platform for data analysis, visualization and management with expectations to promote the broader use of omics in CHO cell research.
38783355	2024	Genome biology	MNMST: topology of cell networks leverages identification of spatial domains from spatial transcriptomics data.	Advances in spatial transcriptomics provide an unprecedented opportunity to reveal the structure and function of biology systems. However, current algorithms fail to address the heterogeneity and interpretability of spatial transcriptomics data. Here, we present a multi-layer network model for identifying spatial domains in spatial transcriptomics data with joint learning. We demonstrate that spatial domains can be precisely characterized and discriminated by the topological structure of cell networks, facilitating identification and interpretability of spatial domains, which outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we prove that network model offers an effective and efficient strategy for integrative analysis of spatial transcriptomics data from various platforms.
40639417	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	TriCLFF: a multi-modal feature fusion framework using contrastive learning for spatial domain identification.	Spatial transcriptomics (ST) encompasses rich multi-modal information related to cell state and organization. Precisely identifying spatial domains with consistent gene expression patterns and histological features is a critical task in ST analysis, which requires comprehensive integration of multi-modal information. Here, we propose TriCLFF, a contrastive learning-based multi-modal feature fusion framework, to effectively integrate spatial associations, gene expression levels, and histological features in a unified manner. Leveraging an advanced feature fusion mechanism, our proposed TriCLFF framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and robustness across four datasets (mouse brain anterior, mouse olfactory bulb, human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and human breast cancer) from different platforms (10x Visium and Stereo-seq) for spatial domain identification. TriCLFF also facilitates the identification of finer-grained structures in breast cancer tissues and detects previously unknown gene expression patterns in the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, providing novel insights for understanding tissue functions. Overall, TriCLFF establishes an effective paradigm for integrating spatial multi-modal data, demonstrating its potential for advancing ST research. The source code of TriCLFF is available online at https://github.com/HBZZ168/TriCLFF.
37314966	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Ensemble deep learning of embeddings for clustering multimodal single-cell omics data.	MOTIVATION: Recent advances in multimodal single-cell omics technologies enable multiple modalities of molecular attributes, such as gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and protein abundance, to be profiled simultaneously at a global level in individual cells. While the increasing availability of multiple data modalities is expected to provide a more accurate clustering and characterization of cells, the development of computational methods that are capable of extracting information embedded across data modalities is still in its infancy. RESULTS: We propose SnapCCESS for clustering cells by integrating data modalities in multimodal single-cell omics data using an unsupervised ensemble deep learning framework. By creating snapshots of embeddings of multimodality using variational autoencoders, SnapCCESS can be coupled with various clustering algorithms for generating consensus clustering of cells. We applied SnapCCESS with several clustering algorithms to various datasets generated from popular multimodal single-cell omics technologies. Our results demonstrate that SnapCCESS is effective and more efficient than conventional ensemble deep learning-based clustering methods and outperforms other state-of-the-art multimodal embedding generation methods in integrating data modalities for clustering cells. The improved clustering of cells from SnapCCESS will pave the way for more accurate characterization of cell identity and types, an essential step for various downstream analyses of multimodal single-cell omics data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: SnapCCESS is implemented as a Python package and is freely available from https://github.com/PYangLab/SnapCCESS under the open-source license of GPL-3. The data used in this study are publicly available (see section 'Data availability').
38915088	2024	Genome biology	scHolography: a computational method for single-cell spatial neighborhood reconstruction and analysis.	Spatial transcriptomics has transformed our ability to study tissue complexity. However, it remains challenging to accurately dissect tissue organization at single-cell resolution. Here we introduce scHolography, a machine learning-based method designed to reconstruct single-cell spatial neighborhoods and facilitate 3D tissue visualization using spatial and single-cell RNA sequencing data. scHolography employs a high-dimensional transcriptome-to-space projection that infers spatial relationships among cells, defining spatial neighborhoods and enhancing analyses of cell-cell communication. When applied to both human and mouse datasets, scHolography enables quantitative assessments of spatial cell neighborhoods, cell-cell interactions, and tumor-immune microenvironment. Together, scHolography offers a robust computational framework for elucidating 3D tissue organization and analyzing spatial dynamics at the cellular level.
35604082	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	webSCST: an interactive web application for single-cell RNA-sequencing data and spatial transcriptomic data integration.	SUMMARY: Integrative analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data with spatial data for the same species and organ would provide each cell sample with a predictive spatial location, which would facilitate biological study. However, publicly available spatial sequencing datasets for specific species and organs are rare and are often displayed in different formats. In this study, we introduce a new web-based scRNA-seq analysis tool, webSCST, that integrates well-organized spatial transcriptome sequencing datasets categorized by species and organs, provides a user-friendly interface for raw single-cell processing with popular integration methods and allows users to submit their raw scRNA-seq data once to obtain predicted spatial locations for each cell type.

34154649	2021	Genome biology	SPARK-X: non-parametric modeling enables scalable and robust detection of spatial expression patterns for large spatial transcriptomic studies.	Spatial transcriptomic studies are becoming increasingly common and large, posing important statistical and computational challenges for many analytic tasks. Here, we present SPARK-X, a non-parametric method for rapid and effective detection of spatially expressed genes in large spatial transcriptomic studies. SPARK-X not only produces effective type I error control and high power but also brings orders of magnitude computational savings. We apply SPARK-X to analyze three large datasets, one of which is only analyzable by SPARK-X. In these data, SPARK-X identifies many spatially expressed genes including those that are spatially expressed within the same cell type, revealing new biological insights.
41118512	2025	Nucleic acids research	MouseOmics: a multi-omics database for mouse biological study.	Mouse represents a pivotal model and indispensable resource in medical and life sciences, widely used for developmental biology and multi-omics studies. Yet, a comprehensive, integrated mouse multi-omics database remains lacking. Here, we established a mouse multi-omics database, MouseOmics, by integrating 21 genomes distributed among five species within the genus Mus, transcriptomes in 584 tissue samples, proteomes in 285 tissue samples, metabolomes in 143 tissue samples, metallomes in 296 tissue samples, and three variomes covering 52 mouse inbred strains. All mouse multi-omics data can be explored through multiple functional modules with user-friendly web interface. Furthermore, we embedded several useful tools, like MISAweb, for the identification of microsatellite DNAs, and specifically developed the enrichment analysis modules of InterPro, Gene Ontology, and Pathway for mouse. The mouse multi-omics data can be downloaded online conveniently. MouseOmics will be updated regularly with the newly released mouse multi-omics data and can be accessed freely via the address https://www.varnatech.cn/MouseOmics.
40781324	2025	Genome biology	LSGI: interpretable spatial gradient analysis for spatial transcriptomics data.	Cellular anatomy and signaling vary across niches, which can induce gradated gene expressions in subpopulations of cells. Such spatial transcriptomic gradient (STG) makes a significant source of intra-tumor heterogeneity. We present Local Spatial Gradient Inference (LSGI), a computational framework that systematically identifies spatial locations with prominent, interpretable STGs from spatial transcriptomic (ST) data. We demonstrate LSGI in tumor ST datasets and identify pan-cancer and tumor-type specific pathways with gradated patterns, highlighting the ones related to spatial transcriptional intratumoral heterogeneity. LSGI enables interpretable STG analysis, which can reveal novel insights in tumor biology from the increasingly reported tumor ST datasets.
38295113	2024	PLoS computational biology	Statistical integration of multi-omics and drug screening data from cell lines.	Data integration methods are used to obtain a unified summary of multiple datasets. For multi-modal data, we propose a computational workflow to jointly analyze datasets from cell lines. The workflow comprises a novel probabilistic data integration method, named POPLS-DA, for multi-omics data. The workflow is motivated by a study on synucleinopathies where transcriptomics, proteomics, and drug screening data are measured in affected LUHMES cell lines and controls. The aim is to highlight potentially druggable pathways and genes involved in synucleinopathies. First, POPLS-DA is used to prioritize genes and proteins that best distinguish cases and controls. For these genes, an integrated interaction network is constructed where the drug screen data is incorporated to highlight druggable genes and pathways in the network. Finally, functional enrichment analyses are performed to identify clusters of synaptic and lysosome-related genes and proteins targeted by the protective drugs. POPLS-DA is compared to other single- and multi-omics approaches. We found that HSPA5, a member of the heat shock protein 70 family, was one of the most targeted genes by the validated drugs, in particular by AT1-blockers. HSPA5 and AT1-blockers have been previously linked to alpha-synuclein pathology and Parkinson's disease, showing the relevance of our findings. Our computational workflow identified new directions for therapeutic targets for synucleinopathies. POPLS-DA provided a larger interpretable gene set than other single- and multi-omic approaches. An implementation based on R and markdown is freely available online.
38676948	2024	Nucleic acids research	SpatialSPM: statistical parametric mapping for the comparison of gene expression pattern images in multiple spatial transcriptomic datasets.	Spatial transcriptomic (ST) techniques help us understand the gene expression levels in specific parts of tissues and organs, providing insights into their biological functions. Even though ST dataset provides information on the gene expression and its location for each sample, it is challenging to compare spatial gene expression patterns across tissue samples with different shapes and coordinates. Here, we propose a method, SpatialSPM, that reconstructs ST data into multi-dimensional image matrices to ensure comparability across different samples through spatial registration process. We demonstrated the applicability of this method by kidney and mouse olfactory bulb datasets as well as mouse brain ST datasets to investigate and directly compare gene expression in a specific anatomical region of interest, pixel by pixel, across various biological statuses. Beyond traditional analyses, SpatialSPM is capable of generating statistical parametric maps, including T-scores and Pearson correlation coefficients. This feature enables the identification of specific regions exhibiting differentially expressed genes across tissue samples, enhancing the depth and specificity of ST studies. Our approach provides an efficient way to analyze ST datasets and may offer detailed insights into various biological conditions.
34655292	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	sciCNV: high-throughput paired profiling of transcriptomes and DNA copy number variations at single-cell resolution.	Chromosome copy number variations (CNVs) are a near-universal feature of cancer; however, their individual effects on cellular function are often incompletely understood. Single-cell ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing (scRNA-seq) might be leveraged to reveal the function of intra-clonal CNVs; however, it cannot directly link cellular gene expression to CNVs. Here, we report a high-throughput scRNA-seq analysis pipeline that provides paired CNV profiles and transcriptomes for single cells, enabling exploration of the effects of CNVs on cellular programs. RTAM1 and -2 normalization methods are described, and are shown to improve transcriptome alignment between cells, increasing the sensitivity of scRNA-seq for CNV detection. We also report single-cell inferred chromosomal copy number variation (sciCNV), a tool for inferring single-cell CNVs from scRNA-seq at 19-46 Mb resolution. Comparison of sciCNV with existing RNA-based CNV methods reveals useful advances in sensitivity and specificity. Using sciCNV, we demonstrate that scRNA-seq can be used to examine the cellular effects of cancer CNVs. As an example, sciCNV is used to identify subclonal multiple myeloma (MM) cells with +8q22-24. Studies of the gene expression of intra-clonal MM cells with and without the CNV demonstrate that +8q22-24 upregulates MYC and MYC-target genes, messenger RNA processing and protein synthesis, which is consistent with established models. In conclusion, we provide new tools for scRNA-seq that enable paired profiling of the CNVs and transcriptomes of single cells, facilitating rapid and accurate deconstruction of the effects of cancer CNVs on cellular programming.
38940176	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Deciphering high-order structures in spatial transcriptomes with graph-guided Tucker decomposition.	Spatial transcripome (ST) profiling can reveal cells' structural organizations and functional roles in tissues. However, deciphering the spatial context of gene expressions in ST data is a challenge-the high-order structure hiding in whole transcriptome space over 2D/3D spatial coordinates requires modeling and detection of interpretable high-order elements and components for further functional analysis and interpretation. This paper presents a new method GraphTucker-graph-regularized Tucker tensor decomposition for learning high-order factorization in ST data. GraphTucker is based on a nonnegative Tucker decomposition algorithm regularized by a high-order graph that captures spatial relation among spots and functional relation among genes. In the experiments on several Visium and Stereo-seq datasets, the novelty and advantage of modeling multiway multilinear relationships among the components in Tucker decomposition are demonstrated as opposed to the Canonical Polyadic Decomposition and conventional matrix factorization models by evaluation of detecting spatial components of gene modules, clustering spatial coefficients for tissue segmentation and imputing complete spatial transcriptomes. The results of visualization show strong evidence that GraphTucker detect more interpretable spatial components in the context of the spatial domains in the tissues. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: https://github.com/kuanglab/GraphTucker.
27150809	2016	Nucleic acids research	KeyPathwayMinerWeb: online multi-omics network enrichment.	We present KeyPathwayMinerWeb, the first online platform for de novo pathway enrichment analysis directly in the browser. Given a biological interaction network (e.g. protein-protein interactions) and a series of molecular profiles derived from one or multiple OMICS studies (gene expression, for instance), KeyPathwayMiner extracts connected sub-networks containing a high number of active or differentially regulated genes (proteins, metabolites) in the molecular profiles. The web interface at (http://keypathwayminer.compbio.sdu.dk) implements all core functionalities of the KeyPathwayMiner tool set such as data integration, input of background knowledge, batch runs for parameter optimization and visualization of extracted pathways. In addition to an intuitive web interface, we also implemented a RESTful API that now enables other online developers to integrate network enrichment as a web service into their own platforms.
36106996	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Multi-omic integration by machine learning (MIMaL).	MOTIVATION: Cells respond to environments by regulating gene expression to exploit resources optimally. Recent advances in technologies allow for measuring the abundances of RNA, proteins, lipids and metabolites. These highly complex datasets reflect the states of the different layers in a biological system. Multi-omics is the integration of these disparate methods and data to gain a clearer picture of the biological state. Multi-omic studies of the proteome and metabolome are becoming more common as mass spectrometry technology continues to be democratized. However, knowledge extraction through the integration of these data remains challenging. RESULTS: Connections between molecules in different omic layers were discovered through a combination of machine learning and model interpretation. Discovered connections reflected protein control (ProC) over metabolites. Proteins discovered to control citrate were mapped onto known genetic and metabolic networks, revealing that these protein regulators are novel. Further, clustering the magnitudes of ProC over all metabolites enabled the prediction of five gene functions, each of which was validated experimentally. Two uncharacterized genes, YJR120W and YDL157C, were accurately predicted to modulate mitochondrial translation. Functions for three incompletely characterized genes were also predicted and validated, including SDH9, ISC1 and FMP52. A website enables results exploration and also MIMaL analysis of user-supplied multi-omic data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The website for MIMaL is at https://mimal.app. Code for the website is at https://github.com/qdickinson/mimal-website. Code to implement MIMaL is at https://github.com/jessegmeyerlab/MIMaL. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
35191503	2022	Nucleic acids research	CellDART: cell type inference by domain adaptation of single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data.	Deciphering the cellular composition in genome-wide spatially resolved transcriptomic data is a critical task to clarify the spatial context of cells in a tissue. In this study, we developed a method, CellDART, which estimates the spatial distribution of cells defined by single-cell level data using domain adaptation of neural networks and applied it to the spatial mapping of human lung tissue. The neural network that predicts the cell proportion in a pseudospot, a virtual mixture of cells from single-cell data, is translated to decompose the cell types in each spatial barcoded region. First, CellDART was applied to a mouse brain and a human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissue to identify cell types with a layer-specific spatial distribution. Overall, the proposed approach showed more stable and higher accuracy with short execution time compared to other computational methods to predict the spatial location of excitatory neurons. CellDART was capable of decomposing cellular proportion in mouse hippocampus Slide-seq data. Furthermore, CellDART elucidated the cell type predominance defined by the human lung cell atlas across the lung tissue compartments and it corresponded to the known prevalent cell types. CellDART is expected to help to elucidate the spatial heterogeneity of cells and their close interactions in various tissues.
37956339	2024	Nucleic acids research	PigBiobank: a valuable resource for understanding genetic and biological mechanisms of diverse complex traits in pigs.	To fully unlock the potential of pigs as both agricultural species for animal-based protein food and biomedical models for human biology and disease, a comprehensive understanding of molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying various complex phenotypes in pigs and how the findings can be translated to other species, especially humans, are urgently needed. Here, within the Farm animal Genotype-Tissue Expression (FarmGTEx) project, we build the PigBiobank (http://pigbiobank.farmgtex.org) to systematically investigate the relationships among genomic variants, regulatory elements, genes, molecular networks, tissues and complex traits in pigs. This first version of the PigBiobank curates 71 885 pigs with both genotypes and phenotypes from over 100 pig breeds worldwide, covering 264 distinct complex traits. The PigBiobank has the following functions: (i) imputed sequence-based genotype-phenotype associations via a standardized and uniform pipeline, (ii) molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying trait-associations via integrating multi-omics data, (iii) cross-species gene mapping of complex traits via transcriptome-wide association studies, and (iv) high-quality results display and visualization. The PigBiobank will be updated timely with the development of the FarmGTEx-PigGTEx project, serving as an open-access and easy-to-use resource for genetically and biologically dissecting complex traits in pigs and translating the findings to other species.
34969984	2022	Nature methods	Lineage recording in human cerebral organoids.	Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived organoids provide models to study human organ development. Single-cell transcriptomics enable highly resolved descriptions of cell states within these systems; however, approaches are needed to directly measure lineage relationships. Here we establish iTracer, a lineage recorder that combines reporter barcodes with inducible CRISPR-Cas9 scarring and is compatible with single-cell and spatial transcriptomics. We apply iTracer to explore clonality and lineage dynamics during cerebral organoid development and identify a time window of fate restriction as well as variation in neurogenic dynamics between progenitor neuron families. We also establish long-term four-dimensional light-sheet microscopy for spatial lineage recording in cerebral organoids and confirm regional clonality in the developing neuroepithelium. We incorporate gene perturbation (iTracer-perturb) and assess the effect of mosaic TSC2 mutations on cerebral organoid development. Our data shed light on how lineages and fates are established during cerebral organoid formation. More broadly, our techniques can be adapted in any iPSC-derived culture system to dissect lineage alterations during normal or perturbed development.
41171131	2025	Nucleic acids research	CellSNVReg: a multidimensional resource for SNV-mediated regulatory perturbations in single-cell and spatial omics.	Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) represent the most prevalent form of genetic variation and can perturb gene regulation, RNA processing, and protein function across multiple molecular layers, ultimately altering cellular functional states and contributing to disease development. Here, we present CellSNVReg (http://bio-bigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/CellSNVReg/index.jsp), a comprehensive multidimensional resource systematically characterizing regulatory perturbations caused by SNVs at cell-type and spatial resolutions in humans. By integrating 4.6 million cellular profiles from scRNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, and scATAC-seq across normal, tumor, and other disease tissues, CellSNVReg identifies an average of over 70 000 regulatory perturbations per sample across six dimensions: miRNA-target, transcription factor (TF)-target, enhancer-target, RBP-target, protein-protein interaction, and neoantigen generation, and further characterizes differential expression of perturbed target genes together with associated perturbation networks. For each perturbation, CellSNVReg provides qualitative annotations and quantitative scores to assess SNV perturbation impact, potentially facilitating prioritization of candidate driver SNVs in disease-relevant contexts. To assess downstream functional consequences, the platform links SNV-perturbed targets to alterations in cell functions, states, stemness, metabolism, cell-cell communication, and drug repurposing. In summary, CellSNVReg offers a high-resolution framework for dissecting the functional impact of SNVs across diverse regulatory layers, enabling exploration of the landscape of SNV-mediated regulatory disruptions and their phenotypic consequences in normal and disease contexts.
34341583	2021	Nature methods	Spatial omics and multiplexed imaging to explore cancer biology.	Understanding intratumoral heterogeneity-the molecular variation among cells within a tumor-promises to address outstanding questions in cancer biology and improve the diagnosis and treatment of specific cancer subtypes. Single-cell analyses, especially RNA sequencing and other genomics modalities, have been transformative in revealing novel biomarkers and molecular regulators associated with tumor growth, metastasis and drug resistance. However, these approaches fail to provide a complete picture of tumor biology, as information on cellular location within the tumor microenvironment is lost. New technologies leveraging multiplexed fluorescence, DNA, RNA and isotope labeling enable the detection of tens to thousands of cancer subclones or molecular biomarkers within their native spatial context. The expeditious growth in these techniques, along with methods for multiomics data integration, promises to yield a more comprehensive understanding of cell-to-cell variation within and between individual tumors. Here we provide the current state and future perspectives on the spatial technologies expected to drive the next generation of research and diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for cancer.
34599004	2021	Genome research	Advances in spatial transcriptomic data analysis.	Spatial transcriptomics is a rapidly growing field that promises to comprehensively characterize tissue organization and architecture at the single-cell or subcellular resolution. Such information provides a solid foundation for mechanistic understanding of many biological processes in both health and disease that cannot be obtained by using traditional technologies. The development of computational methods plays important roles in extracting biological signals from raw data. Various approaches have been developed to overcome technology-specific limitations such as spatial resolution, gene coverage, sensitivity, and technical biases. Downstream analysis tools formulate spatial organization and cell-cell communications as quantifiable properties, and provide algorithms to derive such properties. Integrative pipelines further assemble multiple tools in one package, allowing biologists to conveniently analyze data from beginning to end. In this review, we summarize the state of the art of spatial transcriptomic data analysis methods and pipelines, and discuss how they operate on different technological platforms.
35977841	2022	Genome research	dbEmbryo multi-omics database for analyses of synergistic regulation in early mammalian embryo development.	"During early mammalian embryo development, different epigenetic marks undergo reprogramming and play crucial roles in the mediation of gene expression. Currently, several databases provide multi-omics information on early embryos. However, how interconnected epigenetic markers function together to coordinate the expression of the genetic code in a spatiotemporal manner remains difficult to analyze, markedly limiting scientific and clinical research. Here, we present dbEmbryo, an integrated and interactive multi-omics database for human and mouse early embryos. dbEmbryo integrates data on gene expression, DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin accessibility, and higher-order chromatin structure profiles for human and mouse early embryos. It incorporates customized analysis tools, such as ""multi-omics visualization,"" ""Gene&Peak annotation,"" ""ZGA gene cluster,"" ""cis-regulation,"" ""synergistic regulation,"" ""promoter signal enrichment,"" and ""3D genome.""

34488839	2021	Genome biology	Genomic basis underlying the metabolome-mediated drought adaptation of maize.	BACKGROUND: Drought is a major environmental disaster that causes crop yield loss worldwide. Metabolites are involved in various environmental stress responses of plants. However, the genetic control of metabolomes underlying crop environmental stress adaptation remains elusive. RESULTS: Here, we perform non-targeted metabolic profiling of leaves for 385 maize natural inbred lines grown under well-watered as well as drought-stressed conditions. A total of 3890 metabolites are identified and 1035 of these are differentially produced between well-watered and drought-stressed conditions, representing effective indicators of maize drought response and tolerance. Genetic dissections reveal the associations between these metabolites and thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which represented 3415 metabolite quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) and 2589 candidate genes. 78.6% of mQTLs (2684/3415) are novel drought-responsive QTLs. The regulatory variants that control the expression of the candidate genes are revealed by expression QTL (eQTL) analysis of the transcriptomes of leaves from 197 maize natural inbred lines. Integrated metabolic and transcriptomic assays identify dozens of environment-specific hub genes and their gene-metabolite regulatory networks. Comprehensive genetic and molecular studies reveal the roles and mechanisms of two hub genes, Bx12 and ZmGLK44, in regulating maize metabolite biosynthesis and drought tolerance. CONCLUSION: Our studies reveal the first population-level metabolomes in crop drought response and uncover the natural variations and genetic control of these metabolomes underlying crop drought adaptation, demonstrating that multi-omics is a powerful strategy to dissect the genetic mechanisms of crop complex traits.
26377073	2016	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	A non-negative matrix factorization method for detecting modules in heterogeneous omics multi-modal data.	MOTIVATION: Recent advances in high-throughput omics technologies have enabled biomedical researchers to collect large-scale genomic data. As a consequence, there has been growing interest in developing methods to integrate such data to obtain deeper insights regarding the underlying biological system. A key challenge for integrative studies is the heterogeneity present in the different omics data sources, which makes it difficult to discern the coordinated signal of interest from source-specific noise or extraneous effects. RESULTS: We introduce a novel method of multi-modal data analysis that is designed for heterogeneous data based on non-negative matrix factorization. We provide an algorithm for jointly decomposing the data matrices involved that also includes a sparsity option for high-dimensional settings. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on synthetic data and on real DNA methylation, gene expression and miRNA expression data from ovarian cancer samples obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The results show the presence of common modules across patient samples linked to cancer-related pathways, as well as previously established ovarian cancer subtypes. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code repository is publicly available at https://github.com/yangzi4/iNMF.

39103939	2024	Genome biology	STdGCN: spatial transcriptomic cell-type deconvolution using graph convolutional networks.	Spatially resolved transcriptomics integrates high-throughput transcriptome measurements with preserved spatial cellular organization information. However, many technologies cannot reach single-cell resolution. We present STdGCN, a graph model leveraging single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) as reference for cell-type deconvolution in spatial transcriptomic (ST) data. STdGCN incorporates expression profiles from scRNA-seq and spatial localization from ST data for deconvolution. Extensive benchmarking on multiple datasets demonstrates that STdGCN outperforms 17 state-of-the-art models. In a human breast cancer Visium dataset, STdGCN delineates stroma, lymphocytes, and cancer cells, aiding tumor microenvironment analysis. In human heart ST data, STdGCN identifies changes in endothelial-cardiomyocyte communications during tissue development.
40802546	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	HallmarkGraph: a cancer hallmark informed graph neural network for classifying hierarchical tumor subtypes.	MOTIVATION: Accurate tumor subtype diagnosis is crucial for precision oncology, yet current methodologies face significant challenges. These include balancing model accuracy with interpretability and the high costs of generating multi-omics data in clinical settings. Moreover, there is a lack of validated models capable of classifying hierarchical tumor subtypes across a comprehensive pan-cancer cohort. RESULTS: We present a graph neural network, HallmarkGraph, the first biologically informed model developed to classify hierarchical tumor subtypes in human cancer. Inspired by cancer hallmarks, the model's architecture integrates transcriptome profiles and gene regulatory interactions to perform multi-label classification. We evaluate the model on a comprehensive pan-cancer cohort comprising 11 476 samples from 26 primary cancers with 405 subtypes up to eight levels. The model demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving 5-fold cross-validation accuracy between 85% and 99% for tumor subtypes labeled with increasing details of genomic information. It also shows good generalizability on a validation dataset of 887 samples, assessed using three metrics that consider tumor subtypes at individual, combined, and sample levels. Benchmarking and ablation experiments show that hallmark-based embeddings slightly influence model performance, while the integrated multilayer perceptron plays a significant role in determining classifier accuracy. Additionally, we use the SHAP method to link cancer hallmarks with genes, identifying key features that influence model decisions. Our findings present a biologically informed machine learning framework capable of tracking tumor transcriptomic trajectories and distinguishing inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity in pan-cancer. This approach holds promise for enhancing cancer diagnostics. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: HallmarkGraph is accessible at https://github.com/laixn/HallmarkGraph.
41160874	2025	Nucleic acids research	KnockRBP: an integrated multi-omics database of functional perturbation profiles for RNA-binding proteins.	RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) regulate diverse post-transcriptional processes, yet their functional impacts across multiple molecular layers remain incompletely characterized. KnockRBP (https://knockrbp.xu-bioinfo.com) is presented as a comprehensive, multi-omics database systematically cataloging regulatory changes resulting from genetic perturbation of RBPs. The resource integrates 1453 datasets from GEO, ENA, and ENCORE, encompassing RNA-seq, Ribo-seq, microRNA (miRNA)-seq, and 3'RACE-seq across 639 RBPs, 182 cell lines, and 61 diseases. Regulatory outcomes covered include alternative splicing, alternative polyadenylation, RNA editing, transcript abundance, translation efficiency, and miRNA expression, with all events processed through standardized analytical pipelines and annotated with open reading frame consequences, predicted loss-of-function impacts, and established disease or drug associations. The web interface supports dataset browsing, RBP- and gene-centric multi-omics exploration, transcript structure visualization, and interactive regulatory network navigation, while integrated analytical modules enable prioritization of perturbation-responsive events, cross-layer regulatory inference, and evaluation of clinical relevance. In contrast to existing RBP resources, KnockRBP integrates multi-omics data with perturbation-aware functional annotation, enabling mechanistic investigation and identification of RBP-affected genes and events in post-transcriptional regulation. The database is freely accessible and intended for long-term maintenance, serving as a community resource to advance functional genomics research on RBPs and their roles in human disease.
33148332	2020	Genome biology	Multiomics profiling of primary lung cancers and distant metastases reveals immunosuppression as a common characteristic of tumor cells with metastatic plasticity.	BACKGROUND: Metastasis is the primary cause of cancer mortality accounting for 90% of cancer deaths. Our understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving metastasis is rudimentary. RESULTS: We perform whole exome sequencing (WES), RNA sequencing, methylation microarray, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) on 8 pairs of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) primary tumors and matched distant metastases. Furthermore, we analyze published WES data from 35 primary NSCLC and metastasis pairs, and transcriptomic data from 4 autopsy cases with metastatic NSCLC and one metastatic lung cancer mouse model. The majority of somatic mutations are shared between primary tumors and paired distant metastases although mutational signatures suggest different mutagenesis processes in play before and after metastatic spread. Subclonal analysis reveals evidence of monoclonal seeding in 41 of 42 patients. Pathway analysis of transcriptomic data reveals that downregulated pathways in metastases are mainly immune-related. Further deconvolution analysis reveals significantly lower infiltration of various immune cell types in metastases with the exception of CD4+ T cells and M2 macrophages. These results are in line with lower densities of immune cells and higher CD4/CD8 ratios in metastases shown by IHC. Analysis of transcriptomic data from autopsy cases and animal models confirms that immunosuppression is also present in extracranial metastases. Significantly higher somatic copy number aberration and allelic imbalance burdens are identified in metastases. CONCLUSIONS: Metastasis is a molecularly late event, and immunosuppression driven by different molecular events, including somatic copy number aberration, may be a common characteristic of tumors with metastatic plasticity.
38975895	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Accurately deciphering spatial domains for spatially resolved transcriptomics with stCluster.	Spatial transcriptomics provides valuable insights into gene expression within the native tissue context, effectively merging molecular data with spatial information to uncover intricate cellular relationships and tissue organizations. In this context, deciphering cellular spatial domains becomes essential for revealing complex cellular dynamics and tissue structures. However, current methods encounter challenges in seamlessly integrating gene expression data with spatial information, resulting in less informative representations of spots and suboptimal accuracy in spatial domain identification. We introduce stCluster, a novel method that integrates graph contrastive learning with multi-task learning to refine informative representations for spatial transcriptomic data, consequently improving spatial domain identification. stCluster first leverages graph contrastive learning technology to obtain discriminative representations capable of recognizing spatially coherent patterns. Through jointly optimizing multiple tasks, stCluster further fine-tunes the representations to be able to capture complex relationships between gene expression and spatial organization. Benchmarked against six state-of-the-art methods, the experimental results reveal its proficiency in accurately identifying complex spatial domains across various datasets and platforms, spanning tissue, organ, and embryo levels. Moreover, stCluster can effectively denoise the spatial gene expression patterns and enhance the spatial trajectory inference. The source code of stCluster is freely available at https://github.com/hannshu/stCluster.
40156041	2025	Genome biology	Benchmarking spatial transcriptomics technologies with the multi-sample SpatialBenchVisium dataset.	BACKGROUND: Spatial transcriptomics allows gene expression to be measured within complex tissue contexts. Among the array of spatial capture technologies available is 10x Genomics' Visium platform, a popular method which enables transcriptome-wide profiling of tissue sections. Visium offers a range of sample handling and library construction methods which introduces a need for benchmarking to compare data quality and assess how well the technology can recover expected tissue features and biological signatures. RESULTS: Here we present SpatialBenchVisium, a unique reference dataset generated from spleen tissue of mice responding to malaria infection spanning several tissue preparation protocols (both fresh frozen and FFPE, with either manual or CytAssist tissue placement). We note better quality control metrics in reference samples prepared using probe-based capture methods, particularly those processed with CytAssist, validating the improvement in data quality produced with the platform. Our analysis of replicate samples extends to explore spatially variable gene detection, the outcomes of clustering and cell deconvolution using matched single-cell RNA-sequencing data and publicly available reference data to identify cell types and tissue regions expected in the spleen. Multi-sample differential expression analysis recovered known gene signatures related to biological sex or gene knockout.
40481363	2025	Nature methods	CellNEST reveals cell-cell relay networks using attention mechanisms on spatial transcriptomics.	Dysregulation of communication between cells mediates complex diseases such as cancer and diabetes; however, detecting cell-cell communication at scale remains one of the greatest challenges in transcriptomics. Most current single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics computational approaches exhibit high false-positive rates, do not detect signals between individual cells and only identify single ligand-receptor communication. To overcome these challenges, we developed Cell Neural Networks on Spatial Transcriptomics (CellNEST) to decipher patterns of communication. Our model introduces a new type of relay-network communication detection that identifies putative ligand-receptor-ligand-receptor communication. CellNEST detects T cell homing signals in human lymph nodes, identifies aggressive cancer communication in lung adenocarcinoma and colorectal cancer, and predicts new patterns of communication that may act as relay networks in pancreatic cancer. Along with CellNEST, we provide a web-based, interactive visualization method to explore in situ communication. CellNEST is available at https://github.com/schwartzlab-methods/CellNEST .
41168487	2025	Nature methods	Nicheformer: a foundation model for single-cell and spatial omics.	Tissue makeup depends on the local cellular microenvironment. Spatial single-cell genomics enables scalable and unbiased interrogation of these interactions. Here we introduce Nicheformer, a transformer-based foundation model trained on both human and mouse dissociated single-cell and targeted spatial transcriptomics data. Pretrained on SpatialCorpus-110M, a curated collection of over 57 million dissociated and 53 million spatially resolved cells across 73 tissues on cellular reconstruction, Nicheformer learns cell representations that capture spatial context. It excels in linear-probing and fine-tuning scenarios for a newly designed set of downstream tasks, in particular spatial composition prediction and spatial label prediction. Critically, we show that models trained only on dissociated data fail to recover the complexity of spatial microenvironments, underscoring the need for multiscale integration. Nicheformer enables the prediction of the spatial context of dissociated cells, allowing the transfer of rich spatial information to scRNA-seq datasets. Overall, Nicheformer sets the stage for the next generation of machine-learning models in spatial single-cell analysis.
39101486	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Transcriptomics and epigenetic data integration learning module on Google Cloud.	Multi-omics (genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, metabolomics, etc.) research approaches are vital for understanding the hierarchical complexity of human biology and have proven to be extremely valuable in cancer research and precision medicine. Emerging scientific advances in recent years have made high-throughput genome-wide sequencing a central focus in molecular research by allowing for the collective analysis of various kinds of molecular biological data from different types of specimens in a single tissue or even at the level of a single cell. Additionally, with the help of improved computational resources and data mining, researchers are able to integrate data from different multi-omics regimes to identify new prognostic, diagnostic, or predictive biomarkers, uncover novel therapeutic targets, and develop more personalized treatment protocols for patients. For the research community to parse the scientifically and clinically meaningful information out of all the biological data being generated each day more efficiently with less wasted resources, being familiar with and comfortable using advanced analytical tools, such as Google Cloud Platform becomes imperative. This project is an interdisciplinary, cross-organizational effort to provide a guided learning module for integrating transcriptomics and epigenetics data analysis protocols into a comprehensive analysis pipeline for users to implement in their own work, utilizing the cloud computing infrastructure on Google Cloud. The learning module consists of three submodules that guide the user through tutorial examples that illustrate the analysis of RNA-sequence and Reduced-Representation Bisulfite Sequencing data. The examples are in the form of breast cancer case studies, and the data sets were procured from the public repository Gene Expression Omnibus. The first submodule is devoted to transcriptomics analysis with the RNA sequencing data, the second submodule focuses on epigenetics analysis using the DNA methylation data, and the third submodule integrates the two methods for a deeper biological understanding. The modules begin with data collection and preprocessing, with further downstream analysis performed in a Vertex AI Jupyter notebook instance with an R kernel. Analysis results are returned to Google Cloud buckets for storage and visualization, removing the computational strain from local resources. The final product is a start-to-finish tutorial for the researchers with limited experience in multi-omics to integrate transcriptomics and epigenetics data analysis into a comprehensive pipeline to perform their own biological research.This manuscript describes the development of a resource module that is part of a learning platform named ;;NIGMS Sandbox for Cloud-based Learning'' https://github.com/NIGMS/NIGMS-Sandbox. The overall genesis of the Sandbox is described in the editorial NIGMS Sandbox [16] at the beginning of this Supplement. This module delivers learning materials on the analysis of bulk and single-cell ATAC-seq data in an interactive format that uses appropriate cloud resources for data access and analyses.
37231260	2024	Nature biotechnology	Stabilized mosaic single-cell data integration using unshared features.	Currently available single-cell omics technologies capture many unique features with different biological information content. Data integration aims to place cells, captured with different technologies, onto a common embedding to facilitate downstream analytical tasks. Current horizontal data integration techniques use a set of common features, thereby ignoring non-overlapping features and losing information. Here we introduce StabMap, a mosaic data integration technique that stabilizes mapping of single-cell data by exploiting the non-overlapping features. StabMap first infers a mosaic data topology based on shared features, then projects all cells onto supervised or unsupervised reference coordinates by traversing shortest paths along the topology. We show that StabMap performs well in various simulation contexts, facilitates 'multi-hop' mosaic data integration where some datasets do not share any features and enables the use of spatial gene expression features for mapping dissociated single-cell data onto a spatial transcriptomic reference.
28398467	2017	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	ST Pipeline: an automated pipeline for spatial mapping of unique transcripts.	MOTIVATION: In recent years we have witnessed an increase in novel RNA-seq based techniques for transcriptomics analysis. Spatial transcriptomics is a novel RNA-seq based technique that allows spatial mapping of transcripts in tissue sections. The spatial resolution adds an extra level of complexity, which requires the development of new tools and algorithms for efficient and accurate data processing. RESULTS: Here we present a pipeline to automatically and efficiently process RNA-seq data obtained from spatial transcriptomics experiments to generate datasets for downstream analysis.

38118002	2024	Nucleic acids research	Histone lactylation-boosted ALKBH3 potentiates tumor progression and diminished promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear condensates by m1A demethylation of SP100A.	Albeit N1-Methyladenosine (m1A) RNA modification represents an important regulator of RNA metabolism, the role of m1A modification in carcinogenesis remains enigmatic. Herein, we found that histone lactylation enhances ALKBH3 expression and simultaneously attenuates the formation of tumor-suppressive promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) condensates by removing the m1A methylation of SP100A, promoting the malignant transformation of cancers. First, ALKBH3 is specifically upregulated in high-risk ocular melanoma due to excessive histone lactylation levels, referring to m1A hypomethylation status. Moreover, the multiomics analysis subsequently identified that SP100A, a core component for PML bodies, serves as a downstream candidate target for ALKBH3. Therapeutically, the silencing of ALKBH3 exhibits efficient therapeutic efficacy in melanoma both in vitro and in vivo, which could be reversed by the depletion of SP100A. Mechanistically, we found that YTHDF1 is responsible for recognition of the m1A methylated SP100A transcript, which increases its RNA stability and translational efficacy. Conclusively, we initially demonstrated that m1A modification is necessary for tumor suppressor gene expression, expanding the current understandings of dynamic m1A function during tumor progression. In addition, our results indicate that lactylation-driven ALKBH3 is essential for the formation of PML nuclear condensates, which bridges our knowledge of m1A modification, metabolic reprogramming, and phase-separation events.
31510700	2019	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	MOLI: multi-omics late integration with deep neural networks for drug response prediction.	MOTIVATION: Historically, gene expression has been shown to be the most informative data for drug response prediction. Recent evidence suggests that integrating additional omics can improve the prediction accuracy which raises the question of how to integrate the additional omics. Regardless of the integration strategy, clinical utility and translatability are crucial. Thus, we reasoned a multi-omics approach combined with clinical datasets would improve drug response prediction and clinical relevance. RESULTS: We propose MOLI, a multi-omics late integration method based on deep neural networks. MOLI takes somatic mutation, copy number aberration and gene expression data as input, and integrates them for drug response prediction. MOLI uses type-specific encoding sub-networks to learn features for each omics type, concatenates them into one representation and optimizes this representation via a combined cost function consisting of a triplet loss and a binary cross-entropy loss. The former makes the representations of responder samples more similar to each other and different from the non-responders, and the latter makes this representation predictive of the response values. We validate MOLI on in vitro and in vivo datasets for five chemotherapy agents and two targeted therapeutics. Compared to state-of-the-art single-omics and early integration multi-omics methods, MOLI achieves higher prediction accuracy in external validations. Moreover, a significant improvement in MOLI's performance is observed for targeted drugs when training on a pan-drug input, i.e. using all the drugs with the same target compared to training only on drug-specific inputs. MOLI's high predictive power suggests it may have utility in precision oncology. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: https://github.com/hosseinshn/MOLI. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
39120644	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	xSiGra: explainable model for single-cell spatial data elucidation.	Recent advancements in spatial imaging technologies have revolutionized the acquisition of high-resolution multichannel images, gene expressions, and spatial locations at the single-cell level. Our study introduces xSiGra, an interpretable graph-based AI model, designed to elucidate interpretable features of identified spatial cell types, by harnessing multimodal features from spatial imaging technologies. By constructing a spatial cellular graph with immunohistology images and gene expression as node attributes, xSiGra employs hybrid graph transformer models to delineate spatial cell types. Additionally, xSiGra integrates a novel variant of gradient-weighted class activation mapping component to uncover interpretable features, including pivotal genes and cells for various cell types, thereby facilitating deeper biological insights from spatial data. Through rigorous benchmarking against existing methods, xSiGra demonstrates superior performance across diverse spatial imaging datasets. Application of xSiGra on a lung tumor slice unveils the importance score of cells, illustrating that cellular activity is not solely determined by itself but also impacted by neighboring cells. Moreover, leveraging the identified interpretable genes, xSiGra reveals endothelial cell subset interacting with tumor cells, indicating its heterogeneous underlying mechanisms within complex cellular interactions.
31483777	2019	PLoS computational biology	Integrating thermodynamic and sequence contexts improves protein-RNA binding prediction.	Predicting RNA-binding protein (RBP) specificity is important for understanding gene expression regulation and RNA-mediated enzymatic processes. It is widely believed that RBP binding specificity is determined by both the sequence and structural contexts of RNAs. Existing approaches, including traditional machine learning algorithms and more recently, deep learning models, have been extensively applied to integrate RNA sequence and its predicted or experimental RNA structural probabilities for improving the accuracy of RBP binding prediction. Such models were trained mostly on the large-scale in vitro datasets, such as the RNAcompete dataset. However, in RNAcompete, most synthetic RNAs are unstructured, which makes machine learning methods not effectively extract RBP-binding structural preferences. Furthermore, RNA structure may be variable or multi-modal according to both theoretical and experimental evidence. In this work, we propose ThermoNet, a thermodynamic prediction model by integrating a new sequence-embedding convolutional neural network model over a thermodynamic ensemble of RNA secondary structures. First, the sequence-embedding convolutional neural network generalizes the existing k-mer based methods by jointly learning convolutional filters and k-mer embeddings to represent RNA sequence contexts. Second, the thermodynamic average of deep-learning predictions is able to explore structural variability and improves the prediction, especially for the structured RNAs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, including RCK, DeepBind and several other recent state-of-the-art methods for predictions on both in vitro and in vivo data. The implementation of ThermoNet is available at https://github.com/suyufeng/ThermoNet.
34354295	2021	Nature methods	SCITO-seq: single-cell combinatorial indexed cytometry sequencing.	The development of DNA-barcoded antibodies to tag cell surface molecules has enabled the use of droplet-based single-cell sequencing (dsc-seq) to profile protein abundances from thousands of cells simultaneously. As compared to flow and mass cytometry, the high per cell cost of current dsc-seq-based workflows precludes their use in clinical applications and large-scale pooled screens. Here, we introduce SCITO-seq, a workflow that uses splint oligonucleotides (oligos) to enable combinatorially indexed dsc-seq of DNA-barcoded antibodies from over 10(5) cells per reaction using commercial microfluidics. By encoding sample barcodes into splint oligos, we demonstrate that multiplexed SCITO-seq produces reproducible estimates of cellular composition and surface protein expression comparable to those from mass cytometry. We further demonstrate two modified splint oligo designs that extend SCITO-seq to achieve compatibility with commercial DNA-barcoded antibodies and simultaneous expression profiling of the transcriptome and surface proteins from the same cell. These results demonstrate SCITO-seq as a flexible and ultra-high-throughput platform for sequencing-based single-cell protein and multimodal profiling.
40445003	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Multi-omics analysis of Helicobacter pylori-associated gastric cancer identifies hub genes as a novel therapeutic biomarker.	Helicobacter pylori infection is one of the most common gastric pathogens; however, the molecular mechanisms driving its progression to gastric cancer remain poorly understood. This study aimed to identify the key transcriptomic drivers and therapeutic targets of H. pylori-associated gastric cancer through an integrative transcriptomic analysis. This analysis integrates microarray and RNA-seq datasets to identify significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in the progression of H. pylori-associated gastric cancer. In addition to independent analyses, data were integrated using ComBat to detect consistent expression patterns of hub genes. This approach revealed distinct clustering patterns and stage-specific transcriptional changes in common DEGs across disease progression, including H. pylori infection, gastritis, atrophy, and gastric cancer. Genes such as TPX2, MKI67, EXO1, and CTHRC1 exhibited progressive upregulation from infection to cancer, highlighting involvement in cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and extracellular matrix remodeling. These findings provide insights into molecular shifts linking inflammation-driven infection to malignancy. Furthermore, network analysis identified hub genes, including CXCL1, CCL20, IL12B, and STAT4, which are enriched in immune pathways such as chemotaxis, leukocyte migration, and cytokine signaling. This emphasizes their role in immune dysregulation and tumor development. Expression profiling demonstrated the upregulation of hub genes in gastric cancer and stage-specific changes correlating with disease progression. Finally, drug-gene interaction analysis identified therapeutic opportunities, with hub genes interacting with approved drugs like abatacept and zoledronic acid, as well as developmental drugs such as adjuvant and relapladib. These findings highlight the key role of these hub genes as biomarkers and therapeutic targets, providing a foundation for advancing precision medicine in H. pylori-associated gastric cancer. Overall, this study paves the way for advancing precision medicine in H. pylori-associated gastric cancer by providing insights into the development of early detection biomarkers, risk stratification, and targeted therapies. This supports the clinical translation of precision medicine strategies in H. pylori-associated gastric cancer.

34718395	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	A comprehensive review of the analysis and integration of omics data for SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.	Since the first report of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019, over 100 million people have been infected by COVID-19, millions of whom have died. In the latest year, a large number of omics data have sprung up and helped researchers broadly study the sequence, chemical structure and function of SARS-CoV-2, as well as molecular abnormal mechanisms of COVID-19 patients. Though some successes have been achieved in these areas, it is necessary to analyze and mine omics data for comprehensively understanding SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. Hence, we reviewed the current advantages and limitations of the integration of omics data herein. Firstly, we sorted out the sequence resources and database resources of SARS-CoV-2, including protein chemical structure, potential drug information and research literature resources. Next, we collected omics data of the COVID-19 hosts, including genomics, transcriptomics, microbiology and potential drug information data. And subsequently, based on the integration of omics data, we summarized the existing data analysis methods and the related research results of COVID-19 multi-omics data in recent years. Finally, we put forward SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) multi-omics data integration research direction and gave a case study to mine deeper for the disease mechanisms of COVID-19.
41310055	2025	Nature methods	FX-Cell: a method for single-cell RNA sequencing on difficult-to-digest and cryopreserved plant samples.	Single-cell RNA sequencing in plants requires the isolation of high-quality protoplasts-cells devoid of cell walls. However, many plant tissues and organs are resistant to enzymatic digestion, posing a significant barrier to advancing single-cell multi-omics in plant research. Furthermore, for field-grown crops, the lack of immediate laboratory facilities presents another major challenge for timely protoplast preparation. Here, to address these limitations, we developed FX-Cell and its derivatives, FXcryo-Cell and cryoFX-Cell, to enable single-cell RNA sequencing with both difficult-to-digest and cryopreserved plant samples. By optimizing the fixation buffer and minimizing RNA degradation, our approach ensures efficient cell wall digestion at high temperatures while maintaining high-quality single cells, even after long-term storage at -80  degrees C, and circumvents use of nuclei, which are not representative of the pool of translatable messenger RNAs. We successfully constructed high-quality cell atlases for rice tiller nodes, rhizomes of wild rice and maize crown roots grown under field conditions. Moreover, these methods enable the accurate reconstruction of plant acute wounding responses at single-cell resolution. Collectively, these advancements expand the applicability of plant single-cell genomics across a wider range of species and tissues, paving the way for comprehensive Plant Cell Atlases for plant species.
34930412	2021	Genome biology	MultiMAP: dimensionality reduction and integration of multimodal data.	Multimodal data is rapidly growing in many fields of science and engineering, including single-cell biology. We introduce MultiMAP, a novel algorithm for dimensionality reduction and integration. MultiMAP can integrate any number of datasets, leverages features not present in all datasets, is not restricted to a linear mapping, allows the user to specify the influence of each dataset, and is extremely scalable to large datasets. We apply MultiMAP to single-cell transcriptomics, chromatin accessibility, methylation, and spatial data and show that it outperforms current approaches. On a new thymus dataset, we use MultiMAP to integrate cells along a temporal trajectory. This enables quantitative comparison of transcription factor expression and binding site accessibility over the course of T cell differentiation, revealing patterns of expression versus binding site opening kinetics.
40814229	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	DriverOmicsNet: an integrated graph convolutional network for multi-omics exploration of cancer driver genes.	Cancer is a complex and heterogeneous group of diseases driven by genetic mutations and molecular changes. Identifying and characterizing cancer driver gene is crucial for understanding cancer biology and guiding precision oncology. Integrating multi-omics data can reveal the intricate molecular interactions underlying cancer progression and treatment responses. We developed a graph convolutional network (GCN) framework, DriverOmicsNet, that integrates multi-omics data using STRING protein-protein interaction networks and correlation-based weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA). We applied this framework to 15 cancer types, analyzing 5555 tumor samples to predict cancer-related features such as homologous recombination deficiency, cancer stemness, immune clusters, tumor stage, and survival outcomes. DriverOmicsNet demonstrated superior predictive accuracy and model performance metrics across all target labels when compared with GCN models based on STRING network alone. Gene expression emerged as the most significant feature, reflecting the dynamic and functional state of cancer cells. The combined use of STRING PPI and WGCNA networks enhanced the identification of key driver genes and their interactions. Our study highlights the effectiveness of using GCNs to integrate multi-omics data for precision oncology. The integration of STRING PPI and WGCNA networks provides a comprehensive framework that improves predictive power and facilitates the understanding of cancer biology, paving the way for more tailored treatments.
41263940	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	SciSt: single-cell reference-informed spatial gene expression prediction from pathological images.	The widespread application of spatial transcriptomics in uncovering disease mechanisms remains limited by the scarcity of samples and the high experimental costs, which have not declined substantially in recent years. Unlocking the vast resources of clinical H&E-stained images could provide an efficient and cost-effective alternative for large-scale spatial analysis. However, predicting spatial gene expression from histopathological images remains challenging, as existing end-to-end frameworks often fail to capture the intrinsic transcriptomic structures observed in real transcriptomics data. To address this, we developed SciSt, a deep learning framework that predicts spatial gene expression by integrating pathological features with biologically informed initial gene expressions. These initial expressions are generated through a weighted strategy combining cell segmentation and single-cell reference data, thereby enhancing biological interpretability. SciSt achieved state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets, outperforming the second-best models by 21.4% and 13.7%, respectively, and demonstrated robust generalization on the TCGA-BRCA and TCGA-LIHC cohorts. Beyond accurate prediction, SciSt enables cross-modal translation between morphology and gene expression, offering new avenues for mining the untapped potential of clinical image archives.

BACKGROUND: Recent advances in imaging-based spatially resolved transcriptomics (im-SRT) technologies now enable high-throughput profiling of targeted genes and their locations in fixed tissues. Normalization of gene expression data is often needed to account for technical factors that may confound underlying biological signals. RESULTS: Here, we investigate the potential impact of different gene count normalization methods with different targeted gene panels in the analysis and interpretation of im-SRT data. Using different simulated gene panels that overrepresent genes expressed in specific tissue regions or cell types, we demonstrate how normalization methods based on detected gene counts per cell differentially impact normalized gene expression magnitudes in a region- or cell type-specific manner. We show that these normalization-induced effects may reduce the reliability of downstream analyses including differential gene expression, gene fold change, and spatially variable gene analysis, introducing false positive and false negative results when compared to results obtained from gene panels that are more representative of the gene expression of the tissue's component cell types. These effects are not observed with normalization approaches that do not use detected gene counts for gene expression magnitude adjustment, such as with cell volume or cell area normalization. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend using non-gene count-based normalization approaches when feasible and evaluating gene panel representativeness before using gene count-based normalization methods if necessary. Overall, we caution that the choice of normalization method and gene panel may impact the biological interpretation of the im-SRT data.
33288904	2021	Nature biotechnology	Highly sensitive spatial transcriptomics at near-cellular resolution with Slide-seqV2.	Measurement of the location of molecules in tissues is essential for understanding tissue formation and function. Previously, we developed Slide-seq, a technology that enables transcriptome-wide detection of RNAs with a spatial resolution of 10 mum. Here we report Slide-seqV2, which combines improvements in library generation, bead synthesis and array indexing to reach an RNA capture efficiency ~50% that of single-cell RNA-seq data (~10-fold greater than Slide-seq), approaching the detection efficiency of droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq techniques. First, we leverage the detection efficiency of Slide-seqV2 to identify dendritically localized mRNAs in neurons of the mouse hippocampus. Second, we integrate the spatial information of Slide-seqV2 data with single-cell trajectory analysis tools to characterize the spatiotemporal development of the mouse neocortex, identifying underlying genetic programs that were poorly sampled with Slide-seq. The combination of near-cellular resolution and high transcript detection efficiency makes Slide-seqV2 useful across many experimental contexts.
35449415	2022	Nature biotechnology	DestVI identifies continuums of cell types in spatial transcriptomics data.	Most spatial transcriptomics technologies are limited by their resolution, with spot sizes larger than that of a single cell. Although joint analysis with single-cell RNA sequencing can alleviate this problem, current methods are limited to assessing discrete cell types, revealing the proportion of cell types inside each spot. To identify continuous variation of the transcriptome within cells of the same type, we developed Deconvolution of Spatial Transcriptomics profiles using Variational Inference (DestVI). Using simulations, we demonstrate that DestVI outperforms existing methods for estimating gene expression for every cell type inside every spot. Applied to a study of infected lymph nodes and of a mouse tumor model, DestVI provides high-resolution, accurate spatial characterization of the cellular organization of these tissues and identifies cell-type-specific changes in gene expression between different tissue regions or between conditions. DestVI is available as part of the open-source software package scvi-tools ( https://scvi-tools.org ).
38627939	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Attention-guided variational graph autoencoders reveal heterogeneity in spatial transcriptomics.	The latest breakthroughs in spatially resolved transcriptomics technology offer comprehensive opportunities to delve into gene expression patterns within the tissue microenvironment. However, the precise identification of spatial domains within tissues remains challenging. In this study, we introduce AttentionVGAE (AVGN), which integrates slice images, spatial information and raw gene expression while calibrating low-quality gene expression. By combining the variational graph autoencoder with multi-head attention blocks (MHA blocks), AVGN captures spatial relationships in tissue gene expression, adaptively focusing on key features and alleviating the need for prior knowledge of cluster numbers, thereby achieving superior clustering performance. Particularly, AVGN attempts to balance the model's attention focus on local and global structures by utilizing MHA blocks, an aspect that current graph neural networks have not extensively addressed. Benchmark testing demonstrates its significant efficacy in elucidating tissue anatomy and interpreting tumor heterogeneity, indicating its potential in advancing spatial transcriptomics research and understanding complex biological phenomena.
38844629	2024	Nature methods	Deconwolf enables high-performance deconvolution of widefield fluorescence microscopy images.	Microscopy-based spatially resolved omic methods are transforming the life sciences. However, these methods rely on high numerical aperture objectives and cannot resolve crowded molecular targets, limiting the amount of extractable biological information. To overcome these limitations, here we develop Deconwolf, an open-source, user-friendly software for high-performance deconvolution of widefield fluorescence microscopy images, which efficiently runs on laptop computers. Deconwolf enables accurate quantification of crowded diffraction limited fluorescence dots in DNA and RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization images and allows robust detection of individual transcripts in tissue sections imaged with x20 air objectives. Deconvolution of in situ spatial transcriptomics images with Deconwolf increased the number of transcripts identified more than threefold, while the application of Deconwolf to images obtained by fluorescence in situ sequencing of barcoded Oligopaint probes drastically improved chromosome tracing. Deconwolf greatly facilitates the use of deconvolution in many bioimaging applications.
38273415	2024	Genome biology	Gene panel selection for targeted spatial transcriptomics.	Targeted spatial transcriptomics hold particular promise in analyzing complex tissues. Most such methods, however, measure only a limited panel of transcripts, which need to be selected in advance to inform on the cell types or processes being studied. A limitation of existing gene selection methods is their reliance on scRNA-seq data, ignoring platform effects between technologies. Here we describe gpsFISH, a computational method performing gene selection through optimizing detection of known cell types. By modeling and adjusting for platform effects, gpsFISH outperforms other methods. Furthermore, gpsFISH can incorporate cell type hierarchies and custom gene preferences to accommodate diverse design requirements.
40790237	2025	Genome biology	spVelo: RNA velocity inference for multi-batch spatial transcriptomics data.	RNA velocity has emerged as a powerful tool to interpret transcriptional dynamics and infer trajectory from snapshot datasets. However, current methods fail to utilize the spatial information inherent in spatial transcriptomics and lack scalability in multi-batch datasets. Here, we introduce spVelo, a scalable framework for RNA velocity inference of multi-batch spatial transcriptomics data. spVelo supports several downstream applications, including uncertainty quantification, complex trajectory pattern discovery, driver marker identification, gene regulatory network inference, and temporal cell-cell communication inference. spVelo has the potential to provide deeper insights into complex tissue organization and underscore biological mechanisms based on spatially resolved patterns.
39692449	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	MORE: a multi-omics data-driven hypergraph integration network for biomedical data classification and biomarker identification.	High-throughput sequencing methods have brought about a huge change in omics-based biomedical study. Integrating various omics data is possibly useful for identifying some correlations across data modalities, thus improving our understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms and complexity. Nevertheless, most existing graph-based feature extraction methods overlook the complementary information and correlations across modalities. Moreover, these methods tend to treat the features of each omics modality equally, which contradicts current biological principles. To solve these challenges, we introduce a novel approach for integrating multi-omics data termed Multi-Omics hypeRgraph integration nEtwork (MORE). MORE initially constructs a comprehensive hyperedge group by extensively investigating the informative correlations within and across modalities. Subsequently, the multi-omics hypergraph encoding module is employed to learn the enriched omics-specific information. Afterward, the multi-omics self-attention mechanism is then utilized to adaptatively aggregate valuable correlations across modalities for representation learning and making the final prediction. We assess MORE's performance on datasets characterized by message RNA (mRNA) expression, Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) methylation, and microRNA (miRNA) expression for Alzheimer's disease, invasive breast carcinoma, and glioblastoma. The results from three classification tasks highlight the competitive advantage of MORE in contrast with current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Moreover, the results also show that MORE has the capability to identify a greater variety of disease-related biomarkers compared to existing methods, highlighting its advantages in biomedical data mining and interpretation. Overall, MORE can be investigated as a valuable tool for facilitating multi-omics analysis and novel biomarker discovery. Our code and data can be publicly accessed at https://github.com/Wangyuhanxx/MORE.
34146105	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Bayesian modeling of spatial molecular profiling data via Gaussian process.	MOTIVATION: The location, timing and abundance of gene expression (both mRNA and proteins) within a tissue define the molecular mechanisms of cell functions. Recent technology breakthroughs in spatial molecular profiling, including imaging-based technologies and sequencing-based technologies, have enabled the comprehensive molecular characterization of single cells while preserving their spatial and morphological contexts. This new bioinformatics scenario calls for effective and robust computational methods to identify genes with spatial patterns. RESULTS: We represent a novel Bayesian hierarchical model to analyze spatial transcriptomics data, with several unique characteristics. It models the zero-inflated and over-dispersed counts by deploying a zero-inflated negative binomial model that greatly increases model stability and robustness. Besides, the Bayesian inference framework allows us to borrow strength in parameter estimation in a de novo fashion. As a result, the proposed model shows competitive performances in accuracy and robustness over existing methods in both simulation studies and two real data applications. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The related R/C++ source code is available at https://github.com/Minzhe/BOOST-GP.

40954300	2025	Nature methods	Scaling up spatial transcriptomics for large-sized tissues: uncovering cellular-level tissue architecture beyond conventional platforms with iSCALE.	Recent advances in spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies have transformed our ability to profile gene expression while preserving crucial spatial context within tissues. However, existing ST platforms are constrained by high costs, long turnaround times, low resolution, limited gene coverage and inherently small tissue capture areas, which hinder their broad applications. Here we present iSCALE, a method that reconstructs large-scale, super-resolution gene expression landscapes and automatically annotates cellular-level tissue architecture in samples exceeding capture areas of current ST platforms. The performance of iSCALE was assessed by comprehensive evaluations involving benchmarking experiments, immunohistochemistry staining and manual annotations by pathologists. When applied to multiple sclerosis human brain samples, iSCALE uncovered lesion-associated cellular characteristics undetectable by conventional ST experiments. Our results demonstrate the utility of iSCALE in analyzing large tissues by enabling unbiased annotation, resolving cell type composition, mapping cellular microenvironments and revealing spatial features beyond the reach of standard ST analysis or routine histopathological assessment.
40536815	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Advances and challenges in cell-cell communication inference: a comprehensive review of tools, resources, and future directions.	Recent advancements in high-resolution and high-throughput sequencing technologies have significantly enhanced the study of cell-cell communication inference using single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data. Over the past 6 years, this growing interest has led to the development of more than 100 bioinformatics tools and nearly 50 resources, primarily in the form of ligand-receptor databases. These tools vary widely in their requirements, scoring approaches, ability to infer inter- and/or intra-cellular communication, assumptions, and limitations. Similarly, cell-cell communication resources differ in many aspects, mainly in the number of annotated interactions, species coverage, and their focus on inter-cellular signaling or both inter- and intra-cellular communication. This abundance and diversity create challenges in identifying compatible and suitable tools and resources to meet specific user needs. In this collaborative effort, we aim to provide a comprehensive report on the current state of cell-cell communication analysis derived from single-cell or spatial transcriptomics data. The report reviews existing methods and resources, addressing all relevant aspects from the user's perspective. It also explores current limitations, pitfalls, and unresolved issues in cell-cell communication inference, offering an aggregated analysis of the existing literature on the topic. Furthermore, we highlight potential future directions in the field and consolidate the collected knowledge into CCC-Catalog (https://sysbiobig.gitlab.io/ccc-catalog), a centralized web platform designed to serve as a hub for bioinformaticians and researchers interested in cell-cell communication inference.
30184058	2018	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Bayesian integrative model for multi-omics data with missingness.	MOTIVATION: Integrative analysis of multi-omics data from different high-throughput experimental platforms provides valuable insight into regulatory mechanisms associated with complex diseases, and gains statistical power to detect markers that are otherwise overlooked by single-platform omics analysis. In practice, a significant portion of samples may not be measured completely due to insufficient tissues or restricted budget (e.g. gene expression profile are measured but not methylation). Current multi-omics integrative methods require complete data. A common practice is to ignore samples with any missing platform and perform complete case analysis, which leads to substantial loss of statistical power. METHODS: In this article, inspired by the popular Integrative Bayesian Analysis of Genomics data (iBAG), we propose a full Bayesian model that allows incorporation of samples with missing omics data. RESULTS: Simulation results show improvement of the new full Bayesian approach in terms of outcome prediction accuracy and feature selection performance when sample size is limited and proportion of missingness is large. When sample size is large or the proportion of missingness is low, incorporating samples with missingness may introduce extra inference uncertainty and generate worse prediction and feature selection performance. To determine whether and how to incorporate samples with missingness, we propose a self-learning cross-validation (CV) decision scheme. Simulations and a real application on child asthma dataset demonstrate superior performance of the CV decision scheme when various types of missing mechanisms are evaluated. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Freely available on the GitHub at https://github.com/CHPGenetics/FBM. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
39751646	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	BACT: nonparametric Bayesian cell typing for single-cell spatial transcriptomics data.	The spatial transcriptomics is a rapidly evolving biological technology that simultaneously measures the gene expression profiles and the spatial locations of spots. With progressive advances, current spatial transcriptomic techniques can achieve the cellular or even the subcellular resolution, making it possible to explore the fine-grained spatial pattern of cell types within one tissue section. However, most existing cell spatial clustering methods require a correct specification of the cell type number, which is hard to determine in the practical exploratory data analysis. To address this issue, we present a nonparametric Bayesian model BACT to perform BAyesian Cell Typing by utilizing gene expression information and spatial coordinates of cells. BACT incorporates a nonparametric Potts prior to induce neighboring cells' spatial dependency, and, more importantly, it can automatically learn the cell type number directly from the data without prespecification. Evaluations on three single-cell spatial transcriptomic datasets demonstrate the better performance of BACT than competing spatial cell typing methods. The R package and the user manual of BACT are publicly available at https://github.com/yinqiaoyan/BACT.
40316422	2025	Genome research	Harnessing agent-based frameworks in CellAgentChat to unravel cell-cell interactions from single-cell and spatial transcriptomics.	Understanding cell-cell interactions (CCIs) is essential yet challenging owing to the inherent intricacy and diversity of cellular dynamics. Existing approaches often analyze global patterns of CCIs using statistical frameworks, missing the nuances of individual cell behavior owing to their focus on aggregate data. This makes them insensitive in complex environments where the detailed dynamics of cell interactions matter. We introduce CellAgentChat, an agent-based model (ABM) designed to decipher CCIs from single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics data. This approach models biological systems as collections of autonomous agents governed by biologically inspired principles and rules. Validated across eight diverse single-cell data sets, CellAgentChat demonstrates its effectiveness in detecting intricate signaling events across different cell populations. Moreover, CellAgentChat offers the ability to generate animated visualizations of single-cell interactions and provides flexibility in modifying agent behavior rules, facilitating thorough exploration of both close and distant cellular communications. Furthermore, CellAgentChat leverages ABM features to enable intuitive in silico perturbations via agent rule modifications, facilitating the development of novel intervention strategies. This ABM method unlocks an in-depth understanding of cellular signaling interactions across various biological contexts, thereby enhancing in silico studies for cellular communication-based therapies.
32770205	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	Spatial molecular profiling: platforms, applications and analysis tools.	Molecular profiling technologies, such as genome sequencing and proteomics, have transformed biomedical research, but most such technologies require tissue dissociation, which leads to loss of tissue morphology and spatial information. Recent developments in spatial molecular profiling technologies have enabled the comprehensive molecular characterization of cells while keeping their spatial and morphological contexts intact. Molecular profiling data generate deep characterizations of the genetic, transcriptional and proteomic events of cells, while tissue images capture the spatial locations, organizations and interactions of the cells together with their morphology features. These data, together with cell and tissue imaging data, provide unprecedented opportunities to study tissue heterogeneity and cell spatial organization. This review aims to provide an overview of these recent developments in spatial molecular profiling technologies and the corresponding computational methods developed for analyzing such data.
36253792	2022	Genome biology	Evaluation of cell-cell interaction methods by integrating single-cell RNA sequencing data with spatial information.	BACKGROUND: Cell-cell interactions are important for information exchange between different cells, which are the fundamental basis of many biological processes. Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enable the characterization of cell-cell interactions using computational methods. However, it is hard to evaluate these methods since no ground truth is provided. Spatial transcriptomics (ST) data profiles the relative position of different cells. We propose that the spatial distance suggests the interaction tendency of different cell types, thus could be used for evaluating cell-cell interaction tools. RESULTS: We benchmark 16 cell-cell interaction methods by integrating scRNA-seq with ST data. We characterize cell-cell interactions into short-range and long-range interactions using spatial distance distributions between ligands and receptors. Based on this classification, we define the distance enrichment score and apply an evaluation workflow to 16 cell-cell interaction tools using 15 simulated and 5 real scRNA-seq and ST datasets. We also compare the consistency of the results from single tools with the commonly identified interactions. Our results suggest that the interactions predicted by different tools are highly dynamic, and the statistical-based methods show overall better performance than network-based methods and ST-based methods. CONCLUSIONS: Our study presents a comprehensive evaluation of cell-cell interaction tools for scRNA-seq. CellChat, CellPhoneDB, NicheNet, and ICELLNET show overall better performance than other tools in terms of consistency with spatial tendency and software scalability. We recommend using results from at least two methods to ensure the accuracy of identified interactions. We have packaged the benchmark workflow with detailed documentation at GitHub ( https://github.com/wanglabtongji/CCI ).
38082294	2023	Genome biology	SQANTI-SIM: a simulator of controlled transcript novelty for lrRNA-seq benchmark.	Long-read RNA sequencing has emerged as a powerful tool for transcript discovery, even in well-annotated organisms. However, assessing the accuracy of different methods in identifying annotated and novel transcripts remains a challenge. Here, we present SQANTI-SIM, a versatile tool that wraps around popular long-read simulators to allow precise management of transcript novelty based on the structural categories defined by SQANTI3. By selectively excluding specific transcripts from the reference dataset, SQANTI-SIM effectively emulates scenarios involving unannotated transcripts. Furthermore, the tool provides customizable features and supports the simulation of additional types of data, representing the first multi-omics simulation tool for the lrRNA-seq field.
40038818	2025	Genome biology	Benchmarking single-cell cross-omics imputation methods for surface protein expression.	BACKGROUND: Recent advances in single-cell multimodal omics sequencing have facilitated the simultaneous profiling of transcriptomes and surface proteomes within individual cells, offering insights into cellular functions and heterogeneity. However, the high costs and technical complexity of protocols like CITE-seq and REAP-seq constrain large-scale dataset generation. To overcome this limitation, surface protein data imputation methods have emerged to predict protein abundances from scRNA-seq data. RESULTS: We present a comprehensive benchmark of twelve state-of-the-art imputation methods across eleven datasets and six scenarios. Our analysis evaluates the methods' accuracy, sensitivity to training data size, robustness across experiments, and usability in terms of running time, memory usage, popularity, and user-friendliness. With benchmark experiments in diverse scenarios and a comprehensive evaluation framework of the results, our study offers valuable insights into the performance and applicability of surface protein data imputation methods in single-cell omics research. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our results, Seurat v4 (PCA) and Seurat v3 (PCA) demonstrate exceptional performance, offering promising avenues for further research in single-cell omics.
38300758	2024	Nucleic acids research	Tet-mediated DNA methylation dynamics affect chromosome organization.	DNA Methylation is a significant epigenetic modification that can modulate chromosome states, but its role in orchestrating chromosome organization has not been well elucidated. Here we systematically assessed the effects of DNA Methylation on chromosome organization with a multi-omics strategy to capture DNA Methylation and high-order chromosome interaction simultaneously on mouse embryonic stem cells with DNA methylation dioxygenase Tet triple knock-out (Tet-TKO). Globally, upon Tet-TKO, we observed weakened compartmentalization, corresponding to decreased methylation differences between CpG island (CGI) rich and poor domains. Tet-TKO could also induce hypermethylation for the CTCF binding peaks in TAD boundaries and chromatin loop anchors. Accordingly, CTCF peak generally weakened upon Tet-TKO, which results in weakened TAD structure and depletion of long-range chromatin loops. Genes that lost enhancer-promoter looping upon Tet-TKO showed DNA hypermethylation in their gene bodies, which may compensate for the disruption of gene expression. We also observed distinct effects of Tet1 and Tet2 on chromatin organization and increased DNA methylation correlation on spatially interacted fragments upon Tet inactivation. Our work showed the broad effects of Tet inactivation and DNA methylation dynamics on chromosome organization.
30668675	2019	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	The ReproGenomics Viewer: a multi-omics and cross-species resource compatible with single-cell studies for the reproductive science community.	MOTIVATION: Recent advances in transcriptomics have enabled unprecedented insight into gene expression analysis at a single-cell resolution. While it is anticipated that the number of publications based on such technologies will increase in the next decade, there is currently no public resource to centralize and enable scientists to explore single-cell datasets published in the field of reproductive biology. RESULTS: Here, we present a major update of the ReproGenomics Viewer, a cross-species and cross-technology web-based resource of manually-curated sequencing datasets related to reproduction. The redesign of the ReproGenomics Viewer's architecture is accompanied by significant growth of the database content including several landmark single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets. The implementation of additional tools enables users to visualize and browse the complex, high-dimensional data now being generated in the reproductive field. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The ReproGenomics Viewer resource is freely accessible at http://rgv.genouest.org. The website is implemented in Python, JavaScript and MongoDB, and is compatible with all major browsers. Source codes can be downloaded from https://github.com/fchalmel/RGV.

38678389	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	scBOL: a universal cell type identification framework for single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data.	MOTIVATION: Over the past decade, single-cell transcriptomic technologies have experienced remarkable advancements, enabling the simultaneous profiling of gene expressions across thousands of individual cells. Cell type identification plays an essential role in exploring tissue heterogeneity and characterizing cell state differences. With more and more well-annotated reference data becoming available, massive automatic identification methods have sprung up to simplify the annotation process on unlabeled target data by transferring the cell type knowledge. However, in practice, the target data often include some novel cell types that are not in the reference data. Most existing works usually classify these private cells as one generic 'unassigned' group and learn the features of known and novel cell types in a coupled way. They are susceptible to the potential batch effects and fail to explore the fine-grained semantic knowledge of novel cell types, thus hurting the model's discrimination ability. Additionally, emerging spatial transcriptomic technologies, such as in situ hybridization, sequencing and multiplexed imaging, present a novel challenge to current cell type identification strategies that predominantly neglect spatial organization. Consequently, it is imperative to develop a versatile method that can proficiently annotate single-cell transcriptomics data, encompassing both spatial and non-spatial dimensions. RESULTS: To address these issues, we propose a new, challenging yet realistic task called universal cell type identification for single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data. In this task, we aim to give semantic labels to target cells from known cell types and cluster labels to those from novel ones. To tackle this problem, instead of designing a suboptimal two-stage approach, we propose an end-to-end algorithm called scBOL from the perspective of Bipartite prototype alignment. Firstly, we identify the mutual nearest clusters in reference and target data as their potential common cell types. On this basis, we mine the cycle-consistent semantic anchor cells to build the intrinsic structure association between two data. Secondly, we design a neighbor-aware prototypical learning paradigm to strengthen the inter-cluster separability and intra-cluster compactness within each data, thereby inspiring the discriminative feature representations. Thirdly, driven by the semantic-aware prototypical learning framework, we can align the known cell types and separate the private cell types from them among reference and target data. Such an algorithm can be seamlessly applied to various data types modeled by different foundation models that can generate the embedding features for cells. Specifically, for non-spatial single-cell transcriptomics data, we use the autoencoder neural network to learn latent low-dimensional cell representations, and for spatial single-cell transcriptomics data, we apply the graph convolution network to capture molecular and spatial similarities of cells jointly. Extensive results on our carefully designed evaluation benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of scBOL over various state-of-the-art cell type identification methods. To our knowledge, we are the pioneers in presenting this pragmatic annotation task, as well as in devising a comprehensive algorithmic framework aimed at resolving this challenge across varied types of single-cell data. Finally, scBOL is implemented in Python using the Pytorch machine-learning library, and it is freely available at https://github.com/aimeeyaoyao/scBOL.
37395437	2023	Nucleic acids research	Integration of gene expression and DNA methylation data across different experiments.	Integrative analysis of multi-omic datasets has proven to be extremely valuable in cancer research and precision medicine. However, obtaining multimodal data from the same samples is often difficult. Integrating multiple datasets of different omics remains a challenge, with only a few available algorithms developed to solve it. Here, we present INTEND (IntegratioN of Transcriptomic and EpigeNomic Data), a novel algorithm for integrating gene expression and DNA methylation datasets covering disjoint sets of samples. To enable integration, INTEND learns a predictive model between the two omics by training on multi-omic data measured on the same set of samples. In comprehensive testing on 11 TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) cancer datasets spanning 4329 patients, INTEND achieves significantly superior results compared with four state-of-the-art integration algorithms. We also demonstrate INTEND's ability to uncover connections between DNA methylation and the regulation of gene expression in the joint analysis of two lung adenocarcinoma single-omic datasets from different sources. INTEND's data-driven approach makes it a valuable multi-omic data integration tool. The code for INTEND is available at https://github.com/Shamir-Lab/INTEND.
38347138	2024	Nature methods	TISSUE: uncertainty-calibrated prediction of single-cell spatial transcriptomics improves downstream analyses.	Whole-transcriptome spatial profiling of genes at single-cell resolution remains a challenge. To address this limitation, spatial gene expression prediction methods have been developed to infer the spatial expression of unmeasured transcripts, but the quality of these predictions can vary greatly. Here we present Transcript Imputation with Spatial Single-cell Uncertainty Estimation (TISSUE) as a general framework for estimating uncertainty for spatial gene expression predictions and providing uncertainty-aware methods for downstream inference. Leveraging conformal inference, TISSUE provides well-calibrated prediction intervals for predicted expression values across 11 benchmark datasets. Moreover, it consistently reduces the false discovery rate for differential gene expression analysis, improves clustering and visualization of predicted spatial transcriptomics and improves the performance of supervised learning models trained on predicted gene expression profiles. Applying TISSUE to a MERFISH spatial transcriptomics dataset of the adult mouse subventricular zone, we identified subtypes within the neural stem cell lineage and developed subtype-specific regional classifiers.
37379157	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	MDTips: a multimodal-data-based drug-target interaction prediction system fusing knowledge, gene expression profile, and structural data.	MOTIVATION: Screening new drug-target interactions (DTIs) by traditional experimental methods is costly and time-consuming. Recent advances in knowledge graphs, chemical linear notations, and genomic data enable researchers to develop computational-based-DTI models, which play a pivotal role in drug repurposing and discovery. However, there still needs to develop a multimodal fusion DTI model that integrates available heterogeneous data into a unified framework. RESULTS: We developed MDTips, a multimodal-data-based DTI prediction system, by fusing the knowledge graphs, gene expression profiles, and structural information of drugs/targets. MDTips yielded accurate and robust performance on DTI predictions. We found that multimodal fusion learning can fully consider the importance of each modality and incorporate information from multiple aspects, thus improving model performance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that deep learning-based encoders (i.e. Attentive FP and Transformer) outperform traditional chemical descriptors/fingerprints, and MDTips outperforms other state-of-the-art prediction models. MDTips is designed to predict the input drugs' candidate targets, side effects, and indications with all available modalities. Via MDTips, we reverse-screened candidate targets of 6766 drugs, which can be used for drug repurposing and discovery. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: https://github.com/XiaoqiongXia/MDTips and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7560544.
35909238	2022	Nucleic acids research	Cluster-independent marker feature identification from single-cell omics data using SEMITONES.	Identification of cell identity markers is an essential step in single-cell omics data analysis. Current marker identification strategies typically rely on cluster assignments of cells. However, cluster assignment, particularly for developmental data, is nontrivial, potentially arbitrary, and commonly relies on prior knowledge. In response, we present SEMITONES, a principled method for cluster-free marker identification. We showcase and evaluate its application for marker gene and regulatory region identification from single-cell data of the human haematopoietic system. Additionally, we illustrate its application to spatial transcriptomics data and show how SEMITONES can be used for the annotation of cells given known marker genes. Using several simulated and curated data sets, we demonstrate that SEMITONES qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms existing methods for the retrieval of cell identity markers from single-cell omics data.
41093751	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	BIWT: a bioinformatics walkthrough for embedding spatial multiomics in agent-based models for virtual cells.

We present the BioInformatics WalkThrough (BIWT) software to directly initialize spatial agent-based models from single-cell and spatial molecular data. We demonstrate how initialization strategies affect tumor-immune dynamics and spatial clustering, positioning BIWT as a software suite to generate data-driven virtual cells representing both experimental and clinical contexts.

37930028	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	scMHNN: a novel hypergraph neural network for integrative analysis of single-cell epigenomic, transcriptomic and proteomic data.	Technological advances have now made it possible to simultaneously profile the changes of epigenomic, transcriptomic and proteomic at the single cell level, allowing a more unified view of cellular phenotypes and heterogeneities. However, current computational tools for single-cell multi-omics data integration are mainly tailored for bi-modality data, so new tools are urgently needed to integrate tri-modality data with complex associations. To this end, we develop scMHNN to integrate single-cell multi-omics data based on hypergraph neural network. After modeling the complex data associations among various modalities, scMHNN performs message passing process on the multi-omics hypergraph, which can capture the high-order data relationships and integrate the multiple heterogeneous features. Followingly, scMHNN learns discriminative cell representation via a dual-contrastive loss in self-supervised manner. Based on the pretrained hypergraph encoder, we further introduce the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm, which allows more accurate cell-type annotation with only a small number of labeled cells as reference. Benchmarking results on real and simulated single-cell tri-modality datasets indicate that scMHNN outperforms other competing methods on both cell clustering and cell-type annotation tasks. In addition, we also demonstrate scMHNN facilitates various downstream tasks, such as cell marker detection and enrichment analysis.
41071613	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Spatial transcriptomic data denoising and domain identification by a community strength-augmented graph autoencoder.	The rapid development of spatial sequencing technologies has generated large amounts of spatial transcriptomic data, which provide an opportunity to explore complex tissue structures and functional domains. However, such data often suffer from high noise and sparsity, which bring a big challenge for deciphering spatial domains and further understanding the structural and functional organization of biological tissues. In this study, we propose a novel method named Community Strength-Augmented (CSA) that incorporates community strength-augmented graph autoencoder by considering spatially heterogenous structures. Moreover, attention mechanism is designed in CSA to take full advantage of both spatial transcriptomic data and corresponding histology image information. We applied CSA to several spatial transcriptomic datasets derived from various platforms. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, CSA exhibits superiority in revealing spatially functional domains. Moreover, CSA is able to denoise the data, enabling the identification of biologically meaningful marker genes.
41052280	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Network based simultaneous embedding of cells and marker genes from scRNA-seq studies.	The complexity of scRNA-sequencing datasets highlights the urgent need for enhanced clustering and visualization methods. Here, we propose Stardust, an iterative, force-directed graph layout algorithm that enables the simultaneous embedding of cells and marker genes. Stardust, for the first time, allows a single-stop visualization of cells and marker genes on a single 2D map. While Stardust provides its own visualization pipeline, it can be plugged in with state-of-the-art methods such as Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE). We benchmarked Stardust against popular visualization and clustering tools on both scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics datasets. In all cases, Stardust performs competitively in identifying and visualizing cell types in an accurate and spatially coherent manner.
36215030	2023	Nucleic acids research	CottonMD: a multi-omics database for cotton biological study.	Cotton is an important economic crop, and many loci for important traits have been identified, but it remains challenging and time-consuming to identify candidate or causal genes/variants and clarify their roles in phenotype formation and regulation. Here, we first collected and integrated the multi-omics datasets including 25 genomes, transcriptomes in 76 tissue samples, epigenome data of five species and metabolome data of 768 metabolites from four tissues, and genetic variation, trait and transcriptome datasets from 4180 cotton accessions. Then, a cotton multi-omics database (CottonMD, http://yanglab.hzau.edu.cn/CottonMD/) was constructed. In CottonMD, multiple statistical methods were applied to identify the associations between variations and phenotypes, and many easy-to-use analysis tools were provided to help researchers quickly acquire the related omics information and perform multi-omics data analysis. Two case studies demonstrated the power of CottonMD for identifying and analyzing the candidate genes, as well as the great potential of integrating multi-omics data for cotton genetic breeding and functional genomics research.
38271483	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	scCorrector: a robust method for integrating multi-study single-cell data.	The advent of single-cell sequencing technologies has revolutionized cell biology studies. However, integrative analyses of diverse single-cell data face serious challenges, including technological noise, sample heterogeneity, and different modalities and species. To address these problems, we propose scCorrector, a variational autoencoder-based model that can integrate single-cell data from different studies and map them into a common space. Specifically, we designed a Study Specific Adaptive Normalization for each study in decoder to implement these features. scCorrector substantially achieves competitive and robust performance compared with state-of-the-art methods and brings novel insights under various circumstances (e.g. various batches, multi-omics, cross-species, and development stages). In addition, the integration of single-cell data and spatial data makes it possible to transfer information between different studies, which greatly expand the narrow range of genes covered by MERFISH technology. In summary, scCorrector can efficiently integrate multi-study single-cell datasets, thereby providing broad opportunities to tackle challenges emerging from noisy resources.

36583521	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	bulkAnalyseR: an accessible, interactive pipeline for analysing and sharing bulk multi-modal sequencing data.	Bulk sequencing experiments (single- and multi-omics) are essential for exploring wide-ranging biological questions. To facilitate interactive, exploratory tasks, coupled with the sharing of easily accessible information, we present bulkAnalyseR, a package integrating state-of-the-art approaches using an expression matrix as the starting point (pre-processing functions are available as part of the package). Static summary images are replaced with interactive panels illustrating quality-checking, differential expression analysis (with noise detection) and biological interpretation (enrichment analyses, identification of expression patterns, followed by inference and comparison of regulatory interactions). bulkAnalyseR can handle different modalities, facilitating robust integration and comparison of cis-, trans- and customised regulatory networks.
39529126	2024	Genome biology	SpottedPy quantifies relationships between spatial transcriptomic hotspots and uncovers environmental cues of epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity in breast cancer.	Spatial transcriptomics is revolutionizing the exploration of intratissue heterogeneity in cancer, yet capturing cellular niches and their spatial relationships remains challenging. We introduce SpottedPy, a Python package designed to identify tumor hotspots and map spatial interactions within the cancer ecosystem. Using SpottedPy, we examine epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity in breast cancer and highlight stable niches associated with angiogenic and hypoxic regions, shielded by CAFs and macrophages. Hybrid and mesenchymal hotspot distribution follows transformation gradients reflecting progressive immunosuppression. Our method offers flexibility to explore spatial relationships at different scales, from immediate neighbors to broader tissue modules, providing new insights into tumor microenvironment dynamics.
38936341	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	ScType enables fast and accurate cell type identification from spatial transcriptomics data.	SUMMARY: The limited resolution of spatial transcriptomics (ST) assays in the past has led to the development of cell type annotation methods that separate the convolved signal based on available external atlas data. In light of the rapidly increasing resolution of the ST assay technologies, we made available and investigated the performance of a deconvolution-free marker-based cell annotation method called scType. In contrast to existing methods, the spatial application of scType does not require computationally strenuous deconvolution, nor large single-cell reference atlases. We show that scType enables ultra-fast and accurate identification of abundant cell types from ST data, especially when a large enough panel of genes is detected. Examples of such assays are Visium and Slide-seq, which currently offer the best trade-off between high resolution and number of genes detected by the assay for cell type annotation. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: scType source R and python codes for spatial data are openly available in GitHub (https://github.com/kris-nader/sp-type or https://github.com/kris-nader/sc-type-py). Step-by-step tutorials for R and python spatial data analysis can be found in https://github.com/kris-nader/sp-type and https://github.com/kris-nader/sc-type-py/blob/main/spatial_tutorial.md, respectively.
38940181	2024	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Adaptive digital tissue deconvolution.	MOTIVATION: The inference of cellular compositions from bulk and spatial transcriptomics data increasingly complements data analyses. Multiple computational approaches were suggested and recently, machine learning techniques were developed to systematically improve estimates. Such approaches allow to infer additional, less abundant cell types. However, they rely on training data which do not capture the full biological diversity encountered in transcriptomics analyses; data can contain cellular contributions not seen in the training data and as such, analyses can be biased or blurred. Thus, computational approaches have to deal with unknown, hidden contributions. Moreover, most methods are based on cellular archetypes which serve as a reference; e.g. a generic T-cell profile is used to infer the proportion of T-cells. It is well known that cells adapt their molecular phenotype to the environment and that pre-specified cell archetypes can distort the inference of cellular compositions. RESULTS: We propose Adaptive Digital Tissue Deconvolution (ADTD) to estimate cellular proportions of pre-selected cell types together with possibly unknown and hidden background contributions. Moreover, ADTD adapts prototypic reference profiles to the molecular environment of the cells, which further resolves cell-type specific gene regulation from bulk transcriptomics data. We verify this in simulation studies and demonstrate that ADTD improves existing approaches in estimating cellular compositions. In an application to bulk transcriptomics data from breast cancer patients, we demonstrate that ADTD provides insights into cell-type specific molecular differences between breast cancer subtypes. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: A python implementation of ADTD and a tutorial are available at Gitlab and zenodo (doi:10.5281/zenodo.7548362).
36396787	2022	Nature methods	RS-FISH: precise, interactive, fast, and scalable FISH spot detection.	Fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH)-based methods extract spatially resolved genetic and epigenetic information from biological samples by detecting fluorescent spots in microscopy images, an often challenging task. We present Radial Symmetry-FISH (RS-FISH), an accurate, fast, and user-friendly software for spot detection in two- and three-dimensional images. RS-FISH offers interactive parameter tuning and readily scales to large datasets and image volumes of cleared or expanded samples using distributed processing on workstations, clusters, or the cloud. RS-FISH maintains high detection accuracy and low localization error across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios, a key feature for single-molecule FISH, spatial transcriptomics, or spatial genomics applications.
37231261	2024	Nature biotechnology	Dictionary learning for integrative, multimodal and scalable single-cell analysis.	Mapping single-cell sequencing profiles to comprehensive reference datasets provides a powerful alternative to unsupervised analysis. However, most reference datasets are constructed from single-cell RNA-sequencing data and cannot be used to annotate datasets that do not measure gene expression. Here we introduce 'bridge integration', a method to integrate single-cell datasets across modalities using a multiomic dataset as a molecular bridge. Each cell in the multiomic dataset constitutes an element in a 'dictionary', which is used to reconstruct unimodal datasets and transform them into a shared space. Our procedure accurately integrates transcriptomic data with independent single-cell measurements of chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, DNA methylation and protein levels. Moreover, we demonstrate how dictionary learning can be combined with sketching techniques to improve computational scalability and harmonize 8.6 million human immune cell profiles from sequencing and mass cytometry experiments. Our approach, implemented in version 5 of our Seurat toolkit ( http://www.satijalab.org/seurat ), broadens the utility of single-cell reference datasets and facilitates comparisons across diverse molecular modalities.
41163012	2025	Genome biology	Cross-expression meta-analysis of mouse brain slices reveals coordinated gene expression across spatially adjacent cells.	"BACKGROUND: Spatial transcriptomics allow us to ask a fundamental question: how do nearby cells orchestrate their gene expression? Rather than focus on how these cells (samples) communicate with each other, we reframe the problem to investigate how genes (features) coordinate their expression between neighboring cells. To this end, we introduce ""cross-expression,"" which models the degree to which genes coordinate their expression across spatially adjacent cells, avoiding the use of curated databases and cell type labels while controlling for cell-intrinsic processes. RESULTS: We use multiple atlas-scale adult mouse brain datasets (~25 million cells, 695 slices from 52 brains, 8 technologies) to create an integrated, meta-analytic cross-expression network, whose communities are enriched in spatial processes such as synaptic signaling and G protein coupled receptor activity. Highlighting cross-expression's biological utility, our network shows that genes Drd1 and Gpr6, which are individually implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD), are cross-expressed within the striatum, hinting at their joint role in PD pathophysiology. It also recovers ligand-receptor pairs as cross-expressing genes and finds gene combinations that mark anatomical regions, thus complementing cell-cell communication approaches and marker gene-based region annotation, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We offer a gene-centric perspective to understand spatially coordinated expression between neighboring cells. Our method only requires the gene expression and cell location matrices to find cross-expressing gene pairs. The R package is available at https://github.com/gillislab/CrossExpression ."
36723605	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Unsupervised construction of gene regulatory network based on single-cell multi-omics data of colorectal cancer.	Identifying gene regulatory networks (GRNs) at the resolution of single cells has long been a great challenge, and the advent of single-cell multi-omics data provides unprecedented opportunities to construct GRNs. Here, we propose a novel strategy to integrate omics datasets of single-cell ribonucleic acid sequencing and single-cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing, and using an unsupervised learning neural network to divide the samples with high copy number variation scores, which are used to infer the GRN in each gene block. Accuracy validation of proposed strategy shows that approximately 80% of transcription factors are directly associated with cancer, colorectal cancer, malignancy and disease by TRRUST; and most transcription factors are prone to produce multiple transcript variants and lead to tumorigenesis by RegNetwork database, respectively. The source code access are available at: https://github.com/Cuily-v/Colorectal_cancer.
33704427	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	sepal: identifying transcript profiles with spatial patterns by diffusion-based modeling.	MOTIVATION: Collection of spatial signals in large numbers has become a routine task in multiple omics-fields, but parsing of these rich datasets still pose certain challenges. In whole or near-full transcriptome spatial techniques, spurious expression profiles are intermixed with those exhibiting an organized structure. To distinguish profiles with spatial patterns from the background noise, a metric that enables quantification of spatial structure is desirable. Current methods designed for similar purposes tend to be built around a framework of statistical hypothesis testing, hence we were compelled to explore a fundamentally different strategy. RESULTS: We propose an unexplored approach to analyze spatial transcriptomics data, simulating diffusion of individual transcripts to extract genes with spatial patterns. The method performed as expected when presented with synthetic data. When applied to real data, it identified genes with distinct spatial profiles, involved in key biological processes or characteristic for certain cell types. Compared to existing methods, ours seemed to be less informed by the genes' expression levels and showed better time performance when run with multiple cores. AVAILABILITYAND IMPLEMENTATION: Open-source Python package with a command line interface (CLI), freely available at https://github.com/almaan/sepal under an MIT licence. A mirror of the GitHub repository can be found at Zenodo, doi: 10.5281/zenodo.4573237. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

MOTIVATION: High-throughput technologies yield a broad spectrum of multi-omics datasets, which offer unparalleled insights into complex biological systems. However, effectively analyzing this diverse array of data presents challenges, considering factors such as species diversity, data types, costs, and limitations of the available tools. RESULTS: Herein, we present ExpOmics, a comprehensive web platform featuring 7 applications and 4 toolkits, with 28 customizable analysis functions spanning various analyses of differential expression, co-expression, Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), feature selection, and functional enrichment.

The analysis results from ExpOmics are presented in high-quality graphical formats suitable for publication and are available for free download. A case study using ExpOmics identified two potential oncogenes, SERPINE1 and SLC43A1, that may regulate colorectal cancer through distinct biological processes. In summary, ExpOmics can serves as a robust platform for global researchers to explore multi-omics data, gain biological insights, and formulate testable hypotheses.

35585605	2022	Genome biology	Modeling zero inflation is not necessary for spatial transcriptomics.	BACKGROUND: Spatial transcriptomics are a set of new technologies that profile gene expression on tissues with spatial localization information. With technological advances, recent spatial transcriptomics data are often in the form of sparse counts with an excessive amount of zero values. RESULTS: We perform a comprehensive analysis on 20 spatial transcriptomics datasets collected from 11 distinct technologies to characterize the distributional properties of the expression count data and understand the statistical nature of the zero values. Across datasets, we show that a substantial fraction of genes displays overdispersion and/or zero inflation that cannot be accounted for by a Poisson model, with genes displaying overdispersion substantially overlapped with genes displaying zero inflation. In addition, we find that either the Poisson or the negative binomial model is sufficient for modeling the majority of genes across most spatial transcriptomics technologies. We further show major sources of overdispersion and zero inflation in spatial transcriptomics including gene expression heterogeneity across tissue locations and spatial distribution of cell types. In particular, when we focus on a relatively homogeneous set of tissue locations or control for cell type compositions, the number of detected overdispersed and/or zero-inflated genes is substantially reduced, and a simple Poisson model is often sufficient to fit the gene expression data there. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides the first comprehensive evidence that excessive zeros in spatial transcriptomics are not due to zero inflation, supporting the use of count models without a zero inflation component for modeling spatial transcriptomics.
39407253	2024	Genome biology	Multi-omics reveals lactylation-driven regulatory mechanisms promoting tumor progression in oral squamous cell carcinoma.	BACKGROUND: Lactylation, a post-translational modification, is increasingly recognized for its role in cancer progression. This study investigates its prevalence and impact in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). RESULTS: Immunohistochemical staining of 81 OSCC cases shows lactylation levels correlate with malignancy grading. Proteomic analyses of six OSCC tissue pairs reveal 2765 lactylation sites on 1033 proteins, highlighting its extensive presence. These modifications influence metabolic processes, molecular synthesis, and transport. CAL27 cells are subjected to cleavage under targets and tagmentation assay for accessible-chromatin with high-throughput sequencing, and transcriptomic sequencing pre- and post-lactate treatment, with 217 genes upregulated due to lactylation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative PCR and real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR confirm the regulatory role of lactylation at the K146 site of dexh-box helicase 9 (DHX9), a key factor in OSCC progression. CCK8, colony formation, scratch healing, and Transwell assays demonstrate that lactylation mitigates the inhibitory effect of DHX9 on OSCC, thereby promoting its occurrence and development. CONCLUSIONS: Lactylation actively modulates gene expression in OSCC, with significant effects on chromatin structure and cellular processes. This study provides a foundation for developing targeted therapies against OSCC, leveraging the role of lactylation in disease pathogenesis.
38343325	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	ImmuneMirror: A machine learning-based integrative pipeline and web server for neoantigen prediction.	Neoantigens are derived from somatic mutations in the tumors but are absent in normal tissues. Emerging evidence suggests that neoantigens can stimulate tumor-specific T-cell-mediated antitumor immune responses, and therefore are potential immunotherapeutic targets. We developed ImmuneMirror as a stand-alone open-source pipeline and a web server incorporating a balanced random forest model for neoantigen prediction and prioritization. The prediction model was trained and tested using known immunogenic neopeptides collected from 19 published studies. The area under the curve of our trained model was 0.87 based on the testing data. We applied ImmuneMirror to the whole-exome sequencing and RNA sequencing data obtained from gastrointestinal tract cancers including 805 tumors from colorectal cancer (CRC), esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and hepatocellular carcinoma patients. We discovered a subgroup of microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) CRC patients with a low neoantigen load but a high tumor mutation burden (> 10 mutations per Mbp). Although the efficacy of PD-1 blockade has been demonstrated in advanced MSI-H patients, almost half of such patients do not respond well. Our study identified a subset of MSI-H patients who may not benefit from this treatment with lower neoantigen load for major histocompatibility complex I (P < 0.0001) and II (P = 0.0008) molecules, respectively. Additionally, the neopeptide YMCNSSCMGV-TP53G245V, derived from a hotspot mutation restricted by HLA-A02, was identified as a potential actionable target in ESCC. This is so far the largest study to comprehensively evaluate neoantigen prediction models using experimentally validated neopeptides. Our results demonstrate the reliability and effectiveness of ImmuneMirror for neoantigen prediction.
33649586	2021	Nature methods	Fast searches of large collections of single-cell data using scfind.	Single-cell technologies have made it possible to profile millions of cells, but for these resources to be useful they must be easy to query and access. To facilitate interactive and intuitive access to single-cell data we have developed scfind, a single-cell analysis tool that facilitates fast search of biologically or clinically relevant marker genes in cell atlases. Using transcriptome data from six mouse cell atlases, we show how scfind can be used to evaluate marker genes, perform in silico gating, and identify both cell-type-specific and housekeeping genes. Moreover, we have developed a subquery optimization routine to ensure that long and complex queries return meaningful results. To make scfind more user friendly, we use indices of PubMed abstracts and techniques from natural language processing to allow for arbitrary queries. Finally, we show how scfind can be used for multi-omics analyses by combining single-cell ATAC-seq data with transcriptome data.
40163555	2025	PLoS computational biology	Anticancer drug response prediction integrating multi-omics pathway-based difference features and multiple deep learning techniques.	Individualized prediction of cancer drug sensitivity is of vital importance in precision medicine. While numerous predictive methodologies for cancer drug response have been proposed, the precise prediction of an individual patient's response to drug and a thorough understanding of differences in drug responses among individuals continue to pose significant challenges. This study introduced a deep learning model PASO, which integrated transformer encoder, multi-scale convolutional networks and attention mechanisms to predict the sensitivity of cell lines to anticancer drugs, based on the omics data of cell lines and the SMILES representations of drug molecules. First, we use statistical methods to compute the differences in gene expression, gene mutation, and gene copy number variations between within and outside biological pathways, and utilized these pathway difference values as cell line features, combined with the drugs' SMILES chemical structure information as inputs to the model. Then the model integrates various deep learning technologies multi-scale convolutional networks and transformer encoder to extract the properties of drug molecules from different perspectives, while an attention network is devoted to learning complex interactions between the omics features of cell lines and the aforementioned properties of drug molecules. Finally, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) outputs the final predictions of drug response. Our model exhibits higher accuracy in predicting the sensitivity to anticancer drugs comparing with other methods proposed recently. It is found that PARP inhibitors, and Topoisomerase I inhibitors were particularly sensitive to SCLC when analyzing the drug response predictions for lung cancer cell lines. Additionally, the model is capable of highlighting biological pathways related to cancer and accurately capturing critical parts of the drug's chemical structure. We also validated the model's clinical utility using clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. In summary, the PASO model suggests potential as a robust support in individualized cancer treatment. Our methods are implemented in Python and are freely available from GitHub (https://github.com/queryang/PASO).
40163697	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	HISSTA: a human in situ single-cell transcriptome atlas.	MOTIVATION: Spatial transcriptomics holds great promise for revolutionizing biology and medicine by providing gene expression profiles with spatial information. Until recently, spatial resolution has been limited, but advances in high-throughput in situ imaging technologies now offer new opportunities by covering thousands of genes at a single-cell or even subcellular resolution, necessitating databases dedicated to comprehensive coverage and analysis with user-friendly intefaces. RESULTS: We introduce the HISSTA database, which facilitates the archival and analysis of in situ transcriptome data at single-cell resolution from various human tissues. We have collected and annotated spatial transcriptome data generated by MERFISH, CosMx SMI, and Xenium techniques, encompassing 112 samples and 28 million cells across 16 tissue types from 63 studies. To decipher spatial contexts, we have implemented advanced tools for cell type annotation, spatial colocalization, spatial cellular communication, and niche analyses. Notably, all datasets and annotations are interactively accessible through Vitessce, allowing users to focus on regions of interest and examine gene expression in detail. HISSTA is a unique database designed to manage the rapidly growing dataset of in situ transcriptomes at single-cell resolution. Given its comprehensive data content and advanced analysis tools with interactive visualizations, HISSTA is poised to significantly impact cancer diagnosis, precision medicine, and digital pathology. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: HISSTA is freely accessible at https://kbds.re.kr/hissta/. The source code is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14904523.
41206950	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	GT-GRN: a graph transformer framework for enhanced gene regulatory network inference via multimodal embedding of expression data and existing network knowledge.	The inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is critical for understanding the regulatory mechanisms underlying cellular development, functional specialization, and disease progression. Predicting regulatory gene interactions-often framed as a link prediction task-is a foundational step toward modeling cellular behavior. However, GRN inference from gene coexpression data alone is limited by noise, low interpretability, and difficulty in capturing indirect regulatory signals. Additionally, challenges such as data sparsity, nonlinearity, and complex gene interactions hinder accurate network reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose, a novel graph transformer (GT) based framework (GT-GRN) that enhances GRN inference by integrating multimodal gene embeddings. Our method combines three complementary sources of information: (i) autoencoder-based embeddings, which capture high-dimensional gene expression patterns while preserving biological signals; (ii) structural embeddings, derived from previously inferred GRNs and encoded via random walks and a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) based language model to learn global gene representations; (iii) positional encodings, capturing each gene's role within the network topology . These heterogeneous features are fused and processed using a GT, allowing the joint modeling of both local and global regulatory structures. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that GT-GRN outperforms existing GRN inference methods in predictive accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, it reconstructs cell-type-specific GRNs with high fidelity and produces gene embeddings that generalize to other tasks such as cell-type annotation.
33619564	2021	Nucleic acids research	Discovery of molecular features underlying the morphological landscape by integrating spatial transcriptomic data with deep features of tissue images.	Profiling molecular features associated with the morphological landscape of tissue is crucial for investigating the structural and spatial patterns that underlie the biological function of tissues. In this study, we present a new method, spatial gene expression patterns by deep learning of tissue images (SPADE), to identify important genes associated with morphological contexts by combining spatial transcriptomic data with coregistered images. SPADE incorporates deep learning-derived image patterns with spatially resolved gene expression data to extract morphological context markers. Morphological features that correspond to spatial maps of the transcriptome were extracted by image patches surrounding each spot and were subsequently represented by image latent features. The molecular profiles correlated with the image latent features were identified. The extracted genes could be further analyzed to discover functional terms and exploited to extract clusters maintaining morphological contexts. We apply our approach to spatial transcriptomic data from different tissues, platforms and types of images to demonstrate an unbiased method that is capable of obtaining image-integrated gene expression trends.
37429992	2023	Nature methods	SCS: cell segmentation for high-resolution spatial transcriptomics.	Spatial transcriptomics promises to greatly improve our understanding of tissue organization and cell-cell interactions. While most current platforms for spatial transcriptomics only offer multi-cellular resolution, with 10-15 cells per spot, recent technologies provide a much denser spot placement leading to subcellular resolution. A key challenge for these newer methods is cell segmentation and the assignment of spots to cells. Traditional image-based segmentation methods are limited and do not make full use of the information profiled by spatial transcriptomics. Here we present subcellular spatial transcriptomics cell segmentation (SCS), which combines imaging data with sequencing data to improve cell segmentation accuracy. SCS assigns spots to cells by adaptively learning the position of each spot relative to the center of its cell using a transformer neural network. SCS was tested on two new subcellular spatial transcriptomics technologies and outperformed traditional image-based segmentation methods. SCS achieved better accuracy, identified more cells and provided more realistic cell size estimation. Subcellular analysis of RNAs using SCS spot assignments provides information on RNA localization and further supports the segmentation results.
37939200	2023	PLoS computational biology	MIGGRI: A multi-instance graph neural network model for inferring gene regulatory networks for Drosophila from spatial expression images.	Recent breakthrough in spatial transcriptomics has brought great opportunities for exploring gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from a brand-new perspective. Especially, the local expression patterns and spatio-temporal regulation mechanisms captured by spatial expression images allow more delicate delineation of the interplay between transcript factors and their target genes. However, the complexity and size of spatial image collections pose significant challenges to GRN inference using image-based methods. Extracting regulatory information from expression images is difficult due to the lack of supervision and the multi-instance nature of the problem, where a gene often corresponds to multiple images captured from different views. While graph models, particularly graph neural networks, have emerged as a promising method for leveraging underlying structure information from known GRNs, incorporating expression images into graphs is not straightforward. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage approach, MIGGRI, for capturing comprehensive regulatory patterns from image collections for each gene and known interactions. Our approach involves a multi-instance graph neural network (GNN) model for GRN inference, which first extracts gene regulatory features from spatial expression images via contrastive learning, and then feeds them to a multi-instance GNN for semi-supervised learning. We apply our approach to a large set of Drosophila embryonic spatial gene expression images. MIGGRI achieves outstanding performance in the inference of GRNs for early eye development and mesoderm development of Drosophila, and shows robustness in the scenarios of missing image information. Additionally, we perform interpretable analysis on image reconstruction and functional subgraphs that may reveal potential pathways or coordinate regulations. By leveraging the power of graph neural networks and the information contained in spatial expression images, our approach has the potential to advance our understanding of gene regulation in complex biological systems.
29931314	2018	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	SCIP: a single-cell image processor toolbox.	SUMMARY: Each cell is a phenotypically unique individual that is influenced by internal and external processes, operating in parallel. To characterize the dynamics of cellular processes one needs to observe many individual cells from multiple points of view and over time, so as to identify commonalities and variability. With this aim, we engineered a software, 'SCIP', to analyze multi-modal, multi-process, time-lapse microscopy morphological and functional images. SCIP is capable of automatic and/or manually corrected segmentation of cells and lineages, automatic alignment of different microscopy channels, as well as detect, count and characterize fluorescent spots (such as RNA tagged by MS2-GFP), nucleoids, Z rings, Min system, inclusion bodies, undefined structures, etc. The results can be exported into *mat files and all results can be jointly analyzed, to allow studying not only each feature and process individually, but also find potential relationships. While we exemplify its use on Escherichia coli, many of its functionalities are expected to be of use in analyzing other prokaryotes and eukaryotic cells as well. We expect SCIP to facilitate the finding of relationships between cellular processes, from small-scale (e.g. gene expression) to large-scale (e.g. cell division), in single cells and cell lineages. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: http://www.ca3-uninova.org/project_scip. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
41212919	2025	PLoS computational biology	Inferring pathway activity from single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data with PaaSc.	Recent advances in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics have revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity. However, translating high-dimensional data into functional pathway insights remains challenging. To address this obstacle, we developed PaaSc (Pathway activity analysis of Single-cell), a computational method for inferring pathway activity at single-cell resolution. PaaSc employs multiple correspondence analysis to simultaneously project cells and genes into a common latent space and selects pathway-associated dimensions through linear regression to infer pathway activity scores. We validated PaaSc across diverse benchmarking datasets, including those that jointly profiled protein and RNA levels, as well as large-scale cancer scRNA-seq cohorts. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, PaaSc demonstrated superior performance in multiple applications: scoring cell type-specific gene sets, identifying cell senescence-associated pathways, and exploring GWAS trait-associated cell types. Importantly, PaaSc maintained accuracy despite batch effects and demonstrated robust performance across different data modalities, including scATAC-seq and spatial transcriptomics data. Our results demonstrate that PaaSc accurately captures dynamic cellular states and spatial patterns, thereby advancing our understanding of cellular dynamics, aging, and disease mechanisms.
38777608	2024	Genome research	Single-cell spatial transcriptomics reveals a dystrophic trajectory following a developmental bifurcation of myoblast cell fates in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy.	"Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is linked to abnormal derepression of the transcription activator DUX4. This effect is localized to a low percentage of cells, requiring single-cell analysis. However, single-cell/nucleus RNA-seq cannot fully capture the transcriptome of multinucleated large myotubes. To circumvent these issues, we use multiplexed error-robust fluorescent in situ hybridization (MERFISH) spatial transcriptomics that allows profiling of RNA transcripts at a subcellular resolution. We simultaneously examined spatial distributions of 140 genes, including 24 direct DUX4 targets, in in vitro differentiated myotubes and unfused mononuclear cells (MNCs) of control, isogenic D4Z4 contraction mutant and FSHD patient samples, as well as the individual nuclei within them. We find myocyte nuclei segregate into two clusters defined by the expression of DUX4 target genes, which is exclusively found in patient/mutant nuclei, whereas MNCs cluster based on developmental states. Patient/mutant myotubes are found in ""FSHD-hi"" and ""FSHD-lo"" states with the former signified by high DUX4 target expression and decreased muscle gene expression. Pseudotime analyses reveal a clear bifurcation of myoblast differentiation into control and FSHD-hi myotube branches, with variable numbers of DUX4 target-expressing nuclei found in multinucleated FSHD-hi myotubes. Gene coexpression modules related to extracellular matrix and stress gene ontologies are significantly altered in patient/mutant myotubes compared with the control. We also identify distinct subpathways within the DUX4 gene network that may differentially contribute to the disease transcriptomic phenotype. Taken together, our MERFISH-based study provides effective gene network profiling of multinucleated cells and identifies FSHD-induced transcriptomic alterations during myoblast differentiation."
39546631	2025	Nucleic acids research	SPathDB: a comprehensive database of spatial pathway activity atlas.	Spatial transcriptomics sequencing technology deepens our understanding of the diversity of cell behaviors, fates and states within complex tissue, which is often determined by the fine-tuning of regulatory network functional activities. Therefore, characterizing the functional activity within tissue space is helpful for revealing the functional features that drive spatial heterogeneity, and understanding complex biological processes. Here, we describe a database, SPathDB (http://bio-bigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/SPathDB/), which aims to dissect the pathway-mediated multidimensional spatial heterogeneity in the context of functional activity. We manually curated spatial transcriptomics datasets and biological pathways from public data resources. SPathDB consists of 1689 868 spatial spots of 695 slices from 84 spatial transcriptome datasets of human and mouse, which involves 36 tissues, and also diseases such as cancer, and provides interactive analysis and visualization of the functional activities of 114 998 pathways across these spatial spots. SPathDB provides five flexible interfaces to retrieve and analyze pathways with highly variable functional activity across spatial spots, the distribution of pathway functional activities along pseudo-space axis, pathway-mediated spatial intercellular communications and the associations between spatial pathway functional activity and the occurrence of cell types. SPathDB will serve as a foundational resource for identifying functional features and elucidating underlying mechanisms of spatial heterogeneity.
36424441	2022	Nature methods	Image-seq: spatially resolved single-cell sequencing guided by in situ and in vivo imaging.	Tissue function depends on cellular organization. While the properties of individual cells are increasingly being deciphered using powerful single-cell sequencing technologies, understanding their spatial organization and temporal evolution remains a major challenge. Here, we present Image-seq, a technology that provides single-cell transcriptional data on cells that are isolated from specific spatial locations under image guidance, thus preserving the spatial information of the target cells. It is compatible with in situ and in vivo imaging and can document the temporal and dynamic history of the cells being analyzed. Cell samples are isolated from intact tissue and processed with state-of-the-art library preparation protocols. The technique therefore combines spatial information with highly sensitive RNA sequencing readouts from individual, intact cells. We have used both high-throughput, droplet-based sequencing as well as SMARTseq-v4 library preparation to demonstrate its application to bone marrow and leukemia biology. We discovered that DPP4 is a highly upregulated gene during early progression of acute myeloid leukemia and that it marks a more proliferative subpopulation that is confined to specific bone marrow microenvironments. Furthermore, the ability of Image-seq to isolate viable, intact cells should make it compatible with a range of downstream single-cell analysis tools including multi-omics protocols.
40220278	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	Multi-Manifolds fusing hyperbolic graph network balanced by pareto optimization for identifying spatial domains of spatial transcriptomics.	Identifying spatial domains for spatial transcriptomics is crucial for achieving comprehensive insights into the pathogenesis of gene expression. Increasingly, computational methods based on graph neural networks are being developed for spatial transcriptomics. However, previous methods have solely focused on the Euclidean manifold. To effectively exploit and explore the informative and deeper topological structures of inherent manifolds, we presented a Multi-Manifolds fusing hyperbolic graph network, balanced by Pareto optimization, for identifying spatial domains in Spatial Transcriptomics (MManiST). First, we developed multi-manifolds encoders for distinct manifolds using the hyperbolic neural network. Features from different manifolds were then combined using an attention mechanism, with multiple reconstruction losses balanced by Pareto optimization. Extensive experiments on commonly used benchmark datasets show that our method consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we investigated the validity of each component and the impact of fusion methods in ablation experiments.
39511664	2024	Genome biology	GraphPCA: a fast and interpretable dimension reduction algorithm for spatial transcriptomics data.	The rapid advancement of spatial transcriptomics technologies has revolutionized our understanding of cell heterogeneity and intricate spatial structures within tissues and organs. However, the high dimensionality and noise in spatial transcriptomic data present significant challenges for downstream data analyses. Here, we develop GraphPCA, an interpretable and quasi-linear dimension reduction algorithm that leverages the strengths of graphical regularization and principal component analysis. Comprehensive evaluations on simulated and multi-resolution spatial transcriptomic datasets generated from various platforms demonstrate the capacity of GraphPCA to enhance downstream analysis tasks including spatial domain detection, denoising, and trajectory inference compared to other state-of-the-art methods.
39870864	2025	Nature methods	Multiplexed spatial mapping of chromatin features, transcriptome and proteins in tissues.	The phenotypic and functional states of cells are modulated by a complex interactive molecular hierarchy of multiple omics layers, involving the genome, epigenome, transcriptome, proteome and metabolome. Spatial omics approaches have enabled the study of these layers in tissue context but are often limited to one or two modalities, offering an incomplete view of cellular identity. Here we present spatial-Mux-seq, a multimodal spatial technology that allows simultaneous profiling of five different modalities: two histone modifications, chromatin accessibility, whole transcriptome and a panel of proteins at tissue scale and cellular level in a spatially resolved manner. We applied this technology to mouse embryos and mouse brains, generating detailed multimodal tissue maps that identified more cell types and states compared to unimodal data. This analysis uncovered spatiotemporal relationships among histone modifications, chromatin accessibility, gene expression and protein levels during neuron differentiation, and revealed a radial glia niche with spatially dynamic epigenetic signals. Collectively, the spatial multi-omics approach heralds a new era for characterizing tissue and cellular heterogeneity that single-modality studies alone could not reveal.
39992219	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	COME: contrastive mapping learning for spatial reconstruction of single-cell RNA sequencing data.	MOTIVATION: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables high-throughput transcriptomic profiling at single-cell resolution. The inherent spatial location is crucial for understanding how single cells orchestrate multicellular functions and drive diseases. However, spatial information is often lost during tissue dissociation. Spatial transcriptomic (ST) technologies can provide precise spatial gene expression atlas, while their practicality is constrained by the number of genes they can assay or the associated costs at a larger scale and the fine-grained cell-type annotation. By transferring knowledge between scRNA-seq and ST data through cell correspondence learning, it is possible to recover the spatial properties inherent in scRNA-seq datasets. RESULTS: In this study, we introduce COME, a COntrastive Mapping lEarning approach that learns mapping between ST and scRNA-seq data to recover the spatial information of scRNA-seq data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed COME method effectively captures precise cell-spot relationships and outperforms previous methods in recovering spatial location for scRNA-seq data. More importantly, our method is capable of precisely identifying biologically meaningful information within the data, such as the spatial structure of missing genes, spatial hierarchical patterns, and the cell-type compositions for each spot. These results indicate that the proposed COME method can help to understand the heterogeneity and activities among cells within tissue environments. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The COME is freely available in GitHub (https://github.com/cindyway/COME).
33681976	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Integrative survival analysis of breast cancer with gene expression and DNA methylation data.	MOTIVATION: Integrative multi-feature fusion analysis on biomedical data has gained much attention recently. In breast cancer, existing studies have demonstrated that combining genomic mRNA data and DNA methylation data can better stratify cancer patients with distinct prognosis than using single signature. However, those existing methods are simply combining these gene features in series and have ignored the correlations between separate omics dimensions over time. RESULTS: In the present study, we propose an adaptive multi-task learning method, which combines the Cox loss task with the ordinal loss task, for survival prediction of breast cancer patients using multi-modal learning instead of performing survival analysis on each feature dataset. First, we use local maximum quasi-clique merging (lmQCM) algorithm to reduce the mRNA and methylation feature dimensions and extract cluster eigengenes respectively. Then, we add an auxiliary ordinal loss to the original Cox model to improve the ability to optimize the learning process in training and regularization. The auxiliary loss helps to reduce the vanishing gradient problem for earlier layers and helps to decrease the loss of the primary task. Meanwhile, we use an adaptive weights approach to multi-task learning which weighs multiple loss functions by considering the homoscedastic uncertainty of each task. Finally, we build an ordinal cox hazards model for survival analysis and use long short-term memory (LSTM) method to predict patients' survival risk. We use the cross-validation method and the concordance index (C-index) for assessing the prediction effect. Stringent cross-verification testing processes for the benchmark dataset and two additional datasets demonstrate that the developed approach is effective, achieving very competitive performance with existing approaches. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: https://github.com/bhioswego/ML_ordCOX.
32990747	2020	Nucleic acids research	Hybridization-based in situ sequencing (HybISS) for spatially resolved transcriptomics in human and mouse brain tissue.	Visualization of the transcriptome in situ has proven to be a valuable tool in exploring single-cell RNA-sequencing data, providing an additional spatial dimension to investigate multiplexed gene expression, cell types, disease architecture or even data driven discoveries. In situ sequencing (ISS) method based on padlock probes and rolling circle amplification has been used to spatially resolve gene transcripts in tissue sections of various origins. Here, we describe the next iteration of ISS, HybISS, hybridization-based in situ sequencing. Modifications in probe design allows for a new barcoding system via sequence-by-hybridization chemistry for improved spatial detection of RNA transcripts. Due to the amplification of probes, amplicons can be visualized with standard epifluorescence microscopes for high-throughput efficiency and the new sequencing chemistry removes limitations bound by sequence-by-ligation chemistry of ISS. HybISS design allows for increased flexibility and multiplexing, increased signal-to-noise, all without compromising throughput efficiency of imaging large fields of view. Moreover, the current protocol is demonstrated to work on human brain tissue samples, a source that has proven to be difficult to work with image-based spatial analysis techniques. Overall, HybISS technology works as a targeted amplification detection method for improved spatial transcriptomic visualization, and importantly, with an ease of implementation.
36067230	2022	PLoS computational biology	Multi-omics subtyping of hepatocellular carcinoma patients using a Bayesian network mixture model.	Comprehensive molecular characterization of cancer subtypes is essential for predicting clinical outcomes and searching for personalized treatments. We present bnClustOmics, a statistical model and computational tool for multi-omics unsupervised clustering, which serves a dual purpose: Clustering patient samples based on a Bayesian network mixture model and learning the networks of omics variables representing these clusters. The discovered networks encode interactions among all omics variables and provide a molecular characterization of each patient subgroup. We conducted simulation studies that demonstrated the advantages of our approach compared to other clustering methods in the case where the generative model is a mixture of Bayesian networks. We applied bnClustOmics to a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) dataset comprising genome (mutation and copy number), transcriptome, proteome, and phosphoproteome data. We identified three main HCC subtypes together with molecular characteristics, some of which are associated with survival even when adjusting for the clinical stage. Cluster-specific networks shed light on the links between genotypes and molecular phenotypes of samples within their respective clusters and suggest targets for personalized treatments.
40682076	2025	Genome biology	STHD: probabilistic cell typing of single spots in whole transcriptome spatial data with high definition.	Recent advances in spatial transcriptomics technologies have enabled gene expression profiling across the transcriptome in spots with subcellular resolution, but high sparsity and dimensionality present significant computational challenges. We present STHD for probabilistic cell typing of single spots in whole-transcriptome spatial transcriptomics with high definition. With a machine learning model combining count statistics with neighbor regularization, STHD accurately predicts cell type identities of subcellular spots, revealing both global tissue architecture and local multicellular neighborhoods. We demonstrate STHD in spatial analyses of cell type-specific gene expression and immune interaction hubs in tumor microenvironment, and its generalizability across samples, tissues, and diseases.
38191932	2024	Nature methods	A fast, scalable and versatile tool for analysis of single-cell omics data.	Single-cell omics technologies have revolutionized the study of gene regulation in complex tissues. A major computational challenge in analyzing these datasets is to project the large-scale and high-dimensional data into low-dimensional space while retaining the relative relationships between cells. This low dimension embedding is necessary to decompose cellular heterogeneity and reconstruct cell-type-specific gene regulatory programs. Traditional dimensionality reduction techniques, however, face challenges in computational efficiency and in comprehensively addressing cellular diversity across varied molecular modalities. Here we introduce a nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithm, embodied in the Python package SnapATAC2, which not only achieves a more precise capture of single-cell omics data heterogeneities but also ensures efficient runtime and memory usage, scaling linearly with the number of cells. Our algorithm demonstrates exceptional performance, scalability and versatility across diverse single-cell omics datasets, including single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing, single-cell RNA sequencing, single-cell Hi-C and single-cell multi-omics datasets, underscoring its utility in advancing single-cell analysis.
37267161	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Optimization-based decoding of Imaging Spatial Transcriptomics data.	MOTIVATION: Imaging Spatial Transcriptomics techniques characterize gene expression in cells in their native context by imaging barcoded probes for mRNA with single molecule resolution. However, the need to acquire many rounds of high-magnification imaging data limits the throughput and impact of existing methods. RESULTS: We describe the Joint Sparse method for Imaging Transcriptomics, an algorithm for decoding lower magnification Imaging Spatial Transcriptomics data than that used in standard experimental workflows. Joint Sparse method for Imaging Transcriptomics incorporates codebook knowledge and sparsity assumptions into an optimization problem, which is less reliant on well separated optical signals than current pipelines. Using experimental data obtained by performing Multiplexed Error-Robust Fluorescence in situ Hybridization on tissue from mouse brain, we demonstrate that Joint Sparse method for Imaging Transcriptomics enables improved throughput and recovery performance over standard decoding methods. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Software implementation of JSIT, together with example files, is available at https://github.com/jpbryan13/JSIT.
36587187	2023	Nature methods	Nonnegative spatial factorization applied to spatial genomics.	Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is widely used to analyze high-dimensional count data because, in contrast to real-valued alternatives such as factor analysis, it produces an interpretable parts-based representation. However, in applications such as spatial transcriptomics, NMF fails to incorporate known structure between observations. Here, we present nonnegative spatial factorization (NSF), a spatially-aware probabilistic dimension reduction model based on transformed Gaussian processes that naturally encourages sparsity and scales to tens of thousands of observations. NSF recovers ground truth factors more accurately than real-valued alternatives such as MEFISTO in simulations, and has lower out-of-sample prediction error than probabilistic NMF on three spatial transcriptomics datasets from mouse brain and liver. Since not all patterns of gene expression have spatial correlations, we also propose a hybrid extension of NSF that combines spatial and nonspatial components, enabling quantification of spatial importance for both observations and features. A TensorFlow implementation of NSF is available from https://github.com/willtownes/nsf-paper .
36063454	2022	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	CCPLS reveals cell-type-specific spatial dependence of transcriptomes in single cells.	MOTIVATION: Cell-cell communications regulate internal cellular states, e.g. gene expression and cell functions, and play pivotal roles in normal development and disease states. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing methods have revealed cell-to-cell expression variability of highly variable genes (HVGs), which is also crucial. Nevertheless, the regulation of cell-to-cell expression variability of HVGs via cell-cell communications is still largely unexplored. The recent advent of spatial transcriptome methods has linked gene expression profiles to the spatial context of single cells, which has provided opportunities to reveal those regulations. The existing computational methods extract genes with expression levels influenced by neighboring cell types. However, limitations remain in the quantitativeness and interpretability: they neither focus on HVGs nor consider the effects of multiple neighboring cell types. RESULTS: Here, we propose CCPLS (Cell-Cell communications analysis by Partial Least Square regression modeling), which is a statistical framework for identifying cell-cell communications as the effects of multiple neighboring cell types on cell-to-cell expression variability of HVGs, based on the spatial transcriptome data. For each cell type, CCPLS performs PLS regression modeling and reports coefficients as the quantitative index of the cell-cell communications. Evaluation using simulated data showed our method accurately estimated the effects of multiple neighboring cell types on HVGs. Furthermore, applications to the two real datasets demonstrate that CCPLS can extract biologically interpretable insights from the inferred cell-cell communications. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The R package is available at https://github.com/bioinfo-tsukuba/CCPLS. The data are available at https://github.com/bioinfo-tsukuba/CCPLS_paper. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
37232385	2023	Briefings in bioinformatics	Integrating massive RNA-seq data to elucidate transcriptome dynamics in Drosophila melanogaster.	The volume of ribonucleic acid (RNA)-seq data has increased exponentially, providing numerous new insights into various biological processes. However, due to significant practical challenges, such as data heterogeneity, it is still difficult to ensure the quality of these data when integrated. Although some quality control methods have been developed, sample consistency is rarely considered and these methods are susceptible to artificial factors. Here, we developed MassiveQC, an unsupervised machine learning-based approach, to automatically download and filter large-scale high-throughput data. In addition to the read quality used in other tools, MassiveQC also uses the alignment and expression quality as model features. Meanwhile, it is user-friendly since the cutoff is generated from self-reporting and is applicable to multimodal data. To explore its value, we applied MassiveQC to Drosophila RNA-seq data and generated a comprehensive transcriptome atlas across 28 tissues from embryogenesis to adulthood. We systematically characterized fly gene expression dynamics and found that genes with high expression dynamics were likely to be evolutionarily young and expressed at late developmental stages, exhibiting high nonsynonymous substitution rates and low phenotypic severity, and they were involved in simple regulatory programs. We also discovered that human and Drosophila had strong positive correlations in gene expression in orthologous organs, revealing the great potential of the Drosophila system for studying human development and disease.
38741206	2024	Genome biology	EmptyDropsMultiome discriminates real cells from background in single-cell multiomics assays.	Multiomic droplet-based technologies allow different molecular modalities, such as chromatin accessibility and gene expression (scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq), to be probed in the same nucleus. We develop EmptyDropsMultiome, an approach that distinguishes true nuclei-containing droplets from background. Using simulations, we show that EmptyDropsMultiome has higher statistical power and accuracy than existing approaches, including CellRanger-arc and EmptyDrops. On real datasets, we observe that CellRanger-arc misses more than half of the nuclei identified by EmptyDropsMultiome and, moreover, is biased against certain cell types, some of which have a retrieval rate lower than 20%.
39266749	2024	Nature methods	FICTURE: scalable segmentation-free analysis of submicron-resolution spatial transcriptomics.	Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies have advanced to enable transcriptome-wide gene expression analysis at submicron resolution over large areas. However, analysis of high-resolution ST is often challenged by complex tissue structure, where existing cell segmentation methods struggle due to the irregular cell sizes and shapes, and by the absence of segmentation-free methods scalable to whole-transcriptome analysis. Here we present FICTURE (Factor Inference of Cartographic Transcriptome at Ultra-high REsolution), a segmentation-free spatial factorization method that can handle transcriptome-wide data labeled with billions of submicron-resolution spatial coordinates and is compatible with both sequencing-based and imaging-based ST data. FICTURE uses the multilayered Dirichlet model for stochastic variational inference of pixel-level spatial factors, and is orders of magnitude more efficient than existing methods. FICTURE reveals the microscopic ST architecture for challenging tissues, such as vascular, fibrotic, muscular and lipid-laden areas in real data where previous methods failed. FICTURE's cross-platform generality, scalability and precision make it a powerful tool for exploring high-resolution ST.
41261740	2025	Nucleic acids research	The mouse Gene Expression Database (GXD): 2026 update.	The Gene Expression Database (GXD; https://www.informatics.jax.org/expression.shtml) is an extensive, well-curated community resource that provides detailed information about gene expression patterns in mouse strains and mutants, with a particular emphasis on development. For over 25 years, GXD has systematically curated the scientific literature and collaborated with large-scale expression projects to compile and integrate detailed expression data from multiple assay types, including RNA in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, in situ reporter (knock-in), RT-PCR, northern blot, and western blot experiments. In recent years, GXD has expanded its scope to include bulk RNA-Seq data, imported from the EMBL-EBI Expression Atlas. Since our last report in 2021, we continued to add data to GXD on a daily basis, and we implemented new search and display features. These include: (i) searches for qualitative differential gene expression and expression profiles that include both classical types of expression data and RNA-Seq data; (ii) browsing, searching, and filtering for cell-type-specific gene expression information; and (iii) an enhancement of our RNA-Seq and microarray experiment metadata index and search to allow users to quickly and reliably find bulk, single-cell, or spatial RNA-Seq data in the public repositories.
39715685	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	STCGAN: a novel cycle-consistent generative adversarial network for spatial transcriptomics cellular deconvolution.	MOTIVATION: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies have revolutionized our ability to map gene expression patterns within native tissue context, providing unprecedented insights into tissue architecture and cellular heterogeneity. However, accurately deconvolving cell-type compositions from ST spots remains challenging due to the sparse and averaged nature of ST data, which is essential for accurately depicting tissue architecture. While numerous computational methods have been developed for cell-type deconvolution and spatial distribution reconstruction, most fail to capture tissue complexity at the single-cell level, thereby limiting their applicability in practical scenarios. RESULTS: To this end, we propose a novel cycle-consistent generative adversarial network named STCGAN for cellular deconvolution in spatial transcriptomic. STCGAN first employs a cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CGAN) to pre-train on ST data, ensuring that both the mapping from ST data to latent space and its reverse mapping are consistent, capturing complex spatial gene expression patterns and learning robust latent representations. Based on the learned representation, STCGAN then optimizes a trainable cell-to-spot mapping matrix to integrate scRNA-seq data with ST data, accurately estimating cellular composition within each capture spot and effectively reconstructing the spatial distribution of cells across the tissue. To further enhance deconvolution accuracy, we incorporate spatial-aware regularization that ensures accurate cellular distribution reconstruction within the spatial context. Benchmarking against seven state-of-the-art methods on five simulated and real datasets from various tissues, STCGAN consistently delivers superior cell-type deconvolution performance. AVAILABILITY: The code of STCGAN can be downloaded from https://github.com/cs-wangbo/STCGAN and all the mentioned datasets are available on Zenodo at https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10799113.
35048973	2022	Nucleic acids research	Variational autoencoding of gene landscapes during mouse CNS development uncovers layered roles of Polycomb Repressor Complex 2.	A prominent aspect of most, if not all, central nervous systems (CNSs) is that anterior regions (brain) are larger than posterior ones (spinal cord). Studies in Drosophila and mouse have revealed that Polycomb Repressor Complex 2 (PRC2), a protein complex responsible for applying key repressive histone modifications, acts by several mechanisms to promote anterior CNS expansion. However, it is unclear what the full spectrum of PRC2 action is during embryonic CNS development and how PRC2 intersects with the epigenetic landscape. We removed PRC2 function from the developing mouse CNS, by mutating the key gene Eed, and generated spatio-temporal transcriptomic data. To decode the role of PRC2, we developed a method that incorporates standard statistical analyses with probabilistic deep learning to integrate the transcriptomic response to PRC2 inactivation with epigenetic data. This multi-variate analysis corroborates the central involvement of PRC2 in anterior CNS expansion, and also identifies several unanticipated cohorts of genes, such as proliferation and immune response genes. Furthermore, the analysis reveals specific profiles of regulation via PRC2 upon these gene cohorts. These findings uncover a differential logic for the role of PRC2 upon functionally distinct gene cohorts that drive CNS anterior expansion. To support the analysis of emerging multi-modal datasets, we provide a novel bioinformatics package that integrates transcriptomic and epigenetic datasets to identify regulatory underpinnings of heterogeneous biological processes.
39924717	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Deconvolution of spatial transcriptomics data via graph contrastive learning and partial least square regression.	Deciphering the cellular abundance in spatial transcriptomics (ST) is crucial for revealing the spatial architecture of cellular heterogeneity within tissues. However, some of the current spatial sequencing technologies are in low resolutions, leading to each spot having multiple heterogeneous cells. Additionally, current spatial deconvolution methods lack the ability to utilize multi-modality information such as gene expression and chromatin accessibility from single-cell multi-omics data. In this study, we introduce a graph Contrastive Learning and Partial Least Squares regression-based method, CLPLS, to deconvolute ST data. CLPLS is a flexible method that it can be extended to integrate ST data and single-cell multi-omics data, enabling the exploration of the spatially epigenomic heterogeneity. We applied CLPLS to both simulated and real datasets coming from different platforms. Benchmark analyses with other methods on these datasets show the superior performance of CLPLS in deconvoluting spots in single cell level.
34083791	2021	Nature biotechnology	Spatial transcriptomics at subspot resolution with BayesSpace.	Recent spatial gene expression technologies enable comprehensive measurement of transcriptomic profiles while retaining spatial context. However, existing analysis methods do not address the limited resolution of the technology or use the spatial information efficiently. Here, we introduce BayesSpace, a fully Bayesian statistical method that uses the information from spatial neighborhoods for resolution enhancement of spatial transcriptomic data and for clustering analysis. We benchmark BayesSpace against current methods for spatial and non-spatial clustering and show that it improves identification of distinct intra-tissue transcriptional profiles from samples of the brain, melanoma, invasive ductal carcinoma and ovarian adenocarcinoma. Using immunohistochemistry and an in silico dataset constructed from scRNA-seq data, we show that BayesSpace resolves tissue structure that is not detectable at the original resolution and identifies transcriptional heterogeneity inaccessible to histological analysis. Our results illustrate BayesSpace's utility in facilitating the discovery of biological insights from spatial transcriptomic datasets.
40210438	2025	Genome research	TFcomb identifies transcription factor combinations for cellular reprogramming based on single-cell multiomics data.	Reprogramming cell state transitions provides the potential for cell engineering and regenerative therapy. Finding the reprogramming transcription factors (TFs) and their combinations that can direct the desired state transition is crucial for the task. Computational methods have been developed to identify such reprogramming TFs. However, most of them can only generate a ranked list of individual TFs and ignore the identification of TF combinations. Even for individual reprogramming TF identification, current methods often fail to put the real effective reprogramming TFs at the top. To address these challenges, we developed TFcomb, a computational method that leverages single-cell multiomics data to identify reprogramming TFs and TF combinations. We modeled the task of finding reprogramming TFs and their combinations as an inverse problem, and used Tikhonov regularization to guarantee the generalization ability of solutions. For the coefficient matrix of the model, we designed a graph attention network to augment gene regulatory networks built with single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data. Benchmarking experiments on data of human embryonic stem cells demonstrate superior performance of TFcomb against existing methods for identifying individual TFs. We curate data sets of multiple cell reprogramming cases and demonstrate that TFcomb can efficiently identify reprogramming TF combinations from vast potential combinations. We apply TFcomb on a data set of mouse hair follicle development and find key TFs in cell differentiation. All experiments show that TFcomb is powerful in identifying reprogramming TFs and TF combinations from single-cell data sets to empower future cell engineering.
31932730	2020	Nature biotechnology	Integrating microarray-based spatial transcriptomics and single-cell RNA-seq reveals tissue architecture in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables the systematic identification of cell populations in a tissue, but characterizing their spatial organization remains challenging. We combine a microarray-based spatial transcriptomics method that reveals spatial patterns of gene expression using an array of spots, each capturing the transcriptomes of multiple adjacent cells, with scRNA-Seq generated from the same sample. To annotate the precise cellular composition of distinct tissue regions, we introduce a method for multimodal intersection analysis. Applying multimodal intersection analysis to primary pancreatic tumors, we find that subpopulations of ductal cells, macrophages, dendritic cells and cancer cells have spatially restricted enrichments, as well as distinct coenrichments with other cell types. Furthermore, we identify colocalization of inflammatory fibroblasts and cancer cells expressing a stress-response gene module. Our approach for mapping the architecture of scRNA-seq-defined subpopulations can be applied to reveal the interactions inherent to complex tissues.
41261731	2025	Nucleic acids research	NONCODE v7.0: updated lncRNA resource integrating scRNA-seq data encompassing immune baseline, development, and disease.	The rapid advancement of single-cell multi-omics technologies, typified by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), has provided systematic methodologies for dissecting gene expression heterogeneity within cell populations. However, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) research is hindered by a lack of databases covering diverse tissues, disease contexts, and integrated multi-dimensional single-cell annotations. To address this gap, we updated NONCODE v7.0 (available at https://v7.noncode.org/) through the integration of scRNA-seq data, enabling systematic analysis of lncRNA expression. NONCODE v7.0 incorporates 2061 human scRNA-seq samples from 229 datasets, covering a spectrum of 6 categories, with 3 core ones including Physiological Control as an immune baseline, Physiological Development, and Pathological Disease. Following standardized quality control and processing, the database encompasses 14 million high-quality cells and annotates 94 843 lncRNAs (98.5% of human lncRNAs in NONCODE v6.0). Furthermore, we extended the database through the integration of single-cell-tailored functional modules, encompassing data query and retrieval, interactive visualization (including cell composition, UMAP/t-SNE clustering, marker gene heatmaps, and lncRNA expression profiles), and comparative analysis functionalities. The analytical module facilitates the identification of cell-type-specific differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs across distinct disease states, thus establishing a foundational resource platform to facilitate the advancement of downstream functional investigations into lncRNAs.
40179332	2025	PLoS computational biology	SpaMask: Dual masking graph autoencoder with contrastive learning for spatial transcriptomics.	Understanding the spatial locations of cell within tissues is crucial for unraveling the organization of cellular diversity. Recent advancements in spatial resolved transcriptomics (SRT) have enabled the analysis of gene expression while preserving the spatial context within tissues. Spatial domain characterization is a critical first step in SRT data analysis, providing the foundation for subsequent analyses and insights into biological implications. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a common tool for addressing this challenge due to the structural nature of SRT data. However, current graph-based deep learning approaches often overlook the instability caused by the high sparsity of SRT data. Masking mechanisms, as an effective self-supervised learning strategy, can enhance the robustness of these models. To this end, we propose SpaMask, dual masking graph autoencoder with contrastive learning for SRT analysis. Unlike previous GNNs, SpaMask masks a portion of spot nodes and spot-to-spot edges to enhance its performance and robustness. SpaMask combines Masked Graph Autoencoders (MGAE) and Masked Graph Contrastive Learning (MGCL) modules, with MGAE using node masking to leverage spatial neighbors for improved clustering accuracy, while MGCL applies edge masking to create a contrastive loss framework that tightens embeddings of adjacent nodes based on spatial proximity and feature similarity. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of SpaMask on eight datasets from five different platforms. Compared to existing methods, SpaMask achieves superior clustering accuracy and effective batch correction.
37365616	2023	Genome biology	Transcriptome- and proteome-wide association studies nominate determinants of kidney function and damage.	BACKGROUND: The pathophysiological causes of kidney disease are not fully understood. Here we show that the integration of genome-wide genetic, transcriptomic, and proteomic association studies can nominate causal determinants of kidney function and damage. RESULTS: Through transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) in kidney cortex, kidney tubule, liver, and whole blood and proteome-wide association studies (PWAS) in plasma, we assess for effects of 12,893 genes and 1342 proteins on kidney filtration (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimated by creatinine; GFR estimated by cystatin C; and blood urea nitrogen) and kidney damage (albuminuria). We find 1561 associations distributed among 260 genomic regions that are supported as putatively causal. We then prioritize 153 of these genomic regions using additional colocalization analyses. Our genome-wide findings are supported by existing knowledge (animal models for MANBA, DACH1, SH3YL1, INHBB), exceed the underlying GWAS signals (28 region-trait combinations without significant GWAS hit), identify independent gene/protein-trait associations within the same genomic region (INHBC, SPRYD4), nominate tissues underlying the associations (tubule expression of NRBP1), and distinguish markers of kidney filtration from those with a role in creatinine and cystatin C metabolism. Furthermore, we follow up on members of the TGF-beta superfamily of proteins and find a prognostic value of INHBC for kidney disease progression even after adjustment for measured glomerular filtration rate (GFR). CONCLUSION: In summary, this study combines multimodal, genome-wide association studies to generate a catalog of putatively causal target genes and proteins relevant to kidney function and damage which can guide follow-up studies in physiology, basic science, and clinical medicine.
39849132	2025	Nature methods	Mapping the topography of spatial gene expression with interpretable deep learning.	Spatially resolved transcriptomics technologies provide high-throughput measurements of gene expression in a tissue slice, but the sparsity of these data complicates analysis of spatial gene expression patterns. We address this issue by deriving a topographic map of a tissue slice-analogous to a map of elevation in a landscape-using a quantity called the isodepth. Contours of constant isodepths enclose domains with distinct cell type composition, while gradients of the isodepth indicate spatial directions of maximum change in expression. We develop GASTON (gradient analysis of spatial transcriptomics organization with neural networks), an unsupervised and interpretable deep learning algorithm that simultaneously learns the isodepth, spatial gradients and piecewise linear expression functions that model both continuous gradients and discontinuous variation in gene expression. We show that GASTON accurately identifies spatial domains and marker genes across several tissues, gradients of neuronal differentiation and firing in the brain, and gradients of metabolism and immune activity in the tumor microenvironment.
34213536	2021	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Non-parametric modelling of temporal and spatial counts data from RNA-seq experiments.	MOTIVATION: The negative binomial distribution has been shown to be a good model for counts data from both bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). Gaussian process (GP) regression provides a useful non-parametric approach for modelling temporal or spatial changes in gene expression. However, currently available GP regression methods that implement negative binomial likelihood models do not scale to the increasingly large datasets being produced by single-cell and spatial transcriptomics. RESULTS: The GPcounts package implements GP regression methods for modelling counts data using a negative binomial likelihood function. Computational efficiency is achieved through the use of variational Bayesian inference. The GP function models changes in the mean of the negative binomial likelihood through a logarithmic link function and the dispersion parameter is fitted by maximum likelihood. We validate the method on simulated time course data, showing better performance to identify changes in over-dispersed counts data than methods based on Gaussian or Poisson likelihoods. To demonstrate temporal inference, we apply GPcounts to single-cell RNA-seq datasets after pseudotime and branching inference. To demonstrate spatial inference, we apply GPcounts to data from the mouse olfactory bulb to identify spatially variable genes and compare to two published GP methods. We also provide the option of modelling additional dropout using a zero-inflated negative binomial. Our results show that GPcounts can be used to model temporal and spatial counts data in cases where simpler Gaussian and Poisson likelihoods are unrealistic. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: GPcounts is implemented using the GPflow library in Python and is available at https://github.com/ManchesterBioinference/GPcounts along with the data, code and notebooks required to reproduce the results presented here. The version used for this paper is archived at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5027066. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
40037709	2025	Nucleic acids research	Deep learning-based cell-specific gene regulatory networks inferred from single-cell multiome data.	Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) provide a global representation of how genetic/genomic information is transferred in living systems and are a key component in understanding genome regulation. Single-cell multiome data provide unprecedented opportunities to reconstruct GRNs at fine-grained resolution. However, the inference of GRNs is hindered by insufficient single omic profiles due to the characteristic high loss rate of single-cell sequencing data. In this study, we developed scMultiomeGRN, a deep learning framework to infer transcription factor (TF) regulatory networks via unique integration of single-cell genomic (single-cell RNA sequencing) and epigenomic (single-cell ATAC sequencing) data. We create scMultiomeGRN to elucidate these networks by conceptualizing TF network graph structures. Specifically, we build modality-specific neighbor aggregators and cross-modal attention modules to learn latent representations of TFs from single-cell multi-omics. We demonstrate that scMultiomeGRN outperforms state-of-the-art models on multiple benchmark datasets involved in diseases and health. Via scMultiomeGRN, we identified Alzheimer's disease-relevant regulatory network of SPI1 and RUNX1 for microglia. In summary, scMultiomeGRN offers a deep learning framework to identify cell type-specific gene regulatory network from single-cell multiome data.
35380614	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	SPCS: a spatial and pattern combined smoothing method for spatial transcriptomic expression.	High-dimensional, localized ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing is now possible owing to recent developments in spatial transcriptomics (ST). ST is based on highly multiplexed sequence analysis and uses barcodes to match the sequenced reads to their respective tissue locations. ST expression data suffer from high noise and dropout events; however, smoothing techniques have the promise to improve the data interpretability prior to performing downstream analyses. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data similarly suffer from these limitations, and smoothing methods developed for scRNA-seq can only utilize associations in transcriptome space (also known as one-factor smoothing methods). Since they do not account for spatial relationships, these one-factor smoothing methods cannot take full advantage of ST data. In this study, we present a novel two-factor smoothing technique, spatial and pattern combined smoothing (SPCS), that employs the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) technique to utilize information from transcriptome and spatial relationships. By performing SPCS on multiple ST slides from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and simulated high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) datasets, smoothed ST slides have better separability, partition accuracy and biological interpretability than the ones smoothed by preexisting one-factor methods. Source code of SPCS is provided in Github (https://github.com/Usos/SPCS).
40658464	2025	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	cytoKernel: robust kernel embeddings for assessing differential expression of single-cell data.	MOTIVATION: High-throughput sequencing of single-cell data can be used to rigorously evaluate cell specification and enable intricate variations between groups or conditions to be identified. Many popular existing methods for differential expression target differences in aggregate measurement (mean, median, sum) and limit their approaches to detect only global differential changes. RESULTS: We present a robust method for differential expression of single-cell data using a kernel-based score test, cytoKernel. CytoKernel is specifically designed to assess the differential expression of single-cell RNA sequencing and high-dimensional flow or mass cytometry data using the full probability distribution pattern. cytoKernel is based on kernel embeddings which employs the probability distributions of the single-cell data, by calculating the pairwise divergence/distance between distributions of subjects. It can detect both patterns involving changes in the aggregate, as well as more elusive variations that are often overlooked due to the multimodal characteristics of single-cell data. We performed extensive benchmarks across both simulated and real data sets from mass cytometry data and single-cell RNA sequencing. The cytoKernel procedure effectively controls the false discovery rate and shows favorable performance compared to existing methods. The method is able to identify more differential patterns than existing approaches. We apply cytoKernel to assess gene expression and protein marker expression differences from cell subpopulations in various publicly available single-cell RNAseq and mass cytometry datasets. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The methods described in this paper are implemented in the open-source R package cytoKernel, which is freely available from Bioconductor at http://bioconductor.org/packages/cytoKernel.
37439331	2023	Nucleic acids research	iSMOD: an integrative browser for image-based single-cell multi-omics data.	Genomic and transcriptomic image data, represented by DNA and RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), respectively, together with proteomic data, particularly that related to nuclear proteins, can help elucidate gene regulation in relation to the spatial positions of chromatins, messenger RNAs, and key proteins. However, methods for image-based multi-omics data collection and analysis are lacking. To this end, we aimed to develop the first integrative browser called iSMOD (image-based Single-cell Multi-omics Database) to collect and browse comprehensive FISH and nucleus proteomics data based on the title, abstract, and related experimental figures, which integrates multi-omics studies focusing on the key players in the cell nucleus from 20 000+ (still growing) published papers. We have also provided several exemplar demonstrations to show iSMOD's wide applications-profiling multi-omics research to reveal the molecular target for diseases; exploring the working mechanism behind biological phenomena using multi-omics interactions, and integrating the 3D multi-omics data in a virtual cell nucleus. iSMOD is a cornerstone for delineating a global view of relevant research to enable the integration of scattered data and thus provides new insights regarding the missing components of molecular pathway mechanisms and facilitates improved and efficient scientific research.
35314812	2022	Nature biotechnology	Spatial charting of single-cell transcriptomes in tissues.	Single-cell RNA sequencing methods can profile the transcriptomes of single cells but cannot preserve spatial information. Conversely, spatial transcriptomics assays can profile spatial regions in tissue sections, but do not have single-cell resolution. Here, we developed a computational method called CellTrek that combines these two datasets to achieve single-cell spatial mapping through coembedding and metric learning approaches. We benchmarked CellTrek using simulation and in situ hybridization datasets, which demonstrated its accuracy and robustness. We then applied CellTrek to existing mouse brain and kidney datasets and showed that CellTrek can detect topological patterns of different cell types and cell states. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics experiments on two ductal carcinoma in situ tissues and applied CellTrek to identify tumor subclones that were restricted to different ducts, and specific T cell states adjacent to the tumor areas. Our data show that CellTrek can accurately map single cells in diverse tissue types to resolve their spatial organization.
39883515	2024	Briefings in bioinformatics	Graph contrastive learning of subcellular-resolution spatial transcriptomics improves cell type annotation and reveals critical molecular pathways.	Imaging-based spatial transcriptomics (iST), such as MERFISH, CosMx SMI, and Xenium, quantify gene expression level across cells in space, but more importantly, they directly reveal the subcellular distribution of RNA transcripts at the single-molecule resolution. The subcellular localization of RNA molecules plays a crucial role in the compartmentalization-dependent regulation of genes within individual cells. Understanding the intracellular spatial distribution of RNA for a particular cell type thus not only improves the characterization of cell identity but also is of paramount importance in elucidating unique subcellular regulatory mechanisms specific to the cell type. However, current cell type annotation approaches of iST primarily utilize gene expression information while neglecting the spatial distribution of RNAs within cells. In this work, we introduce a semi-supervised graph contrastive learning method called Focus, the first method, to the best of our knowledge, that explicitly models RNA's subcellular distribution and community to improve cell type annotation. Focus demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art algorithms across a range of spatial transcriptomics platforms, achieving improvements up to 27.8% in terms of accuracy and 51.9% in terms of F1-score for cell type annotation. Furthermore, Focus enjoys the advantages of intricate cell type-specific subcellular spatial gene patterns and providing interpretable subcellular gene analysis, such as defining the gene importance score. Importantly, with the importance score, Focus identifies genes harboring strong relevance to cell type-specific pathways, indicating its potential in uncovering novel regulatory programs across numerous biological systems.
32436932	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	miRactDB characterizes miRNA-gene relation switch between normal and cancer tissues across pan-cancer.	It has been increasingly accepted that microRNA (miRNA) can both activate and suppress gene expression, directly or indirectly, under particular circumstances. Yet, a systematic study on the switch in their interaction pattern between activation and suppression and between normal and cancer conditions based on multi-omics evidences is not available. We built miRactDB, a database for miRNA-gene interaction, at https://ccsm.uth.edu/miRactDB, to provide a versatile resource and platform for annotation and interpretation of miRNA-gene relations. We conducted a comprehensive investigation on miRNA-gene interactions and their biological implications across tissue types in both tumour and normal conditions, based on TCGA, CCLE and GTEx databases. We particularly explored the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms potentially contributing to the positive correlation, including identification of miRNA binding sites in the gene coding sequence (CDS) and promoter regions of partner genes. Integrative analysis based on this resource revealed that top-ranked genes derived from TCGA tumour and adjacent normal samples share an overwhelming part of biological processes, which are quite different than those from CCLE and GTEx. The most active miRNAs predicted to target CDS and promoter regions are largely overlapped. These findings corroborate that adjacent normal tissues might have undergone significant molecular transformations towards oncogenesis before phenotypic and histological change; and there probably exists a small yet critical set of miRNAs that profoundly influence various cancer hallmark processes. miRactDB provides a unique resource for the cancer and genomics communities to screen, prioritize and rationalize their candidates of miRNA-gene interactions, in both normal and cancer scenarios.
32632238	2020	Nature methods	ZipSeq: barcoding for real-time mapping of single cell transcriptomes.	Spatial transcriptomics seeks to integrate single cell transcriptomic data within the three-dimensional space of multicellular biology. Current methods to correlate a cell's position with its transcriptome in living tissues have various limitations. We developed an approach, called 'ZipSeq', that uses patterned illumination and photocaged oligonucleotides to serially print barcodes ('zipcodes') onto live cells in intact tissues, in real time and with an on-the-fly selection of patterns. Using ZipSeq, we mapped gene expression in three settings: in vitro wound healing, live lymph node sections and a live tumor microenvironment. In all cases, we discovered new gene expression patterns associated with histological structures. In the tumor microenvironment, this demonstrated a trajectory of myeloid and T cell differentiation from the periphery inward. A combinatorial variation of ZipSeq efficiently scales in the number of regions defined, providing a pathway for complete mapping of live tissues, subsequent to real-time imaging or perturbation.
33200787	2021	Briefings in bioinformatics	Deep-joint-learning analysis model of single cell transcriptome and open chromatin accessibility data.	Simultaneous profiling transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility information in the same individual cells offers an unprecedented resolution to understand cell states. However, computationally effective methods for the integration of these inherent sparse and heterogeneous data are lacking. Here, we present a single-cell multimodal variational autoencoder model, which combines three types of joint-learning strategies with a probabilistic Gaussian Mixture Model to learn the joint latent features that accurately represent these multilayer profiles. Studies on both simulated datasets and real datasets demonstrate that it has more preferable capability (i) dissecting cellular heterogeneity in the joint-learning space, (ii) denoising and imputing data and (iii) constructing the association between multilayer omics data, which can be used for understanding transcriptional regulatory mechanisms.
36252928	2022	Briefings in bioinformatics	A comprehensive survey of the approaches for pathway analysis using multi-omics data integration.	Pathway analysis has been widely used to detect pathways and functions associated with complex disease phenotypes. The proliferation of this approach is due to better interpretability of its results and its higher statistical power compared with the gene-level statistics. A plethora of pathway analysis methods that utilize multi-omics setup, rather than just transcriptomics or proteomics, have recently been developed to discover novel pathways and biomarkers. Since multi-omics gives multiple views into the same problem, different approaches are employed in aggregating these views into a comprehensive biological context. As a result, a variety of novel hypotheses regarding disease ideation and treatment targets can be formulated. In this article, we review 32 such pathway analysis methods developed for multi-omics and multi-cohort data. We discuss their availability and implementation, assumptions, supported omics types and databases, pathway analysis techniques and integration strategies. A comprehensive assessment of each method's practicality, and a thorough discussion of the strengths and drawbacks of each technique will be provided. The main objective of this survey is to provide a thorough examination of existing methods to assist potential users and researchers in selecting suitable tools for their data and analysis purposes, while highlighting outstanding challenges in the field that remain to be addressed for future development.
40442373	2025	Nature methods	A visual-omics foundation model to bridge histopathology with spatial transcriptomics.	Artificial intelligence has revolutionized computational biology. Recent developments in omics technologies, including single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, provide detailed genomic data alongside tissue histology. However, current computational models focus on either omics or image analysis, lacking their integration. To address this, we developed OmiCLIP, a visual-omics foundation model linking hematoxylin and eosin images and transcriptomics using tissue patches from Visium data. We transformed transcriptomic data into 'sentences' by concatenating top-expressed gene symbols from each patch. We curated a dataset of 2.2 million paired tissue images and transcriptomic data across 32 organs to train OmiCLIP integrating histology and transcriptomics. Building on OmiCLIP, our Loki platform offers five key functions: tissue alignment, annotation via bulk RNA sequencing or marker genes, cell-type decomposition, image-transcriptomics retrieval and spatial transcriptomics gene expression prediction from hematoxylin and eosin-stained images. Compared with 22 state-of-the-art models on 5 simulations, and 19 public and 4 in-house experimental datasets, Loki demonstrated consistent accuracy and robustness.
38808672	2024	Nucleic acids research	WebGestalt 2024: faster gene set analysis and new support for metabolomics and multi-omics.	Enrichment analysis, crucial for interpreting genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data, is expanding into metabolomics. Furthermore, there is a rising demand for integrated enrichment analysis that combines data from different studies and omics platforms, as seen in meta-analysis and multi-omics research. To address these growing needs, we have updated WebGestalt to include enrichment analysis capabilities for both metabolites and multiple input lists of analytes. We have also significantly increased analysis speed, revamped the user interface, and introduced new pathway visualizations to accommodate these updates. Notably, the adoption of a Rust backend reduced gene set enrichment analysis time by 95% from 270.64 to 12.41 s and network topology-based analysis by 89% from 159.59 to 17.31 s in our evaluation. This performance improvement is also accessible in both the R package and a newly introduced Python package. Additionally, we have updated the data in the WebGestalt database to reflect the current status of each source and have expanded our collection of pathways, networks, and gene signatures. The 2024 WebGestalt update represents a significant leap forward, offering new support for metabolomics, streamlined multi-omics analysis capabilities, and remarkable performance enhancements.

39494542	2025	Nucleic acids research	Pairpot: a database with real-time lasso-based analysis tailored for paired single-cell and spatial transcriptomics.	Paired single-cell and spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) data supplement each other, providing in-depth insights into biological processes and disease mechanisms. Previous SRT databases have limitations in curating sufficient single-cell and SRT pairs (SC-SP pairs) and providing real-time heuristic analysis, which hinder the effort to uncover potential biological insights. Here, we developed Pairpot (http://pairpot.bioxai.cn), a database tailored for paired single-cell and SRT data with real-time heuristic analysis. Pairpot curates 99 high-quality pairs including 1,425,656 spots from 299 datasets, and creates the association networks. It constructs the curated pairs by integrating multiple slices and establishing potential associations between single-cell and SRT data. On this basis, Pairpot adopts semi-supervised learning that enables real-time heuristic analysis for SC-SP pairs where Lasso-View refines the user-selected SRT domains within milliseconds, Pair-View infers cell proportions of spots based on user-selected cell types in real-time and Layer-View displays SRT slices using a 3D hierarchical layout. Experiments demonstrated Pairpot's efficiency in identifying heterogeneous domains and cell proportions.
40471991	2025	Briefings in bioinformatics	ScInfeR: an efficient method for annotating cell types and sub-types in single-cell RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and spatial omics.	Cell-type annotation remains a major challenge in single-cell and spatial omics analysis. Most existing methods rely on single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) references or predefined marker sets. However, the scarcity of high-quality scRNA-seq references and marker sets makes relying on a single approach prone to bias and limits usability. Furthermore, available methods for cell-type annotation in single-cell ATAC-sequencing (scATAC-seq) and spatial transcriptomics datasets perform poorly. Here, we present ScInfeR, a graph-based cell-type annotation method that combines information from both scRNA-seq references and marker sets. By integrating these two data sources, ScInfeR can accurately annotate broad range of cell-types. It employs a hierarchical framework inspired by message-passing layers in graph neural networks to accurately identify cell subtypes. ScInfeR is highly versatile, supporting cell annotation across scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, and spatial omics datasets. For scATAC-seq, it effectively utilizes chromatin accessibility data, while for spatial transcriptomics, it incorporates spatial coordinate information. Additionally, ScInfeR supports weighted positive and negative markers, allowing users to define marker importance in cell-type classification. Our extensive benchmarking across multiple atlas-scale scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, and spatial datasets, evaluating 10 existing tools in over 100 cell-type prediction tasks, demonstrated ScInfeR's superior performance. Noteworthy, it exhibits robustness against batch effects arising in these datasets. To facilitate seamless annotation, we developed ScInfeRDB, an interactive database containing manually curated scRNA-seq references and marker sets for 329 cell-types, covering 2497 gene markers in 28 tissue types from human and plant. ScInfeR is available as an R package, with both the tool and database publicly accessible at https://www.swainasish.in/scinfer.
35536287	2022	Nucleic acids research	Cell type identification in spatial transcriptomics data can be improved by leveraging cell-type-informative paired tissue images using a Bayesian probabilistic model.	Spatial transcriptomics technologies have recently emerged as a powerful tool for measuring spatially resolved gene expression directly in tissues sections, revealing cell types and their dysfunction in unprecedented detail. However, spatial transcriptomics technologies are limited in their ability to separate transcriptionally similar cell types and can suffer further difficulties identifying cell types in slide regions where transcript capture is low. Here, we describe a conceptually novel methodology that can computationally integrate spatial transcriptomics data with cell-type-informative paired tissue images, obtained from, for example, the reverse side of the same tissue section, to improve inferences of tissue cell type composition in spatial transcriptomics data. The underlying statistical approach is generalizable to any spatial transcriptomics protocol where informative paired tissue images can be obtained. We demonstrate a use case leveraging cell-type-specific immunofluorescence markers obtained on mouse brain tissue sections and a use case for leveraging the output of AI annotated H&E tissue images, which we used to markedly improve the identification of clinically relevant immune cell infiltration in breast cancer tissue. Thus, combining spatial transcriptomics data with paired tissue images has the potential to improve the identification of cell types and hence to improve the applications of spatial transcriptomics that rely on accurate cell type identification.
37522887	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	FGCNSurv: dually fused graph convolutional network for multi-omics survival prediction.	MOTIVATION: Survival analysis is an important tool for modeling time-to-event data, e.g. to predict the survival time of patient after a cancer diagnosis or a certain treatment. While deep neural networks work well in standard prediction tasks, it is still unclear how to best utilize these deep models in survival analysis due to the difficulty of modeling right censored data, especially for multi-omics data. Although existing methods have shown the advantage of multi-omics integration in survival prediction, it remains challenging to extract complementary information from different omics and improve the prediction accuracy. RESULTS: In this work, we propose a novel multi-omics deep survival prediction approach by dually fused graph convolutional network (GCN) named FGCNSurv. Our FGCNSurv is a complete generative model from multi-omics data to survival outcome of patients, including feature fusion by a factorized bilinear model, graph fusion of multiple graphs, higher-level feature extraction by GCN and survival prediction by a Cox proportional hazard model. The factorized bilinear model enables to capture cross-omics features and quantify complex relations from multi-omics data. By fusing single-omics features and the cross-omics features, and simultaneously fusing multiple graphs from different omics, GCN with the generated dually fused graph could capture higher-level features for computing the survival loss in the Cox-PH model. Comprehensive experimental results on real-world datasets with gene expression and microRNA expression data show that the proposed FGCNSurv method outperforms existing survival prediction methods, and imply its ability to extract complementary information for survival prediction from multi-omics data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The codes are freely available at https://github.com/LiminLi-xjtu/FGCNSurv.
40551235	2025	Genome biology	spCLUE: a contrastive learning approach to unified spatial transcriptomics analysis across single-slice and multi-slice data.	Advances in spatial transcriptomics demand new tools to integrate data across tissue slices and identify consistent spatial domains. We introduce spCLUE, a comprehensive framework combining multi-view graph network, contrastive learning, attention mechanisms, and a batch prompting module to learn informative spot representations and integrate data from both aligned and unaligned samples. spCLUE outperforms nine single-slice and seven multi-slice methods when tested on diverse datasets and reveals biologically relevant domains across different tissues and conditions. spCLUE offers a powerful solution to spatial domain analysis and integration in spatial transcriptomics, enabling more accurate and interpretable studies of tissue organization.
36864611	2023	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Interpretable meta-learning of multi-omics data for survival analysis and pathway enrichment.	MOTIVATION: Despite the success of recent machine learning algorithms' applications to survival analysis, their black-box nature hinders interpretability, which is arguably the most important aspect. Similarly, multi-omics data integration for survival analysis is often constrained by the underlying relationships and correlations that are rarely well understood. The goal of this work is to alleviate the interpretability problem in machine learning approaches for survival analysis and also demonstrate how multi-omics data integration improves survival analysis and pathway enrichment. We use meta-learning, a machine-learning algorithm that is trained on a variety of related datasets and allows quick adaptations to new tasks, to perform survival analysis and pathway enrichment on pan-cancer datasets. In recent machine learning research, meta-learning has been effectively used for knowledge transfer among multiple related datasets. RESULTS: We use meta-learning with Cox hazard loss to show that the integration of TCGA pan-cancer data increases the performance of survival analysis. We also apply advanced model interpretability method called DeepLIFT (Deep Learning Important FeaTures) to show different sets of enriched pathways for multi-omics and transcriptomics data. Our results show that multi-omics cancer survival analysis enhances performance compared with using transcriptomics or clinical data alone. Additionally, we show a correlation between variable importance assignment from DeepLIFT and gene coenrichment, suggesting that genes with higher and similar contribution scores are more likely to be enriched together in the same enrichment sets. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: https://github.com/berkuva/TCGA-omics-integration.
41188035	2025	Genome research	Epigenomics of embryogenesis in turbot.	Embryogenesis is the foundational step of ontogeny, where a complex organism emerges from a single totipotent cell. This process is orchestrated by changes in transcriptional regulation, influenced by chromatin accessibility and epigenetic modifications, enabling transcription factor accessibility. Epigenomic regulation of embryogenesis has been studied in model fish, but little attention has been paid to farmed fish - where relevant traits to aquaculture rely on early developmental processes. This study reports a regulatory atlas of turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) embryogenesis. 14,560 active genes were identified in the embryonic transcriptome with > 90% showing differential expression across consecutive stages. By integrating multi-histone ChIP-seq with ATAC-seq, we built a genome-wide chromatin state model, defining promoter and enhancer activity across stages. Diverse transcription factor binding motifs were detected within regulatory elements showing differential accessibility at distinct developmental stages. Strong shifts in chromatin accessibility across stages, notably during the transition from shield to early segmentation, suggest profound chromatin reorganization underpinning somitogenesis and early organogenesis. Regardless, most changes in chromatin accessibility did not affect promoters of differentially expressed genes, suggesting that their accessibility precedes gene transcription changes. Comparative analyses with zebrafish revealed a global transcriptomic correlation of single-copy orthologs at matched stages. While conserved expression dynamics were revealed for many orthologous Hox genes, notable cross-species differences were identified from pre-ZGA leading up to hatching. This multi-omics investigation provides a novel atlas of noncoding regulatory elements controlling turbot development, with key applications for flatfish biology and sustainable aquaculture.
31873721	2020	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	Multi-omics reveals functional genomic and metabolic mechanisms of milk production and quality in dairy cows.	MOTIVATION: Enhancing the utilization of human-inedible crop by-products by ruminants to produce high-quality milk for human consumption is an emerging global task. We performed a multi-omics-based study to decipher the regulatory biological processes of milk production when cows fed low-quality crop by-products with the aim to improve their utilization. RESULTS: Seven types of different high-throughput omics data were generated across three central organs [rumen, liver and mammary gland (MG)] and biofluids (rumen fluid and blood) that involved in milk production. The integrated multi-omics analysis including metabolomics, metagenomics and transcriptomics showed altered microbiome at compositional and functional levels, microbial metabolites in the rumen, down-regulated genes and associated functions in liver and MG. These changes simultaneously contributed to down-regulated three key metabolic nodes (propionate, glucose and amino acid) across these organs and biofluids that led to lowered milk yield and quality when cows consumed corn stover (CS). Hippuric acid was identified as a biomarker that led to low milk production in CS-fed cows, suggesting a future evaluation parameter related to the metabolic mechanism of low-quality forage utilization. This study unveils the milk production-related biological mechanism across different biofluids and tissues under a low-quality forage diet, which provides a novel understanding and potential improvement strategies for future crop by-products utilization and sustainable ruminant production. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The raw files of metagenomics, metabolomics, and transcriptomics data can be accessed at NCBI SRA (No. SRR5028206), EMBI-EBI (No. MTBLS411), and GEO (NO. GSE78524) databases respectively. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
40022213	2025	Genome biology	CTCF is selectively required for maintaining chromatin accessibility and gene expression in human erythropoiesis.	BACKGROUND: CTCF is considered as the most essential transcription factor regulating chromatin architecture and gene expression. However, genome-wide impact of CTCF on erythropoiesis has not been extensively investigated. RESULTS: Using a state-of-the-art human erythroid progenitor cell model (HUDEP-2 and HEL cell lines), we systematically investigate the effects of acute CTCF loss by an auxin-inducible degron system on transcriptional programs, chromatin accessibility, CTCF genome occupancy, and genome architecture. By integrating multi-omics datasets, we reveal that acute CTCF loss notably disrupts genome-wide chromatin accessibility and the transcription network. We detect over thousands of decreased chromatin accessibility regions but only a few hundred increased regions after CTCF depletion in HUDEP-2 and HEL lines, suggesting the role of CTCF in maintaining proper chromatin openness in the erythroid lineage. CTCF depletion in the erythroid context notably disrupts the boundary integrity of topologically associating domains and chromatin loops but does not affect nuclear compartmentalization. We find erythroid lineage-specific genes, including some metabolism-related genes, are suppressed at immature and mature stages. Notably, we find a subset of genes whose transcriptional levels increase upon CTCF depletion, accompanied by decreased chromatin accessibility regions enriched with the GATA motif. We further decipher the molecular mechanism underlying the CTCF/GATA2 repression axis through distal non-coding chromatin regions. These results suggest a suppressive role of CTCF in gene expression during erythroid lineage specification. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals a novel role of CTCF in regulating erythroid differentiation by maintaining its proper chromatin openness and gene expression network, which extends our understanding of CTCF biology.

MOTIVATION: Asthma is a heterogeneous disease where various subtypes are established and molecular biomarkers of the subtypes are yet to be discovered. Recent availability of multi-omics data paved a way to discover molecular biomarkers for the subtypes. However, multi-omics biomarker discovery is challenging because of the complex interplay between different omics layers. RESULTS: We propose a deep attention model named Gene-level biomarker discovery from multi-Omics data using graph ATtention neural network (GOAT) for identifying molecular biomarkers for eosinophilic asthma subtypes with multi-omics data. GOAT identifies genes that discriminate subtypes using a graph neural network by modeling complex interactions among genes as the attention mechanism in the deep learning model. In experiments with multi-omics profiles of the COREA (Cohort for Reality and Evolution of Adult Asthma in Korea) asthma cohort of 300 patients, GOAT outperforms existing models and suggests interpretable biological mechanisms underlying asthma subtypes. Importantly, GOAT identified genes that are distinct only in terms of relationship with other genes through attention. To better understand the role of biomarkers, we further investigated two transcription factors, CTNNB1 and JUN, captured by GOAT. We were successful in showing the role of the transcription factors in eosinophilic asthma pathophysiology in a network propagation and transcriptional network analysis, which were not distinct in terms of gene expression level differences.

31988518	2020	Nature methods	Statistical analysis of spatial expression patterns for spatially resolved transcriptomic studies.	Identifying genes that display spatial expression patterns in spatially resolved transcriptomic studies is an important first step toward characterizing the spatial transcriptomic landscape of complex tissues. Here we present a statistical method, SPARK, for identifying spatial expression patterns of genes in data generated from various spatially resolved transcriptomic techniques. SPARK directly models spatial count data through generalized linear spatial models. It relies on recently developed statistical formulas for hypothesis testing, providing effective control of type I errors and yielding high statistical power. With a computationally efficient algorithm, which is based on penalized quasi-likelihood, SPARK is also scalable to datasets with tens of thousands of genes measured on tens of thousands of samples. Analyzing four published spatially resolved transcriptomic datasets using SPARK, we show it can be up to ten times more powerful than existing methods and disclose biological discoveries that otherwise cannot be revealed by existing approaches.
41084016	2025	Genome biology	Spatial and single-cell expression analyses reveal complex expression domains in early wheat spike development.	BACKGROUND: Wheat is important for global food security. Understanding the molecular mechanisms driving spike and spikelet development can benefit the development of more productive varieties. RESULTS: Here we integrate single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to generate an atlas of cell clusters and expression domains during the early stages of wheat spike development. We characterize spatiotemporal expression of 99 genes by smFISH in 48,225 cells at early transition (W1.5), late double ridge (W2.5), and floret primordia stages (W3.5). These cells are grouped into 21 different expression domains, including four in the basal region of the developing spikelets and three different meristematic regions, which are consistent across spikelets and sections. Using induced mutants, we reveal functional roles associated with the specific expression patterns of LFY in intercalary meristems, SPL14 in inflorescence meristems, and FZP in glume axillae. Complementary scRNA-seq profiling of 26,009 cells from W2.5 and W3.5 stages identifies 23 distinct cell clusters. We use the scRNA-seq information to impute the expression of 74,464 genes into the spatially anchored smFISH-labelled cells and generate a public website to visualize them. We then use experimental and imputed expression profiles, together with co-expression studies and correlation matrices, to annotate the scRNA-seq clusters. From co-expression analyses, we identify genes associated with boundary genes TCP24 and FZP, as well as the meristematic genes AGL6 and ULT1. CONCLUSIONS: The smFISH and scRNA-seq studies provide complementary tools for dissecting gene networks that regulate spike development and identifying new co-expressed genes for functional characterization.
